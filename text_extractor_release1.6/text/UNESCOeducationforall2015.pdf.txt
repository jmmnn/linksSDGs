1025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportForeword

In 2000, at the World Education Forum in Dakar, Senegal, 164 governments agreed on 
the Dakar Framework for Action, Education for All: Meeting our Collective Commitments, 
launching an ambitious agenda to reach six wide-ranging education goals by 2015. 
UNESCO initiated the EFA Global Monitoring Reports in response, to monitor progress, 
highlight remaining gaps and provide recommendations for the global sustainable 
development agenda to follow in 2015.

There has been tremendous progress across the world since 2000 – but we are not there 
yet. Despite all efforts by governments, civil society and the international community, the 
world has not achieved Education for All. 

On the positive side, the number of children and adolescents who were out of school 
has fallen by almost half since 2000. An estimated 34 million more children will have 
attended school as a result of faster progress since Dakar. The greatest progress has 
been achieved in gender parity, particularly in primary education, although gender 
disparity remains in almost a third of the countries with data. Governments have also 
increased efforts to measure learning outcomes through national and international 
assessments, using these to ensure that all children receive the quality of education 
they were promised.

And yet, for all this progress, 15 years of monitoring shows sobering results.

There are still 58 million children out of school globally and around 100 million children 
who do not complete primary education. Inequality in education has increased, with the 
poorest and most disadvantaged shouldering the heaviest burden. The world’s poorest 
children are four times more likely not to go to school than the world’s richest children, 
and five times more likely not to complete primary school. Conflict remains a steep 
barrier, with a high and growing proportion of out-of-school children living in conflict 
zones. Overall, the poor quality of learning at primary level still has millions of children 
leaving school without basic skills. 

What is more, education remains under-financed. Many governments have increased 
spending, but few have prioritized education in national budgets, and most fall short of 
allocating the recommended 20% needed to bridge funding gaps. The picture is similar 
with donors, who, after an initial boost in aid budgets, have reduced aid to education 
since 2010 and not sufficiently prioritized those countries most in need.

This Report draws on all of this experience, to make sharp recommendations for 
the place of education in the future global sustainable development agenda. The 
lessons are clear. New education targets must be specific, relevant and measurable. 
Marginalized and disadvantaged groups, hardest to reach and still not enjoying their 

i

FOREWORDright to education, must be a priority. There must be stronger action on financing across 
the board. While the bulk of costs will be borne by governments, the international 
community must step up, to sustain and increase aid to education – especially in low 
and lower middle income countries where needs are greatest. The future agenda will 
also need ever-stronger monitoring efforts, including data collection, analysis and 
dissemination, to hold all stakeholders to account. 

In the run-up to 2015, EFA Global Monitoring Reports have played a leading role in 
supporting countries, providing solid assessment and analysis to facilitate policy-
making, along with a powerful advocacy tool for governments and civil society. This will 
continue as we turn to implementing the new Sustainable Development Goals. After 
2015, the Reports will continue to provide a trusted and independent voice on the state 
of global education, producing useful recommendations to all countries and partners. 
So much has been achieved since 2000 – we need to do far more, to ensure quality 
education and lifelong learning for all. There is simply no more powerful or longer-
lasting investment in human rights and dignity, in social inclusion and sustainable 
development. Experience since 2000 shows what can be done – we need to draw on 
this to do more.

LIST OF FIGURES, INFOGRAPHICS, TABLES AND TEXT BOXESExecutive Summary

The 2015 EFA Global Monitoring Report provides a complete assessment of progress 
towards the Education for All goals established in 2000 at the World Education Forum in 
Dakar, Senegal. The report takes stock of whether the world achieved the EFA goals and 
whether EFA partners upheld their commitments. It also explains possible determinants 
of the pace of progress and identifies key lessons for shaping a post-2015 global 
education agenda.

Taking stock of progress towards EFA

Goal 1 – Early childhood care and education

Expanding and improving comprehensive early childhood care and education, especially for 
the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children

 ■ Despite a drop in child mortality rates of nearly 50%, 6.3 million children under the 

age of 5 died in 2013 from causes that are mostly preventable.

 ■ Progress in improving child nutrition has been considerable. Yet globally, one 

in four children are still short for their age – a sign of chronic deficiency in 
essential nutrients.

 ■ In 2012, 184 million children were enrolled in pre-primary education worldwide, an 

increase of nearly two-thirds since 1999.

Goal 2 – Universal primary education

Ensuring that by 2015 all children, particularly girls, children in difficult circumstances and 
those belonging to ethnic minorities, have access to and complete free and compulsory 
primary education of good quality

 ■ The primary school net enrolment ratio was 84% in 1999 and is estimated to 

reach 93% in 2015.

 ■ Net enrolment ratios improved significantly, rising at least 20 percentage points from 

1999 to 2012 in 17 countries, 11 of which were in sub-Saharan Africa.

 ■ While some increases in enrolment ratios are evident, nearly 58 million children were 

out of school in 2012, and progress in reducing this number has stalled.

 ■ Despite progress in access, dropout remains an issue: in 32 countries, mostly in 
sub-Saharan Africa, at least 20% of children enrolled are not expected to reach 
the last grade.

 ■ By the 2015 deadline, one in six children in low and middle income countries – or 

almost 100 million – will not have completed primary school.

xii

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY1025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportGoal 3 – Youth and adult skills

Ensuring that the learning needs of all young people and adults are met through equitable 
access to appropriate learning and life skills programmes

 ■ Reflecting improved transition rates and higher retention rates, the lower secondary 

gross enrolment ratio increased from 71% in 1999 to 85% in 2012. Participation in 
lower secondary education has increased quickly since 1999. In Afghanistan, China, 
Ecuador, Mali and Morocco, the lower secondary gross enrolment ratio has increased 
by at least 25 percentage points.

 ■ Inequality persists in the transition from primary to secondary school. For example, 

in the Philippines, just 69% of primary school graduates from the poorest families 
continued into lower secondary, compared with 94% from the richest households.

 ■ A majority of the 94 low and middle income countries with information have 

legislated free lower secondary education since 1999. Of these, 66 have constitutional 
guarantees and 28 enacted other legal measures. As of 2015, only a few nations 
charge lower secondary school fees, including Botswana, Guinea, Papua New Guinea, 
South Africa and the United Republic of Tanzania.

Goal 4 – Adult literacy

Achieving a 50 per cent improvement in levels of adult literacy by 2015, especially for women, 
and equitable access to basic and continuing education for all adults

 ■ There are about 781 million illiterate adults. The rate of illiteracy dropped slightly, 
from 18% in 2000 to an estimated 14% in 2015, which means the Dakar target of 
halving illiteracy was not achieved.

 ■ Only 17 out of the 73 countries with a literacy rate below 95% in 2000 had halved their 

illiteracy rate by 2015.

 ■ Progress has been made towards gender parity in literacy but is not sufficient. All 43 

countries where fewer than 90 women for every 100 men were literate in 2000 have 
moved towards parity, but none of them will have reached it by 2015.

Goal 5 – Gender equality

Eliminating gender disparities in primary and secondary education by 2005, and achieving 
gender equality in education by 2015, with a focus on ensuring girls’ full and equal access to 
and achievement in basic education of good quality.

 ■ At the primary level, 69% of the countries with data are expected to have reached 

gender parity by 2015. Progress is slower in secondary education, with 48% projected 
to be at gender parity in 2015.

 ■ Progress in tackling severe gender disparity has been made. Between 1999 and 2012, 
the number of countries with fewer than 90 girls enrolled in primary school for every 
100 boys fell from 33 to 16.

xiii

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ■ Amongst out-of-school children, girls are more likely than boys never to enrol  
in school (48% compared with 37%), while boys are more likely to leave school  
(26% compared with 20%). Once enrolled, girls are more likely to reach the 
upper grades.

 ■ In sub-Saharan Africa, the poorest girls remain the most likely to never attend 

primary school. In Guinea and Niger in 2010, over 70% of the poorest girls had never 
attended primary school, compared with less than 20% of the richest boys.

Goal 6 – Quality of education

Improving all aspects of the quality of education and ensuring excellence of all so that 
recognized and measurable learning outcomes are achieved by all, especially in literacy, 
numeracy and essential life skills

 ■ Pupil/teacher ratios declined in 83% of the 146 countries with data at the primary 
education level. In one-third of the countries with data, however, less than 75% of 
primary school teachers are trained up to national standards.

 ■ At the lower secondary education level, 87 of the 105 countries with data have a pupil/

teacher ratio below 30:1.

 ■ In 1990, 12 learning assessments were conducted according to national standards, 

but by 2013 the number had increased to 101.

Financing education 

 ■ Many countries have increased spending on education. Between 1999 and 2012, 38 

countries increased their spending by 1 percentage point or more of national income.

 ■ Education is not a priority in many national budgets. As a share of government 

spending, expenditure on education has changed little since 1999 and at 13.7% in 
2012, falls short of the recommended 15% to 20% target.

 ■ Governments and donors have neglected to fund EFA goals outside of primary 
education. As a result, pre-primary education and adult literacy, in particular,  
remain underfunded. 

 ■ Donors have largely failed on their commitment to deliver aid more effectively, 

achieving just 1 of 13 aid effectiveness targets. Effective international coordination 
and distribution of aid to education have been almost entirely absent.

Were the 12 strategies from the Dakar Framework sufficient to contribute to the five 
key medium-term results expected of an effective EFA architecture? In assessing 
whether political commitment to EFA was reaffirmed and sustained throughout 
the period, it is clear that the EFA movement suffered once the MDGs became the 
dominant development agenda. The result was excessive emphasis on universal primary 

xiv

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY1025Education for All Global Monitoring Reporteducation. UNESCO proved cautious in its approach to high-level political engagement, 
so the forum of choice for global policy actors in education shifted away from the High-
Level Group. The assumption that global and regional conferences are powerful enough 
to hold countries and the international community to account has not proved to be valid. 

Since 2000, diverse types of knowledge,  evidence and expertise have been 
communicated and used. Much new evidence and many policy initiatives and research 
advances were not necessarily related to EFA activities, and too often came from outside 
the education sector. While some of the new evidence did reach EFA coordination 
meetings, it did not appear to be used for policy-making. 

Since 2000, there has been no shortage of national education plans. However, it is 
less clear that new knowledge or tools have helped develop appropriate capacity for 
evidence-based national policy-making or that they have strengthened national EFA 
policy and practice. 

A key expected result of the Dakar process was that credible plans would help 
effectively mobilize financial resources for EFA. The rise in domestic education 
spending in low income countries was promising, but its main cause was increased 
domestic resource mobilization. International aid expanded considerably in absolute 
terms, yet its volume fell well short of the assessed need. 

The decision to introduce an independent monitoring and reporting mechanism of 
progress towards the EFA goals may have been critical in keeping EFA high on the 
agenda. But improved reporting was only possible thanks to major improvement in data 
quality and analysis, often supported by EFA partners. 

Efforts since 2000 to advance education around the world became almost synonymous 
with ensuring that every child is in school. As this EFA – and MDG – target of universal 
access to primary education was more applicable to the poorest countries, other nations 
found it less relevant. Meanwhile, the focus on universal primary enrolment meant less 
attention to other crucial areas, such as education quality, early childhood care and 
education, and adult literacy. 

Overall, not even the target of universal primary education was reached, let alone 
the more ambitious EFA goals, and the most disadvantaged continue to be the last to 
benefit. But there have been achievements that should not be underestimated. The 
world has advanced by 2015 beyond where it would have been if the trends of the 1990s 
had persisted. And monitoring education progress since Dakar has also improved 
and expanded. 

In the end, the EFA movement can be characterized as a qualified success, even if EFA 
partners may have not collectively lived up to their commitments. But a lesson re-
emerging over the past 15 years is that, while technical solutions are important, gaining 
political influence and traction is of even greater significance, particularly to realize the 
scale of reform and action required to achieve EFA at the national level. The current 
discussions on the post-2015 agenda may be offering just such a chance. 

xv

EXECUTIVE SUMMARYEducation for All since 2000:  
A qualified success?

The Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989 
and the World Declaration on Education for All 
(EFA) in 1990 in Jomtien, Thailand, reaffirmed 
education as a human right and heralded a 
new environment of international cooperation. 
However, reality did not live up to the promise. 
The progress of the 1990s for education was 
seen as insufficient, especially in the countries 
furthest from reaching key education targets.

The international community assembled in 
Dakar, Senegal, in April 2000 to set an agenda 
for making progress in education to 2015. At 
the World Education Forum, governments from 
164 countries, together with representatives of 
regional groups, international organizations, 
donor agencies, non-government organizations 
(NGOs) and civil society, adopted a Framework 
for Action (‘the Dakar Framework’) to deliver 
EFA commitments. The Dakar Framework 
comprised two key elements: 6 goals, and 
associated targets, to be achieved by 2015,1 and 
12 strategies to which all stakeholders would 
contribute (Box 0.1).

The EFA Global Monitoring Report (GMR) has 
monitored progress on an almost annual basis 
towards the EFA goals, and the two education-
related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), 
since 2002. This GMR has particular significance 
as it provides a complete assessment of 
progress since Dakar towards the target date 
for reaching the Dakar Framework’s goals. It 
has three objectives. First, it aims to take stock 
of whether the world achieved the EFA goals 
and stakeholders upheld their commitments 
to implement the agenda. Second, it intends 
to explain possible determinants of the 
pace of progress and whether a direct link 
can be established between the strategies’ 
implementation and the achievement of the 
goals, or lack thereof. Finally, it hopes to learn,  
in particular to identify key messages for shaping 
a post-2015 global education agenda.

1. A key target under the gender equality goal, parity at the primary and 
secondary education level, was to be achieved by 2005.

The chapter pursues these objectives in three 
ways. First, it provides an assessment of 
whether the world is on track to achieve the 
targets explicitly identified in EFA documents. 
As clear and measurable targets were not set 
for all the objectives embedded in each goal, the 
chapter selectively reviews progress by using 
indicators that capture relevant elements of 
the goals. By necessity, this exercise involves 
projections, since the most recent data refer 
to 2012 or earlier. A complementary analysis 
assesses the speed with which the world 
moved towards selected targets, comparing the 
record of the period since Dakar to that of the 
preceding decade. Overall, there are examples 
of considerable progress, even if the targets 
themselves were not met. This chapter focuses 
on the global level; detailed discussion of 
country-level progress is included in the goal-
specific chapters that follow.

Second, the chapter explores possible drivers of 
change in relation to the EFA goals. Education 
systems may grow, or stagnate, even in the 
absence of international commitments. There 
are reasons to believe that events in recent years 
were more favourable overall to educational 
development than in the 1990s, which may help 
explain some of the progress observed.

Third, the chapter asks whether the 
implementation of the Dakar-based EFA agenda 
may itself have contributed to global progress. 
It describes the global channels and processes 
that participants in the World Education Forum 
believed would help mobilize action at the 
national level, and reports on their application. 
It then assesses whether these processes and 
actions were necessary and sufficient to achieve 
the desired educational outcomes. It concludes 
that some notable breakthroughs may have 
contributed to overall progress at the global 
and regional levels, but that far less was done 
than promised in the key areas of coordination 
and financing.

This GMR 
aims to take 
stock, explain 
and learn

OVERVIEWEducation for All Global Monitoring Report1025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportTaking stock of progress 
towards EFA

The EFA goals tackled an ambitious set of 
challenges for global education. Since 2002, 
the GMRs have focused on targets indicative 
of progress towards each goal. Approaching 
the 2015 deadline, the following key 
messages emerge:

 ■ While there has been some progress in 

universal access to education, compared 
to 1999 when there were 204 million out-
of-school children and adolescents of 
primary and lower secondary school age 
(or 19% of the population), there were still 
121 million out of school in 2012 (or 12% of 
the population).

 ■ The second MDG and EFA goal 2 both 

envisaged all children completing a full cycle 
of primary education. Yet, in low and middle 
income countries in 2015, one in six children 
will not have completed primary school. In 
addition, one in three adolescents will not 
have completed lower secondary school.

 ■ Although it is projected that by 2015 gender 

parity will be achieved, on average at the 
global level, in primary and secondary 
education, 3 in 10 countries at the primary 

level and 5 in 10 at the secondary level are 
projected not to achieve this target.

 ■ The adult illiteracy rate will have fallen by 

only 23% since 2000, instead of the targeted 
50%, and most of the decrease is due to the 
transition into adulthood of larger cohorts of 
better-educated children. At least 750 million 
adults, nearly two-thirds of them women, 
will not even have rudimentary literacy 
skills in 2015.

Progress on some indicators of educational 
development has accelerated since 2000, with 
more children entering school and completing 
their education. For example, it is expected 
that by 2015 some 20 million more children 
will have completed primary school in low and 
middle income countries than would have been 
the case if the pre-2000 rate of progress had 
been maintained.

However, the GMR also finds that educational 
development continues to be unequally shared. 
Disadvantaged children still lag behind their 
peers. For example, the probability that children 
from the poorest quintile of households in low

The treatment of early childhood care and 
education in the Dakar Framework had its roots 
in the rights-based approach of the Convention 
on the Rights of the Child. Since 2000, there has 
been an increasing focus on early childhood, 
in both poor and rich countries, informed by 
evidence of its fundamental consequences 
for future individual well-being, with further 
research emerging of the importance of the first 
1,000 days after conception (see Chapter 1).

The Dakar Framework did not set specific 
targets on early childhood care and education 
to be achieved by 2015. In their absence, the 
GMR monitored selected indicators that were 
deemed closest to key concepts related to goal 
1, including survival, health and nutrition, and 
access to learning opportunities.

Regarding survival, progress has been made 
on the target associated with the fourth MDG 
to reduce under-5 child mortality by two-thirds 
between 1990 and 2015. By 2013, the target 
had been met by 53 countries among 192 with 
the relevant data. Between 1990 and 2000, the 
level of child mortality fell globally from 90 to 
76 deaths per 1,000 live births, and by 2013 it 
had reached 46. However, the 2015 target of 30 
deaths per 1,000 live births is unlikely to be met. 

East Asia and the Pacific and Latin America 
and the Caribbean are expected to do so, but 
sub-Saharan Africa is not, and its child mortality 
rate is expected to be above the global average, 
despite progress accelerating after 2000. Still, 
the total number of children dying before their 
fifth birthday has been halved, from 12.7 million 
in 1990 to 6.3 million in 2013 (IGME, 2014).

In terms of nutrition, progress has been made 
towards meeting the target associated with the 
first MDG on poverty and hunger, to halve the 
prevalence of underweight children between 
1990 and 2015: underweight prevalence fell from 
25% in 1990 to 15% in 2013, although the target 
will be missed (UNICEF et al., 2014).

A robust indicator of the cumulative effects 
of child malnutrition, as well as poor health 
in utero and during the first two years, is the 
prevalence of moderate or severe stunting, when 
children are short for their age. No concrete 
target was set at the global level. While the 
stunting rate fell from 40% in 1990 to 24.5% in 
2013, the cognitive and physical development of 
about 161 million children under 5 remains at 
risk (UNICEF et al., 2014). As with child mortality, 
sub-Saharan Africa experienced a much slower 
rate of improvement: its stunting rate fell from

and in East Asia and the Pacific the stunting 
rate fell by more than 25 percentage points 
(Figure 0.1).

Since 2000, early childhood education services 
have expanded considerably. Globally, pre-
primary education enrolment increased by 
almost two-thirds, and it rose by almost two and 
a half times in sub-Saharan Africa and South 
and West Asia. The global pre-primary gross 
enrolment ratio increased from 27% in 1990 to 
33% in 1999 and 54% in 2012 and, if it continued 
to rise at the 1999–2012 rate, would reach 58% 
by 2015 (Figure 0.2).

However, there are wide differences among 
regions. While the ratio was 74% in Latin America 
and the Caribbean and 89% in North America 
and Western Europe in 2012, it was only 20% in 
sub-Saharan Africa and 25% in the Arab States. 
Countries in transition returned to a positive 
trend after 1999 following a reduction of pre-
primary education services during the 1990s. 
However, while enrolment levels were higher 
than in 1990 in Central and Eastern Europe, they 
remained well below that level in Central Asia.

While too few countries report information 
on the individual characteristics of children 
attending pre-school to allow a global estimate 
of inequality (see Chapter 1), gaps in pre-
primary enrolment have continued to exist not 
only among but also within countries, especially 
between urban and rural areas. A key reason 
for such inequality is that many countries have 
yet to expand public provision of pre-primary 
education. The result is that many families

enrolment in private institutions increased from 
28% in 1999 to 31% in 2012, which represents 
both a higher level and a bigger increase than in 
primary and secondary education. Evidence from 
household surveys suggests that the true extent 
of private provision may be underestimated 
in many countries where regulation of the 
sector is weak.

Chapter 1 discusses the increasing use 
of multisector, coordinated approaches to 
early childhood care and education, and also 
examines quality in provision, with a focus on 
the impact of educators who lack preparation, 
training and social status.

The achievement of universal primary education 
has been considered the most important EFA 
indicator, despite its representing only part of the 
ambitions for global progress in education. This 
is at least partly because of the dominant role 
the second MDG played. Unfortunately, the target 
is still far from being met. Despite an increase in 
the global primary adjusted net enrolment ratio 
from 84% in 1999 to 91% in 2007, the indicator 
has since stagnated. At best, if earlier rates 
of progress resume, it will reach 93% by 2015 
(Figure 0.3).

Across regions, the largest absolute increases 
in the primary adjusted net enrolment ratio were 

observed in sub-Saharan Africa (from 59% in 
1999 to 79% in 2012) and South and West Asia 
(from 78% to 94%). Only in North America and 
Western Europe did the ratio decline (from  
98% to 96%). This is due to the United States, 
where the population of homeschooled  
children doubled from 1999 to 2007 (Davis  
and Baumann, 2013).

As of 2012, almost 58 million children of  
primary school age were out of school, down 
from 106 million in 1999. Just over half of them 
live in sub-Saharan Africa, a considerable 
increase compared to 1999, when the region 
accounted for 40% of the total. By contrast,

out-of-school children lived in 1999, accounted 
for 17% of the total in 2012 (Figure 0.4).

Projecting the number of out-of-school 
children to 2015 depends on the period used for 
reference. Based on the trends of the past five 
years, 57 million children would still be out of 
school in 2015. If the period is extended to reflect 
the rapid improvement of the first post-Dakar 
years, and it is assumed such progress resumes 
in the remainder of the period, the more 
optimistic projection is for the out-of-school 
population to fall to 46 million. In either scenario, 
the goal is not reached.

There are three categories of out-of-school 
children: those who will eventually go to school; 
those who will never go; and those who were 
enrolled but left. Estimates for 2012 indicate 
that about 25 million, or 43% of out-of-school 
children, will never go to school; the rate is 50% 

in sub-Saharan Africa and 57% in South and 
West Asia. There is also considerable gender 
disparity, with girls more likely never to go to 
school (48% of the total, compared with 37% 
for boys), while boys are relatively more likely to 
leave school (Figure 0.5).

57 children

OVERVIEWThe problem of out-of-school children is 
becoming increasingly concentrated in conflict-
affected countries, where the proportion 
increased from 30% in 1999 to 36% in 2012. 
This trend is particularly strong in the Arab 
States (the proportion increased from 63% to 
87%) and South and West Asia (from 21% to 
42%). By contrast, there has been no change 
in sub-Saharan Africa, where the proportion 
remains about 35%.

Analysis of household surveys shows that major 
inequality exists regarding those who are out 
of school. Among 63 countries observed during 
2008–2012, where an average of 14% of children 
were out of school, the rate was 22% for those in 
the poorest household quintile and 6% for those 
in the richest. Likewise, the average out-of-
school rate was 16% in rural areas compared 
with 8% in urban areas (UIS and UNICEF, 2015).

Chapter 2 looks at the barriers faced by 
different groups of marginalized children and 
how governments have tried to respond to their 
needs. The groups include children belonging 
to ethnic and linguistic minorities or nomadic 
communities, children with disabilities, those 
living in slums, and those who work.

Goal 2 of the Dakar Framework aims to ensure 
that all children ‘have access to and complete’ 
primary education. It is therefore useful to look 
separately at the percentages of children who 
have never been to school and of those who 
manage to finish primary education.

Analysis by the GMR team of household surveys 
confirms significant gains in access to school 
in low and middle income countries. The 
percentage of children who had never been 
to school across all low and middle income 
countries fell from 10% in 1999 to 7% in 2008. In 
low income countries, the rate fell from 32% in 
1992 to 23% in 1999 and 14% in 2008 (Figure 0.6). 
One in four children from the poorest quintile of 
households in low income countries had not been 
to school in 2008; the lack of access among the 
most disadvantaged is still too high.

The percentage of children in a cohort who 
reach the last grade of primary school continued 
to increase. But evidence from administrative 
data in low and middle income countries 
suggests that, of those who start school, the 
percentage who reach the last grade has 
hardly changed. For example, it was stagnant 
in sub-Saharan Africa at 58% and in South and 
West Asia at 64% between 1999 and 2011.

However, GMR team analysis of household surveys 
shows that as higher numbers entered school, the 
percentage of those who finished primary school 
in low and middle income countries increased, 
from 77% in 1999 to 81% in 2008 (Figure 0.7).  
It is expected to reach 84% in 2015. This means, 
nevertheless, that by the 2015 deadline, one in six 
children in those countries – or almost 100 million 
– will not have completed primary school. And 
more than one in three in low income countries 
will not have done so, despite acceleration in the 
primary attainment rate after 1999.

OVERVIEWEducation for All Global Monitoring Report1025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportThe most disadvantaged are those still furthest 
from achieving universal primary completion. 
Analysis by the GMR team of household surveys 
in low and middle income countries suggests 
that inequality in primary school attainment 
remains high across different dimensions, 
but notably in terms of household wealth. The 
probability that children from the poorest quintile 
of households would not attain primary school 
in 2010 was more than five times higher than 

the corresponding probability of children from 
the richest quintile, a ratio that has slightly 
increased compared with 2000 (Figure 0.8). 

Chapter 2 discusses policies implemented by 
countries since 2000 that aimed to increase 
the supply of schooling as well as to raise 
demand for education, by reducing costs through 
measures such as cash transfer and school 
feeding programmes.

The third EFA goal aimed to ensure ‘that the 
learning needs of all young people and adults 
are met through equitable access to appropriate 
learning and life skills programmes’. There 
have been major changes in the way skills 
are conceptualized, and some countries have 
begun to measure them directly. However, these 
changes are coming too late and cannot provide 
evidence of the global status of skill acquisition, 
let alone evidence of global trends.

The GMR has focused mainly on progress 
in secondary education as a proxy for the 
foundational skills needed in work and life. 
Secondary education enrolment increased by 
27% globally. The gross enrolment ratio rose 
in lower secondary education from 71% in 
1999 to 85% in 2012, and in upper secondary 
from 45% to 62%.

Wide disparity exists among regions: while the 
lower secondary gross enrolment ratio was 
above 95% in most regions in 2012, it was 89% in 
the Arab States, 81% in South and West Asia and 
50% in sub-Saharan Africa. Inequality is more 
pronounced at the upper secondary level, where 
the gross enrolment ratio was around 100% 
in North America and Western Europe and in 
Central Asia, but 32% in sub-Saharan Africa.

While the gross enrolment ratio is a measure of 
participation based on those in school regardless 
of their age, another measure focuses on 
the age group. The lower secondary total net 
enrolment ratio, which shows the percentage of 
the population of lower secondary school age 
enrolled in secondary or still in primary school, 
increased from 74% in 1999 to 83% in 2012. It is 
projected to reach 86% by 2015 (Figure 0.9).

The lower secondary total net enrolment ratio is 
the basis for calculating the number of out-of-
school adolescents. The increase in the ratio 
translates into a reduction in the number of 
out-of-school adolescents of lower secondary 
school age from 99 million in 1999 to 63 million 
in 2012. Progress in East Asia and the Pacific 
accounts for more than half the total decline. 
About 42% of out-of-school adolescents now 
live in South and West Asia. The number of out-
of-school adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa 
remained 21 million throughout the period as a 
result of population growth, despite a decrease 
in the out-of-school rate from 46% to 33% 
(Figure 0.10).

As with primary education, projecting the 
number of out-of-school adolescents to 2015 
depends on the reference period. Between 2007 

East Asia and 
the Pacific 
account for 
more than half 
the decline in 
out-of-school 
adolescents 

10

OVERVIEWEducation for All Global Monitoring Report1025Education for All Global Monitoring Reportand 2012, the lower secondary total net 
enrolment ratio stagnated at about 82%. If those 
five years are used as the reference, 61 million 
adolescents would still be out of school by 2015. 
If the period is extended to reflect the rapid 
improvement of the early post-Dakar years, 
assuming progress resumes in the rest of the 
period, the out-of-school population would fall to 
56 million by 2015 (Figure 0.10).

Measures of participation do not indicate 
the percentage of those who finish lower 

secondary school. Analysis by the GMR team 
of household surveys shows that the lower 
secondary attainment rate increased from 25% 
in 1999 to 31% in 2008 in low income countries, 
from 52% to 64% in lower middle income 
countries and from 81% to 85% in upper middle 
income countries (Figure 0.11). Overall, one 
in three individuals in low and middle income 
countries are projected not to have finished 
lower secondary school by 2015. In low income 
countries, three in five individuals would not 
have done so.

OVERVIEWThe problem 
of inequality 
extends to 
future learning 
opportunities

Chapter 3 discusses in more detail inequality 
faced by particular groups, such as working 
adolescents and migrants, and documents the 
relatively limited scope of alternative, non-formal 
and other programmes that offer a second 

chance to complete schooling. It also notes 
that the problem of inequality extends to future 
learning opportunities: adults with secondary 
education have more chances to benefit from 
adult education programmes than those without.

The goal 4 target was to halve the adult illiteracy 
rate between 2000 and 2015. While the rate fell 
from 24% to 18% between 1990 and 2000, the 
pace of decline then slowed. According to most 
recent estimates, the adult illiteracy rate has 
fallen to 16% and is projected to be 14% by 2015. 
Thus the projected fall in the adult illiteracy rate 
would be 23% between 2000 and 2015, well short 
of the target (Figure 0.12a).

An important reason for this is the increasing 
share of population in sub-Saharan Africa, the 
region with both the highest illiteracy rate (41%) 
and the slowest progress (a 13% decline between 
2000 and 2015). However, assessment of the 
region’s progress is complicated by changes in 
the source of literacy data in many countries. 
Where countries could not provide recent census 
data on literacy based on self-assessment, the 
UIS used household surveys containing direct 
assessments of literacy, which yielded lower 
estimates of how many adults could read. Thus 
estimates of adult literacy in sub-Saharan Africa 
for the most recent period may be more 
accurate but are not strictly comparable with the 
estimates for 2000 or for other regions.

Between 2000 and 2015, the adult illiteracy rate 
is projected to fall by 26% in South and West 
Asia, 36% in Latin America and the Caribbean, 
and 39% in the Arab States. The reduction will 
therefore fall short of the target. However, the 
target will be reached in Central and Eastern 

Europe (-52%), East Asia and the Pacific (-52%) 
and Central Asia (-65%).

Progress was uneven in the regions where 
women were lagging furthest behind. There 
was fast progress in the Arab States during the 
2000s, as the female adult literacy rate increased 
from 56% in 2000 to 69% in 2010, while the 
gender parity index increased from 73 literate 
women for every 100 literate men to 81. However, 
this progress is expected to slow by 2015. By 
contrast, in South and West Asia, the adult 
female literacy rate increased from 47% in 2000 
to 52% in 2010 and is expected to reach 60% by 
2015, when the projected gender parity index will 
be 76 literate women for every 100 literate men. 
South and West Asia will remain the region with 
the biggest gender disparity, even if its female 
adult literacy rate is above that in sub-Saharan 
Africa (Figure 0.12a). Overall, 64% of illiterate 
adults will be female in 2015, a percentage that 
will not have changed since 2000.

The number of illiterate adults is projected to 
fall by 4% between 2000 and 2015, from 787 
million to 751 million (note, however, the above 
caveat on comparability). Only Central Asia 
and Central and Eastern Europe are projected 
to halve their population of illiterate adults by 
2015. Demographic developments mean the 
population of illiterate adults will likely remain 
constant in South and West Asia between 2000 
and 2015 at 388 million (or 52% of the total) 

In South and 
West Asia,

from 20% to 26%).

literacy rate. The largest positive gaps are in 
South and West Asia (18 percentage points) and 
the Arab States (12 percentage points).

Literacy skills are best developed in childhood 
through good quality education. They are 
sustained by continual practice in literate 
environments at work or in the community 
and through adult and continuing education. A 
review of 30 developing countries for this GMR 
shows that, since 2000, hardly any have been 
able to build broad-based frameworks for adult 
education that offer genuine opportunities for 
literacy acquisition. Moreover, the analysis shows 
that the literacy rate for a particular cohort of 
adults does not improve, or even falls as literacy 
skills are lost when not used (see Chapter 4).

To move towards universal adult literacy, youth 
literacy rates need to improve. The most up-to-
date global youth literacy rate stands at 89%, 
five percentage points higher than the adult 

By 2015 in South and West Asia, the youth 
literacy rate is projected to be just 4 percentage 
points short of the global average, compared 
with 9 points in 2010 and 23 in 1990. For young 
women, the youth literacy rate is projected to 
be just 5 percentage points under the global 
average by 2015, compared with gaps of 12 
points in 2010 and 30 in 1990 (Figure 0.12b).

Chapter 4 discusses developments that may 
have contributed to a faster decline in illiteracy 
rates, such as renewed interest in literacy 
programmes, including those that promoted the 
use of mother tongue. Likewise, more potential 
opportunities appeared for the use of literacy 
skills. However, these factors seem to have had 
only a marginal influence so far on improving the 
literacy skills of the adult population.

Among the EFA goals, the greatest progress has 
been achieved in gender parity. The third MDG, 
which included parity in education as one of its 
targets, was influential. However, it is less clear 
how much progress has been achieved towards 
actual equality.

In primary education, there was considerable 
disparity in 1999 at the global level, with 92 girls 
enrolled for every 100 boys. By 2012, the global 

average had increased to 97, just above the 
threshold of parity. South and West Asia made 
the strongest progress, achieving parity from the 
lowest starting point: 83 girls enrolled for every 
100 boys. Sub-Saharan Africa and the Arab States 
halved the parity gap but remained the regions 
furthest from the target at 92 and 93 girls, 
respectively, for every 100 boys (Figure 0.13a). Of 
the 16 countries with fewer than 90 girls for every 
100 boys enrolled, 13 are in sub-Saharan Africa.

OVERVIEWEducation for All Global Monitoring Report1025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportIn the Arab 
States, the 
number of girls 
enrolled for 
every 100 boys 
increased from 
87 in 1999 to 
95 in 2012

Secondary education was very similar. At the 
global level, the disparity in 1999 was 91 girls 
enrolled for every 100 boys. By 2012, the global 
average had increased to almost 97 girls, 
just below the threshold of parity. South and 
West Asia again made the strongest progress, 
from 75 girls enrolled for every 100 boys, the 
lowest starting point, to 93, with rapid progress 
at both the lower and upper secondary levels 
(Figures 0.13b and 0.13c). The Arab States made 
progress, too, as the number of girls enrolled 
for every 100 boys increased from 87 in 1999 to 
95 in 2012. Sub-Saharan Africa was the region 
left furthest behind with the slowest progress 
towards parity, increasing from 82 to 84 girls for 
every 100 boys. East Asia and the Pacific reached 
parity, while Latin America and the Caribbean 
was the only region with disparity at the expense 
of boys: 93 boys enrolled for every 100 girls.

or fewer than 80 boys for every 100 girls enrolled 
– tended to decline at all levels. For example, 
at the upper secondary level, the proportion of 
countries with large disparities at the expense of 
girls fell from 19% in 1999 to 11% in 2012, while 
those with large disparities at the expense of 
boys fell from 9% to 4% (Figure 0.14).

Measuring progress towards parity is necessary 
but is not sufficient to assess gender equality. 
Such assessment requires systematic analysis 
of whether countries have been able to address 
discriminatory social norms (for example, through 
legislation), remove gender bias from inputs such 
as textbooks, improve education processes and 
tackle unsafe learning environments. Chapter 
5 looks at available evidence to assess whether 
schools and communities have successfully 
pursued the objective of gender equality.

These averages mask considerable diversity. The 
percentage of countries that achieved parity in 
both primary and secondary education increased 
from 21% in 1999 to 30% in 2012. Of the 155 
countries with three data points for primary 
education, 52% had already achieved parity in 
1999. By 2005, the original target deadline, the 
share had only increased to 57%, and in 2012 
it was still just 65%. Yet large disparities, with 
fewer than 80 girls for every 100 boys enrolled – 

If the gender gap in learning outcomes is used 
as a measure of progress towards gender 
equality, some evidence suggests the relative 
position of girls has been improving. The gap 
separating them from boys in mathematics and 
science has shrunk, although some caution is 
needed, as much of the more robust information 
over time comes from richer countries. On the 
other hand, the gap in favour of girls in language 
has increased (see Chapter 5).

The quest for an education of good quality cuts 
across the Dakar Framework and the other five 
goals. The framework expresses concern over 
emerging evidence that a sizeable percentage 
of children were ‘acquiring only a fraction of 
the knowledge and skills they are expected to 
master’ while ‘[w]hat students are meant to 
learn has often not been clearly defined, well-
taught or accurately assessed’ (UNESCO, 2000).

In 2000, the task of monitoring quality was 
only conceivable in terms of measuring inputs. 
Now, learning outcomes are considered key for 
reviewing whether quality has improved, though 
they should not be the only criterion. Increasingly, 
information has been made available on 
outcomes. Since 2000, countries’ interest in 
improving their understanding of education 
system outcomes has rapidly expanded. In the 
decade before Dakar, 34% of countries carried 
out at least one national learning assessment; 
between 2000 and 2013 the percentage grew 
to 69%. Particularly rapid improvement was 
observed in the Arab States, Central Asia, 
Central and Eastern Europe, and East Asia and 
the Pacific (Figure 0.15), a trend indicating active 
engagement by countries with the EFA agenda’s 
quality imperative (Benavot and Köseleci, 2015).

However, the increasing use of learning 
assessments has not yet been translated 
into sufficient information. While the 2013/4 

GMR noted that some 250 million children of 
primary school age were not reaching minimum 
learning standards in reading and mathematics, 
the world has not yet reached a stage where 
learning outcomes can be tracked over time and 
across a sizeable share of countries.

Among international and regional learning 
achievement surveys since 2000, the OECD 
Programme for International Student 
Assessment (PISA) has the largest coverage 
across countries and over time, enabling a 
systematic review of trends. Of 38 countries 
where the mean score in reading can be 
compared over 2000–2009, 13 improved while 
4 deteriorated. Also, 14 countries reduced the 
percentage falling below a minimum proficiency 
threshold, while in 7 the percentage increased 
(OECD, 2010b). Of 64 countries where the mean 
score in mathematics can be compared over 
2003–2012, performance was ‘broadly similar’ 
overall, though on balance more countries 
recorded improvement than deterioration 
(OECD, 2014g).

Assessments only report the learning outcomes 
of children who were in school, and thus 
overestimate the learning achievement of the 
relevant population. An interesting exception is 
citizen-led assessments, like those conducted in 
South Asia and Eastern Africa, which also assess 
learning levels among out-of-school children. 

Before Dakar, 
34% of countries 
carried out 
at least one 
national learning 
assessment;  
this has since 
grown to 69%

18

OVERVIEWEducation for All Global Monitoring Report1025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportAlthough they focus on a restricted set of 
outcomes, such assessments have become 
popular, since they enable local communities to 
hold their governments to account. This type of 
assessment is expanding to other countries.

The Dakar Framework clearly emphasized 
teachers and the elimination of gaps in teacher 
supply. In primary education, 1.4 million 
additional teachers were needed as of 2012 to 
achieve universal primary education by 2015 
while ensuring that all primary school age 
children were in classes with no more than 40 
pupils per teacher (UNESCO, 2014i). The global 
pupil/teacher ratio fell only slightly, from 26:1 
in 1999 to 24:1 in 2012. In sub-Saharan Africa 
it grew from 42:1 in 1999 to 45:1 in 2008 before 
falling back to 42:1 by 2012, still well above 
levels suitable for disadvantaged learners 
(Figure 0.16a).

In secondary education, the global pupil/teacher 
ratio fell from 18:1 to 17:1 between 1999 and 
2012. The largest decrease was in South and 
West Asia, from 32:1 to 25:1, suggesting that the 
region prioritized investment in teachers at the 
secondary more than the primary level, where 
the ratio stagnated at 35:1 (Figure 0.16b).

These ratios do not indicate teacher distribution 
within countries, and are silent on the quality 
of teachers and their professional training. 
Lacking a global consensus on a definition of

trained teachers, the available indicators refer 
to national definitions. In primary education, 
it is possible to compare progress among 50 
countries, where the average percentage of 
trained teachers increased from 77% to 90%, 
indicating that some progress has taken place.

The Dakar Framework identified a series of 
factors that contribute to education quality, 
ranging from facility conditions to participation 
in school management and from curricula to 
the language of instruction. Though systematic 
evidence is not available on global trends over 
time for many of these factors, Chapter 6 
examines available sources to identify messages 
emerging from the discourse on education 
quality over the past 15 years.

OVERVIEWWas progress faster after Dakar?

While the goals themselves may have been 
missed, progress needs to be fairly assessed 
in an additional way: by considering the pace of 
progress, and whether it accelerated after Dakar 
compared with the period immediately preceding 
it. This reveals whether the movement towards 
the progress embodied in the EFA goals gained 
momentum after 2000.

In terms of pace of progress, an analysis of 
growth rates in selected indicators comparing 
the periods 1990–1999 and 1999–2012 points to 
some improvement (Bruneforth, 2015). Progress 
accelerated in the pre-primary education gross 
enrolment ratio. Among the 90 countries with 
data, 63 were at least two years further ahead 
than if enrolments had continued to grow at the 
rate observed in the 1990s, and 21 countries 
were at least two years further behind. If 
enrolment had grown at the same rate as in the 
1990s, the global pre-primary enrolment ratio 
would have reached 40% by 2015; instead, it is 
expected to be 58%. In South and West Asia, 
depending on the reference period used, the pre-
primary gross enrolment ratio is projected to be 
either 61% or 66%; on pre-Dakar trends, it would 
have been 32%.

Evidence on progress towards universal primary 
education is less strong. Among the 52 countries 
with data on the primary net enrolment ratio, 26 
accelerated and 24 countries slowed compared 
with the rate observed in the 1990s. The 
slowdown was observed mainly in countries 
close to the target, with acceleration mainly 
in countries far from the target. If enrolment 
had grown at the rate of the 1990s, the global 
primary net enrolment ratio would have 
reached 82% by 2015; instead, it may reach up 
to 91%. The region that exceeded the previously 
projected trend by the most is sub-Saharan 
Africa, where, depending on the reference 
period used, the primary net enrolment ratio is 
expected to be either 80% or 84%; pre-Dakar 
trends would have put it at 67%.

Evidence from 70 countries on the survival rate 
to the last grade of primary school suggests 
that some enrolment gains were at the cost of 
slower progression. Only in 23 countries did 
the survival rate accelerate; in 37, it slowed. 
The global survival rate is projected to reach, 

at most, 76% by 2015, while at the 1990s rate 
it would have reached 80%. In South and West 
Asia, the survival rate is projected to be 64% 
by 2015; following pre-Dakar trends it would 
have reached 77%.

Progress towards gender parity appears to have 
accelerated in primary education, although 
parity would have been achieved at the global 
level even on pre-Dakar trends. Accelerated 
improvement made a particular difference in the 
Arab States and sub-Saharan Africa.

The world will be closer to key targets than if 
previous trends had continued

Past research shows that the expansion of 
education systems has a dynamic of its own 
(Meyer et al., 1977; Meyer et al., 1992). Once 
the children of a country begin enrolling in 
and completing school, schooling begins to 
diffuse across the population more broadly. 
This diffusion process occurs at a relatively 
similar pace across countries. A study early 
in the Dakar period maintained that, starting 
from the year in which a country managed to 
enrol half of its children in school, and applying 
the average global speed at which education 
systems expand, ‘we can predict roughly 90% 
of the variation in net primary enrolment in 
all countries for the entire post-war period’ 
(Clemens, 2004). 

Using this idea, new research for the GMR 
assumes that some progress in education 
would have been expected in the post-Dakar 
period (Lange, 2015). For two indicators – the 
percentage of children who have ever been to 
school and those who have attained primary 
education – the analysis used household data 
from 97 low and middle income countries to 
test the notion of EFA progress beyond what 
could have been expected. For both indicators, 
progress appears to have surpassed past trends, 
although the full effect of the Dakar period can 
be estimated only when all cohorts of children 
affected by changes since 2000 have gone 
through the education system.

The progress of the percentage of children 
who have ever been to school can be estimated 
with more confidence, since more cohorts 
of young children have been observed since 
2000. Developments since Dakar have led to 

In sub-Saharan 
Africa, the 
primary net 
enrolment 
ratio would 
have been 
much lower 
at pre-Dakar 
trends

20

OVERVIEWEducation for All Global Monitoring Report1025Education for All Global Monitoring Reportan increase of two percentage points in the 
proportion of children who will have had access 
to school for the first time in low and middle 
income countries. Overall, it is estimated that 34 
million more children born before 2010 will have 
had access to school for the first time by 2015, 
compared with what would have happened if the 
previous trend had persisted.

It is projected that by 2015, there will be an 
increase of fewer than two percentage points in 
the proportion of children who will have finished 
the primary education cycle, from 81% to 83%. 
Overall, it is estimated that 20 million more 
children born before 2005 will have completed 
primary school, compared with a projection 
based on pre-Dakar trends.

The claim made in the Dakar Framework that 
achieving EFA by 2015 was ‘a realistic and 
achievable goal’ may have been exaggerated, 
even if reduced to a narrow target such as 
universal primary education. Yet, while the global 
target itself was not reached, modest progress 
was achieved, which compares favourably to the 
historical record.

Explaining progress 
towards EFA: A favourable 
international context

The world has remained far from achieving all 
the EFA targets set in Dakar and wide inequality 
remains. Still, key targets are projected to be 
closer to being achieved in 2015 than if the 
pre-2000 trends had continued. This section 
looks at aspects of the general international 
context that might have influenced EFA progress. 
It concludes that sustained economic growth 
in low and middle income countries created a 
favourable environment that enabled some of 
them to allocate more resources to education 
and overcome continuing challenges due to 
demography or conflict in some of the world’s 
poorest countries.

Demography remained an obstacle in  
sub‑Saharan Africa

Demographic parameters can have a major 
impact on countries’ ability to achieve 
education targets. Both the relative size of the 
school age population and its geographical 
dispersion determine the cost of achieving 
universal schooling.

Over the past few years, sub-Saharan Africa has 
been on a different demographic path than the 
rest of the world. In absolute terms, compared 
with 1990, the cohort of children aged 5 to 14 
in sub-Saharan Africa had increased by 28% in 
2000 and by 65% in 2010. By contrast, in East 
Asia and the Pacific this cohort was 13% smaller 
in 2010 than in 1990 (Figure 0.17a).

In relative terms, the share of this cohort in 
the total population in sub-Saharan Africa not 
only remained the largest (at 27%) but was also 
constant between 1990 and 2010. By contrast, 
the cohort’s share declined from 27% to 21% in 
the Arab States and from 25% to 21% in South 
and West Asia. This suggests that all other 
regions faced decreasing pressure to deliver 
education services to their young generation 
(Figure 0.17b).

The total fertility rate declined globally from 
3 children in 1990–1995 to 2.5 children in 
2005–2010. In sub-Saharan Africa, despite a 
faster decline from 6.2 to 5.4 children over the 

20 million 
more children 
will have 
completed 
primary 
school than 
if past trends 
had continued

period, fertility remains high (UNPD, 2014a). As 
a result, the region also has the highest child 
dependency ratio, with 73 children under age 15 
per 100 persons of working age in 2015, close 
to double the global average (UNICEF, 2014b; 
UNPD, 2014a). Lower family size can be expected 
to result in increased household emphasis on 
education (Moav, 2005).

Increasing life expectancy has also been 
linked to higher levels of education attainment 
(Cervellati and Sunde, 2013; Cohen and Leker, 
2014; Jayachandran and Lleras-Muney, 2009). 
Life expectancy at birth in less developed 
countries increased by 2 years between 1990 and 
2000, but by 3.3 years between 2000 and 2010 
(UNPD, 2014a). This acceleration, the result of 
progress in controlling the AIDS epidemic and a

faster decline in child and maternal mortality, is 
likely to have increased demand for education.

Urbanization has accelerated globally since 
2000. The percentage of the total population 
living in urban areas increased from 43% in 1990 
to 47% in 2000 and 52% in 2010. This has largely 
been driven by rapid change in East Asia and the 
Pacific, where massive urbanization in China 
presented a major challenge to the education 
system (see Chapter 3) (Figure 0.18).

Education provision in urban areas tends to be 
less costly and more efficient, thus easier to 
expand. And despite problems of capacity in 
accommodating the influx of rural migrants to 
cities, who often move into unregulated slum 
areas, domestic migration facilitates access 
to public services. Analysis by the GMR team 
shows that even if primary attainment rates 
had remained constant in urban and rural 
areas in sub-Saharan Africa, the increase in the 
percentage of people living in high attainment 
urban areas would have been enough to raise 
the average primary attainment rate by 1.5 
percentage points between 2000 and 2010.

Domestic revenue mobilization increased in 
developing countries

Economic growth can be a powerful factor in 
education development, but only if governments 
are able and willing to mobilize resources and 
direct them to education.

Developing countries have returned to sustained 
growth and have outperformed advanced 
economies over the past 15 years (Figure 0.19a) 
(IMF, 2014). While Asia had enjoyed growth 
since at least the 1980s and real per capita 
growth rates reached high levels in the 2000s, 
the 1980s and 1990s were disastrous for other 
regions. The Arab States and Latin America 
and the Caribbean experienced negative real 
per capita growth rates in the 1980s (-0.4% and 
-0.8%, respectively) and very slow growth in the 
1990s. In Sub-Saharan Africa, which underwent 
a protracted period of structural adjustment 
programmes, the regional economy shrank by 
1.0% in the 1980s and 0.5% in the 1990s. But all 
three regions returned to growth of about 2.5% 
after 2000 (Sundaram et al., 2011).

Low and middle income countries increased 
government revenue as a share of GDP from 

OVERVIEWEducation for All Global Monitoring Report1025Education for All Global Monitoring Report23% in 2000 to 28% in 2012, accompanied 
by a commensurate increase in government 
expenditure as a share of GDP, from 25% to 
30% (Figure 0.19b). It is mainly this increase 
that helps explain the growth in education 
expenditure in developing countries in terms of 
GDP, as education did not receive a higher share 
of the budget over this period (see Chapter 8).

Extreme poverty rates fell but barriers to 
education remained

Economic growth can be a powerful factor in 
education development, provided it is sufficiently 
equitable to reduce poverty and raise household 
demand for education. In many countries, 
average prosperity has increased due to 
growing global demand for resources, energy 
and commodities. But such opportunities for 
wealth creation are not broad-based and may 
not benefit the poor if redistribution policies are 
lacking or not implemented.

Globally, the percentage of people in developing 
countries living on less than US$1.25 per day fell 
from 47% in 1990 to 22% in 2010. But economic 
growth has not led to the same degree of poverty 
reduction everywhere. While in East Asia and 
the Pacific, the share of those living in extreme 
poverty decreased from 45% in 1990 to 14% in 
2010, the decline in sub-Saharan Africa was far 
more modest, from 56% to 48%. There will still 
be a billion extremely poor people in the world in 
2015. One in eight people continue to suffer from 
chronic hunger (World Bank, 2014a).

Nevertheless, there have been improvements 
in global water and energy infrastructure that 
can have a direct impact on the education 
opportunities of the poorest. For example, 
children may be forced to spend less time 
fetching water or wood. The coverage of drinking 
water supply in the least developed countries 
increased gradually from 50% in 1990 to 67% 
in 2012 (UNICEF and WHO, 2014). The Energy 
Development Index showed notable improvement 
in access to electricity between 2002 and 2010 in 
East Asia and the Pacific and Latin America and 
the Caribbean, though far less in sub-Saharan 
Africa (International Energy Agency, 2012).

The global improvement in overall living conditions 
has also had an effect on children’s lives in other 
ways that also affect their education. The number 
of 5- to 17-year-olds in child labour declined by

OVERVIEWone-third, from 246 million in 2000 to 168 million 
in 2012, while the number of these children 
engaged in hazardous work was halved from 171 
million to 85 million (ILO, 2013b). Nevertheless, 
this remains a major, and unacceptable, problem.

Governments have increasingly emphasized 
social protection policies that can help 
vulnerable households overcome financial 
constraints on sending their children to school. 
Globally, public social protection and health 
care expenditure as a share of GDP increased 
from 5.8% in 1990 to 6.5% in 2000 and 8.6% 
in 2010 (ILO, 2014c). Middle income countries 
have expanded social protection systems since 
2000. In Latin America, cash transfer policies 
increased their coverage of the population from 
5.7% in 2000 to 19.3% in 2010 (ECLAC, 2010). 
Fewer low income countries have succeeded in 
introducing similar programmes, however, as 
governments face multiple challenges, including 
widespread poverty and weak capacity for 
implementation of complex policies (Andrews  
et al., 2012) (see Chapter 2).

Gender discrimination continues

Attempts to increase access to school for girls 
will be thwarted if social institutions, norms 
and practices continue to be discriminatory. 
This was the point of gender mainstreaming 
efforts, building on the Convention on the 
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination 
Against Women (1979) and the fourth World 
Conference on Women in Beijing (1995), to 
make ‘women’s as well as men’s concerns and 
experiences an integral dimension of the design, 
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of 
policies and programmes’ to achieve gender 
equality (United Nations, 1997).

Globally, the female labour force participation 
rate, a potential barometer of empowerment, 
remained constant between 1990 and 2010 
at about 52%. However, this masks regional 
differences. Participation increased in the 
Arab States of northern Africa and, particularly, 
in Latin America and the Caribbean. By contrast, 
it decreased in Central Asia and in East Asia 
(Elborgh-Woytek et al., 2013; UNSD, 2010). A 
review of 64 studies showed that gender wage 
gaps persisted, though varying widely across 
regions. Women earned 10% less than men 
in East Asia but 48% less in South Asia (Ñopo 

et al., 2011). While the gap is partly linked 
with the fact that more women work in low 
paying occupations, a large part is the result of 
discrimination (OECD, 2012c).

Another marker of progress is political 
representation by women: it remains very low, 
though some important improvements have 
occurred. The share of parliament seats held 
by women increased from 14% in 2000 to 22% 
in 2014, ranging from 3% in the Pacific to 26% 
in Latin America and the Caribbean. But the 
percentage of women in ministerial posts was 
17% in 2014 and women are even less likely to 
be heads of government, parliament or state 
(United Nations, 2014a). A weak presence of 
women in the economic and political life of a 
nation sends the wrong signal regarding girls’ 
educational opportunities.

Some progress for girls and women has been 
measured. The OECD Social Institutions and 
Gender Index, launched in 2009, monitors 
discriminatory social institutions and practices, 
ranging from unequal inheritance rights to 
restrictions on access to public space. It has 
captured signs of improvement (OECD, 2012a). 
However, the prevalence of early marriage and 
domestic violence remains unacceptably high 
(see Chapter 5).

Aid increased in absolute but not in 
relative terms

Various efforts were made in the 1990s to bring 
development to the top of the international 
agenda. These included major international 
conferences sponsored by the United Nations 
in fields ranging from education to environment 
and population, a campaign urging for debt 
relief, and a push by organizations like the OECD 
for a coherent set of development objectives 
(Hulme, 2009). These processes culminated 
in 2000 with the Millennium Summit and the 
Millennium Declaration, which put forward a 
global commitment to address key development 
challenges within a common framework, which 
in September 2001 led to the eight Millennium 
Development Goals.

The eighth MDG, on developing a global 
development partnership, focused on aid and 
debt. Improving aid and relieving debt can 
have a direct effect on education. In 2001, aid

income (GNI) of OECD Development Assistance 
Committee (DAC) member states, from 0.33% in 
1992. The Monterrey International Conference 
on Financing for Development in 2002 led to 
a commitment to increase assistance, which 
had bounced back to 0.30% of GNI by 2013 
but remained well below a target set by some 
countries to allocate 0.70% (Figure 0.20a). In 
real absolute terms, total aid volume almost 
doubled from a low in 1997 of US$71 billion to 
US$135 billion in 2013 (Figure 0.20b).

Between 2001–2002 and 2011–2012, the share 
of total aid going to the least developed and low 
income countries increased from 40% to 51% 
(OECD, 2014c). However, while the overall share 
of aid to social sectors increased in the 2000s, 
the share allocated to education fell from 10.2% 
in the 1990s to 8% in the 2000s (Figure 0.20c).

In terms of debt relief, international financial 
institutions had already launched the Highly 
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative in 1996 
to reduce the external debt of 39 countries to 
sustainable levels. This was followed in 2005 
by the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), 
which has allowed the 36 countries that have 
‘graduated’ from the HIPC Initiative process to 
get access to 100% relief on eligible debt held by 
the IMF, World Bank and African Development 
Fund. Overall, participating countries have had 
future debt payments reduced by US$57.3 billion 
(in end-2012 net present value terms) (United 
Nations, 2014c).

Debt relief through the HIPC Initiative and MDRI 
led, along with better debt management and 
more trade, to a reduction in the debt service-to-
exports ratio of developing countries from 12% 
in 2000 to 3% in 2012 (United Nations, 2014c). 
Expenditure on health and education increased 
in HIPC countries (Prizzon and Mustapha, 
2014). However, these developments cannot be 
clearly disentangled from the influence of other 
factors, such as growth in domestic resource 
mobilization for education.

OVERVIEWExplaining progress towards 
EFA: Assessing the role of 
the EFA movement at the 
global level

With these key demographic, economic and 
social developments in perspective, one can 
turn to other key questions: In what ways did 
the pledges made at Dakar help achieve the EFA 
goals? Did EFA partners fulfil the pledges? To 
the extent that they did so, to what degree did 
this contribute to progress towards EFA after 
2000? This section focuses on the actions of 
EFA partners at the global level. As more robust 
evaluation is not possible in the absence of 
extensive literature, the section offers an initial 
balance sheet as a basis for reflection. Analysis 
of goal-specific actions at the national level is 
found in the chapters that follow.

Evidence suggests that global pledges made 
in the Dakar Framework were only partially 
fulfilled. The required scope of interventions 
may have exceeded the capacity of EFA partner 
organizations to significantly influence change at 
the national level. However, some of the envisaged 
mechanisms worked well, advancing the state of 
education from 2000. This is a source of optimism 
for a post-2015 global education framework.

The World Education Forum renewed 
commitment to EFA

To understand the Dakar goals and strategies, 
some context is necessary. The 1990 Jomtien 
World Conference on Education for All ushered 
in a new era of international cooperation in 
education. The realization that schooling rates 
were stagnant in many parts of the world, the 
belief that human development should be at 
the core of all development, and the optimism 
generated by the end of the Cold War led to an 
ambitious call to support EFA. The ‘expanded 
vision’ of Jomtien’s World Declaration on 
Education for All succinctly expressed policy 
concerns on issues such as equity, learning and 
non-formal education provision which are valid 
to this day (Inter-Agency Commission, 1990; 
Unterhalter, 2014).

Nevertheless, progress remained sluggish 
during the 1990s. The forces that had led to 

stagnation, especially those related to structural 
adjustment policies in the poorest countries, 
were still exerting their influence (Hallak, 1991). 
Key indicators relating to participation in pre-
primary and primary education barely improved, 
as the first part of this chapter showed. The 
Mid-Decade Meeting in Amman in 1996 revealed 
not only a lack of progress but also insufficient 
follow-up on the main actions agreed (Little and 
Miller, 2000).

By the late 1990s, there was a sense that the 
EFA agenda urgently needed putting back 
on track, as two developments in particular 
indicate. First, the International Consultative 
Forum, the inter-agency body responsible for 
EFA monitoring, advocacy and partnerships, set 
forth an ambitious process of national end-of-
decade EFA assessments, with support from 
its Paris-based secretariat. With 180 countries 
participating in the process, a robust global 
update became available, which re-emphasized 
that EFA was a universal agenda; the process 
also helped build capacity in many countries that 
had not previously done a similar exercise. The 
results of the assessment were combined into 
a global synthesis and a statistical document 
(Skilbeck, 2000; UIS, 2000).

Second, frustration with the slow pace of 
progress increased external pressure on the 
international community to act. Civil society 
organizations raised their voice and lobbied 
strongly to be heard through an existing 
mechanism, the Collective Consultation of 
NGOs on Literacy and EFA, but also, notably, 
through new channels. International NGOs, in 
particular, set up campaigns demanding that 
donors increase aid. Eventually, ActionAid, Oxfam 
International and Education International joined 
with the Global March Against Child Labour to 
establish the Global Campaign for Education in 
October 1999 to ‘mobilise public pressure on 
governments to fulfil their promises to provide 
free, quality education for all people, particularly 
for women’ (Culey et al., 2007).

As a result, the World Education Forum took 
place in April 2000 in Dakar with a clearer 
sense of the state of education and under more 
scrutiny. The Dakar Framework for Action, not 
only re-affirmed the  EFA goals and vision, but 
went a step further to better define the roles and 
mechanisms at the various levels (Torres, 2001).

OVERVIEWEducation for All Global Monitoring Report1025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportWhat global processes did Dakar set in 
motion to bring about change?

The theory behind influencing national 
EFA policy

The Dakar Framework intended to bring 
positive change to global education through 
various mechanisms and processes, stating: 
‘The functions of these [national, regional and 
international] mechanisms will include, to 
varying degrees, advocacy, resource mobilization, 
monitoring, and EFA knowledge generation 
and sharing.’

But while the framework set principles, it also 
left many of its assumptions unwritten. To now 
assess the Dakar Framework’s chances to 
succeed, it is necessary to spell out more clearly 
the relationships aimed at translating a global 
conference into change on the ground. 

The Dakar Framework stated that the ‘heart of 
EFA activity lies at the country level’ yet called 
for donor action, as there was ‘already evidence 
from many countries of what can be achieved 
through strong national strategies supported 
by effective development co-operation. 
Progress under these strategies could – and 
must – be accelerated through increased 
international support.’

For this purpose, then, the partners committed 
to ‘strengthen accountable international and 
regional mechanisms to give clear expression 
to these commitments and to ensure that the 
Dakar Framework for Action is on the agenda 
of every international and regional organization, 
every national legislature and every local 
decision-making forum.’

This section maps and classifies the 
framework’s proposed activities, analyses 
the rationale and assumptions behind them 
and describes how the EFA movement was 
expected to deliver change. Three types of 
global interventions were proposed to support 
countries (Figure 0.21):

 ■ Coordination mechanisms, some of which 
already existed. Others were outlined for 
the first time in the Dakar Framework and 
subsequently modified.

 ■ Campaigns, dedicated to particular aspects 
of EFA, such as adult literacy, or to particular 
challenges, such as conflict.

 ■ Initiatives, some which were specified in 

the Dakar Framework. Others were created 
subsequently, drawing from its authority.

These interventions overlapped and interacted 
with one another but had individual organizational 
and management arrangements. It was hoped 
that, if successfully implemented, they would 
lead to short- to medium-term results which 
in turn would help speed up achievement of 
the EFA goals.

The first expected result was that these 
interventions would help reaffirm and sustain 
political commitment to EFA. While the Dakar 
Framework was not legally binding, it would 
confer international legitimacy to efforts to 
achieve the goals. This would provide sufficient 
support to stakeholders at the national level 
to push for necessary reforms and convince 
reluctant governments. Campaigns would 
keep EFA on top of the civil society agenda. 
EFA-wide or theme-specific initiatives would 
provide expertise to maintain momentum on 
key challenges.

But the main push would be provided by 
effective EFA coordination mechanisms, 
notably those involving the five EFA convening 
agencies: UNESCO, UNICEF, the United Nations 
Population Fund (UNFPA), the United Nations 
Development Programme (UNDP) and the 
World Bank. These mechanisms would ensure 
regular oversight and would also provide 
accountability: countries would be aware that 
they were observed and that their actions 
risked being found lacking, raising questions at 
home and abroad.

The interventions were based on three 
implicit assumptions. First, there would 
be no competition with other agendas. In 
practice, though, the MDGs, which became 
the dominant development narrative, have 
diluted the EFA message and narrowed its 
focus. Second, the EFA convening agencies 
would collaborate effectively at the central and 
country levels. In practice, this did not happen. 
Political will to do so was weak, resources for 
coordination were limited and agencies had

other competing priorities. Third, EFA convening 
agencies would have the most authoritative voice 
in international education. But over time, new 
voices, such as that of the OECD, increasingly 
appealed to countries where the EFA agenda may 
have had less resonance (Bolívar, 2011; Sellar 
and Lingard, 2013).

The second expected result was that EFA 
mechanisms, initiatives and campaigns would 
help diverse types of knowledge, evidence and 
expertise be communicated and used. As the 
2000 EFA assessment revealed, a lot could be 
learned from exchanges between EFA partners 
and the sharing of good practices. The Dakar 
interventions could facilitate such learning 
while also opening up a platform for other 
views, notably those from the grass-roots or 
outside the mainstream. NGOs would come to 
be seen as key partners, especially in reaching 
the marginalized, and as a source of innovation 
and knowledge.

The implicit assumption here was that policy-
making was a technical exercise informed by 
evidence. While the concepts of evidence-based 
policies and results-based management did gain 
currency over the period, there also was growing 
realization of the role of politics (Grindle, 2004). 
Lack of action by national governments did 
not just reflect lack of information. In practice, 
even countries committed to EFA goals would 
require political support to build the national 
capacity to seek, absorb, interpret and apply 
external findings.

The third expected result was that various 
interventions would influence and strengthen 
national EFA policy and practice. A call for all 
countries to develop plans of action that would 
‘give substance and form to the goals and 
strategies set out in this Framework’ aimed to 
align global and national priorities in an effective 
and timely manner. The international community 
pledged to support the preparation of plans for

as complex crises or natural disasters’, and, 
critically, to ‘work in a consistent, co-ordinated 
and coherent manner’ to support these plans.

An implicit assumption was that countries could 
switch to an EFA plan of action without friction. 
In practice, many countries already had their 
own national mechanisms and planning cycles 
and their own stakeholders to consult with. They 
differed widely in how action plans were used 
for educational development. In some cases, 
the insistence on a separate plan outside the 
national process of planning and budgeting may 
have been counterproductive.

The fourth expected result was that financial 
resources for EFA would be effectively 
mobilized. The Dakar signatories believed that 
developing countries’ efforts to raise more tax 
and prioritize basic education in their budgets 
would be insufficient to achieve EFA. It was 
estimated in the Dakar Framework that the 
additional financial support needed to achieve 
EFA was about $US8 billion annually.

The implicit assumption was that many 
countries were spending way below what would 
be needed to ensure universal access and the 
provision of good quality education, and that aid 
would be needed to make up the difference. In 
practice, the capacity of countries’ financial and 
education systems to absorb rapid increases 
in external aid flows was not considered. 
Neither was the ability of countries to spend 
effectively. It was further assumed that, in a 
period of strong donor coordination and calls 
for debt relief, no significant shocks would 
affect aid disbursements – that the appeal to 
donors to essentially more than triple aid to 
basic education was ambitious but achievable. 
But financial crisis in donor countries later 
dampened these expectations.

The fifth expected result was the establishment 
of independent monitoring and reporting of 
progress towards the EFA goals. Regular and 
frequent reporting would draw attention to those 
countries or partners not fulfilling their pledges 
and enhance accountability. Results from 
monitoring activities would influence policy.

However, declarations are not legally binding and 
governments often choose not to adopt global 
targets as national targets. National processes 

may be considered more important and the 
degree of external influence limited (Box 0.2). 
Even if countries agree to global targets, 
monitoring can help accelerate progress only if 
there is a formal mechanism for accountability 
to note countries’ underperformance. None 
exists. Moreover, a globally oriented monitoring 
mechanism (like the GMR) does not necessarily 
provide clear and convincing advice to individual 
countries as to the best direction for education 
policy reform.

The scope for 
global EFA 
architecture 
to influence 
national EFA 
policy increased 
since 2000

Box 0.2. The potential of international  
actors to influence national education policy

The Dakar Framework assumes that global action can 
directly influence national systems, even though external 
factors are only one influence, and likely not the most 
important. Views differ: is a system of global governance 
of education at work, with powerful state and non-state 
actors, or does country participation in global mechanisms 
have few implications for national policy change?

Even in countries of the European Union, where a process 
for structured policy dialogue exists in the form of the 
voluntary ‘open method of coordination’, education policy 
remains strictly a national preserve that treaties leave 
to the discretion of member states. The exception to 
this is technical vocational education and the ‘European 
dimension’ in which regional policy directives trump 
national ones. In general, though, countries may be 
influenced by other actors, but it is difficult to say if such 
influence is implicitly imposed or willingly adopted. In the 
case of loose coordination mechanisms, such as those of 
EFA, it is even more difficult to trace the subtle channels 
through which national policies adjust to proposed 
global norms.

However, globalization has increased the potential in 
recent years for global and regional actions to influence 
national education processes. In the richer countries, 
the OECD has had a growing role in national curricula as 
part of peer reviews and sharing of lessons learned, with 
a stronger influence on policy since the introduction of 
PISA. In poorer countries, receiving an education sector 
loan from a development bank entailed conditions such 
as ceilings on teacher salaries that reduced the degree of 
freedom in policy-making. Similarly, as aid programmes 
increased in volume and as aid agencies coordinated with 
one another and strengthened their negotiating position, 
countries may have endorsed policies that reflected donor 
preferences, in spite of the principle of national ownership.

Overall, it does appear that the scope for global 
EFA architecture to influence national EFA policy 
has increased since 2000, strengthening one of the 
underlying assumptions of the Dakar Framework.

OVERVIEWThe practice of influencing national EFA policy: 
the Dakar strategies

In order to assess whether the proposed 
interventions were sufficient, it is necessary  
to consider whether they were implemented  
as planned. 

This section assesses the collective performance 
of EFA partners at the global level vis-à-vis the 
Dakar Framework’s 12 strategies (Box 0.1) in 
relation to the 5 expected results described 
above. The goal-specific chapters address in 
more detail how countries took up the strategies.

Strategy 1: Significant investment in basic education

Two developments characterize progress 
towards financing basic education, especially 
in the countries that were the furthest from the 
EFA goals and in the greatest need of support. 
First, low and lower middle income countries 
have allocated a higher percentage of GNP to 
education since 1999, although mainly more 
as a result of increased domestic resource 
mobilization than because of higher priority on 
education in budgets (see Chapter 8).

Second, aid to education more than doubled in 
real terms, although donors did not contribute 
equally to the effort. The Dakar Framework 
urged funding agencies to allocate ‘a larger 
share of their resources to support primary and 
other forms of basic education.’ Aid allocations 
as a share of high income countries’ GNI  
have increased since 2000, though they have 
not reached the levels of the 1980s. But the 
shares of education and of basic education in 
total aid portfolios fell slightly. Aid declined as a 
share of total education spending in low income 
countries, as their economies grew at a  
relatively faster rate (see Chapter 8).

The important questions are whether EFA 
interventions at the global level led to higher 
public education expenditure and aid to 
education levels at the national level, and 
whether EFA mechanisms affected other 
aid-related objectives set out in the Dakar 
Framework, such as to make ‘longer-term 
and more predictable commitments’, to be 
‘more accountable and transparent’ and to 
ensure ‘regular reporting at regional and 
international levels.’

While the actual contributions of individual 
donors should be a major factor in assessing 
the success of this strategy, the focus here 
is on the EFA Fast Track Initiative (FTI), later 
renamed the Global Partnership for Education 
(GPE), as evidence of their commitment. Such 
a mechanism was envisaged in the Dakar 
Framework and its creation reflected the 
aspirations of the international community 
for a coherent means of supporting countries 
committed to achieving EFA.

The establishment of the FTI is an example of 
how independent initiatives emerged outside 
the formal global coordination of the High-Level 
Group on Education for All. The first attempts 
to launch a global initiative failed. Frustration 
led the Netherlands and other bilateral donors 
to ask the World Bank to play a stronger role. 
This resulted in an action plan in 2002 and a 
framework document in 2004. A key feature of 
the initiative was that it did not originally operate 
as a fund but instead placed the responsibility on 
donors to align their support behind endorsed 
education sector plans.

FTI operations in the 2000s were plagued by 
criticism: of its operational dependence on  
the World Bank; of its limited focus on primary 
education at the expense of other EFA goals; and 
of its exclusion of some countries in great need 
because they were fragile and conflict-affected 
or because they were unable to produce a solid 
plan (Cambridge Education et al., 2010). In line 
with the conclusions of a midterm evaluation, 
the FTI was transformed into the GPE to build a 
stronger and more balanced partnership among 
agencies and improve the fund’s capacity to 
respond to country needs. This was indicated 
by a reformulation of its goals and objectives 
(Box 0.3), a theory of change, and important 
reforms in its governance and operational 
procedures. Gradually, the GPE has played a 
larger role. In the 39 countries which received 
programme implementation grants over 2004–12, 
the share of GPE in total aid disbursement to 
basic education increased from 4% in 2004–06 
to 16% in 2010–12, according to GMR team 
calculations. Donors have responded to two GPE 
Fund replenishment appeals, even if the result 
was below the ambitious targets.

The key question remains whether the GPE had 
a catalytic effect on the commitments that low

evidence is meagre. During the early period of 
the FTI, the ability to influence country processes 
was very limited. It increased after 2010 with the 
strengthening of the GPE Secretariat. However, 
the monitoring and reporting processes do not 
yet generate sufficient information to link GPE 
action to higher government spending.

Two fallacies that have shaped GPE reporting 
are at least partly a result of donor demand for 
short-term results and evidence of quick wins. 
First, the FTI/GPE has tried to attribute progress 
in outcomes, such as enrolment rates, to its 
disbursements, even though the chain of events 
that lead from one to the other is much more 
complex, especially given that GPE has often been 
a minor partner. Second, the GPE has claimed 

‘increased’ government pledges to its 2014 
replenishment round on the basis of very weak 
evidence. To authentically measure success, 
the GPE needs to be far more meticulous in 
documenting steps taken to obtain stronger 
commitments from donors and governments to 
finance education. The latest monitoring report 
offers some promise that both concerns are 
beginning to be addressed (GPE, 2014c).

Even though its focus was almost exclusively 
on the second EFA goal, the establishment 
of the FTI/GPE was an innovation in line with 
the aims of the Dakar Framework to mobilize 
financial resources from a range of sources. This 
development must be attributed to the actions 
of EFA partners at the global level and should be 
considered a success.

The key question 
remains whether 
the GPE had a 
catalytic effect 
on financing 
education

OVERVIEWStrategy 2: EFA policies within well-integrated 
sector frameworks linked to poverty elimination

The Dakar Framework specified that national 
EFA plans were to be the main tool for turning 
commitment into action, and indicated that these 
plans should be prepared by 2002. The role of 
EFA partners at the global and regional levels in 
that process was twofold.

First, the international community provided 
a framework for the preparation of an 
overall development strategy, the poverty 
reduction strategy papers (PRSP), that were 
complementary to national education plans. 
In the late 1990s, as debt relief efforts were 
gaining traction, the World Bank and the IMF 
required countries to confirm their commitment 
to poverty reduction and increased social sector 
spending by drawing up PRSPs. This process 
generated huge interest across the entire 
development community and brought together 
national and international stakeholders in 
the early 2000s.

Research at the time was favourable to the idea 
of education fitting into this framework, even 
though PRSP and EFA action plan processes 
often ran in parallel (Caillods and Hallak, 2004). 
However, interest waned towards the end of the 
decade, once joint staff reviews of the PRSP 
ceased being a requirement for concessional 
World Bank and IMF lending. No study has 
attempted to assess how the PRSP initiative 
affected the credibility of education plans.

Second, EFA partners were urged to assist 
countries that lacked capacity to prepare EFA 
action plans. Several agencies responded 
to this call by providing support to national 
governments, including efforts to prepare 
plans for the GPE (UNESCO-IIEP and GPE, 
2012). UNESCO spearheaded capacity-building 
efforts through the International Institute for 
Educational Planning, the Capacity Development 
for EFA Programme and tools such as 
simulation models and result-based planning 
handbooks (UNESCO, 2005b, 2006d). A multi-
agency initiative recently produced the updated 
‘Education Sector Analysis: Methodological 
Guidelines’, based on the experience of over 
20 years of working on Country Status Reports 
(UNESCO-IIEP et al., 2014).

An early evaluation of UNESCO support to 
national planning found that technical support 
was of good quality. However, it raised questions 
about the targeting of support and going beyond 
training personnel to longer term organisational 
capacity-building (UNESCO, 2006c). A subsequent 
evaluation of support on sector-wide policy and 
planning found that country-level initiatives 
strengthened institutions and brought ‘significant 
policy change and reform at national level’, but 
that projects tended to be too small to effect 
change on a larger scale (UNESCO, 2009b).

A broader question is whether the emphasis of 
the Dakar Framework on national plans helped 
improve their focus on EFA and their quality. 
A comparison of two waves of national plans 
(around 2000 and after 2000) from 30 low and 
middle income countries, carried out for this 
GMR, looked at their objectives, monitoring 
and financing arrangements to assess whether 
the formulation of plans improved over time 
(UNESCO-IIEP, 2015).

The objectives of universal primary education 
and quality were present in both waves. In 
general, the second generation of plans aligned 
objectives more to the EFA agenda. Yet there 
were differences across goals and across 
country income groups. References to the adult 
literacy goal did not increase. References to 
the goal of gender parity and equality increased 
over time, but gender was still not included in 
one-third of the second wave plans. Overall, the 
EFA agenda was more popular in low income 
than in middle income countries, although 
references to EFA goals increased in both groups 
over the period.

The use of monitoring frameworks clearly 
increased. Between the two waves, the share 
of country plans containing a monitoring 
framework increased from 23% to 73%, with 
improvement stronger in low and lower middle 
income countries. Before Dakar, three-quarters 
of all plans had either an irrelevant monitoring 
framework (with less than half the objectives 
covered by indicators) or none at all. After 
Dakar, this was the case for just one-quarter of 
plans. In two-thirds of countries, the framework 
and objectives were in complete concordance. 
Learning outcome indicators were present 
in only one in three plans before Dakar but 
afterward appeared in almost three in four.

Overall, the 
EFA agenda 
was more 
popular in low 
income than in 
middle income 
countries

32

OVERVIEWEducation for All Global Monitoring Report1025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportMonitoring of inequality is important. Plans 
that disaggregated indicators by sex became 
more prevalent, even if disaggregated targets 
were not systematically included. But very few 
plans disaggregated data by any other individual 
characteristics, such as socio-economic status, 
ethnicity or location.

Finally, with respect to financing frameworks, 
more than two-thirds of plans contained a cost 
framework in the post-Dakar period. However, 
these were mainly from low and lower middle 
income countries, which tend to need external 
assistance. Only one of the seven upper middle 
income countries had a cost framework for the 
most recent plan. The number of countries with 
a financing scenario increased over the period, 
as did the quality of the cost frameworks, if 
only slightly.

Overall, there are signs that the quality of 
national education plans improved over 
the period, although this assessment is 
limited to plans’ technical features and not 
implementation. Plans that look good on paper 
may have been drafted with strong support by 
donor agencies but bear limited relationship 
to countries’ political processes and education 
system realities.

Strategy 3: Engagement of civil society in strategies 
for educational development

The Dakar Framework encouraged the active 
participation of civil society in the formulation, 
implementation and monitoring of national 
development strategies and national EFA plans. 
In so doing it recognized the lack of openness in 
the EFA process before Dakar but also the role 
of civil society in maintaining EFA on top of the 
global development agenda.

EFA partners could promote the engagement 
of civil society in two ways. First, international 
organizations and government authorities could 
include civil society in policy-making processes. 
Two examples of formal representation of civil 
society stand out. UNESCO used the Collective 
Consultation of NGOs as its key mechanism for 
dialogue and partnerships and to help organize 
the selection of civil society representation 
in EFA coordination bodies. The GPE has 
reserved 3 of the 19 seats on its board for civil 
society organizations.

Second, global support could help civil society 
form and sustain national education coalitions. 
Such coalitions emerged in about 100 countries, 
although the impetus often came from 
international NGOs, with funding from donors. 
This raised questions on whether donors unduly 
determined coalitions’ agenda and created 
conditions of dependency. In addition, there 
were more delicate questions related to the 
role some coalitions had in determining which 
organizations received funding (CEF, 2007, 
2013). Coalitions were often more successful in 
countries where they did not rely on aid.

Nationally appropriate mechanisms have been 
used as alternatives to avoid the problems of 
incentives. The GPE financed a Civil Society 
Education Fund (CSEF), implemented by the 
Global Campaign for Education between 2009 
and 2012. It strengthened the capacity of civil 
society in 45 countries for developing education 
sector programmes, carrying out advocacy 
activities and tracking government and donor 
progress in working towards the EFA goals. 
An evaluation found that its activities helped 
coalitions achieve political recognition but were 
less effective in building capacity for research 
and knowledge management (GPE, 2012b). 
A second phase, aiming to address these 
criticisms, began in 2013 in 54 countries.

The main question was whether governments 
would give civil society a seat at the table and a 
say in processes. National education coalitions 
in 35 out of 42 countries funded by the GPE 
reported being engaged with the government 
and donor coordination group (Global Campaign 
for Education, 2014a). However, by some 
accounts the role of civil society in policy or 
monitoring remained limited. Governments 
sometimes excluded important civil society 
organizations. The role of civil society in 
positions of substantial influence, such as in 
relation to parliamentary standing committees 
on education, had not been formalized (Mundy 
et al., 2010). In some cases, civil society was 
equated with NGOs and did not sufficiently 
include such key education stakeholders as 
teacher unions and parent associations.

Overall, an increase in civil society activity has 
undoubtedly been a major achievement of the 
education landscape since 2000. International 
EFA partners have demonstrated a genuine

OVERVIEWcommitment to fulfil the relevant pledge made in 
Dakar. This support, however, has had only limited 
success in creating strong national education 
coalitions capable of effecting significant change. 
Some observers maintain that such an outcome 
is prevented by the political situation in many 
countries, where decisions are made based on 
gathering political support or on allegiance to 
ethnic or other identities (Devarajan et al., 2011).

Strategy 4: Accountability in governance 
and management

Support to civil society was a means to the  
more general objective of the Dakar Framework 
to improve the ‘governance of education 
systems in terms of efficiency, accountability, 
transparency and flexibility so that they can 
respond more effectively to the diverse and 
continuously changing needs of learners.’ 
EFA partners at the global level tried actively 
to promote local engagement and responsive 
service delivery, and to encourage countries to 
introduce broad public sector reform.

Local participation and empowerment, and 
decentralization, were considered key strategies 
for improving accountability. The World Bank 
in particular played an active role in advocating 
decentralization, notably through its 2004 

World Development Report, emphasizing it as 
a route to accountability (World Bank, 2004). 
Work carried out under the Systems Approach 
for Better Education Results initiative aimed to 
shed light on differences across countries in 
school autonomy as a factor explaining student 
performance. Policy experiments on providing 
information to empower citizens were used 
to demonstrate conditions under which such 
interventions work (Bruns et al., 2011).

Several EFA partners invested in capacity-
building programmes to complement 
decentralization and help local education 
officers, school leaders or community 
organizations benefit from their new authority. 
Democratic governance is a core pillar 
of the work of the UNDP, one of the EFA 
convening agencies, albeit not with an explicit 
education focus.

However, palpable results have been slow 
in coming, and long-term impact requires 
continuity, persistence and resources that 
exceed agency planning horizons (OECD, 
2004). Moreover, the level of expertise agencies 
require to follow such reforms is considerable 
(European Commission, 2012). Thus such 
interventions’ sustainability is in question 
(UNDP, 2010).

education and making schools responsive 
to the needs of the students, parents and 
communities they serve remain challenging 
issues, particularly for poor households 
with limited time for such engagement. 
Whether such results are best served 
through decentralization remains contested. 
Decentralization and school autonomy have 
been found to have either no impact or a 
detrimental one on student and system 
performance in poorer countries with weaker 
capacity (Chaudhary et al., 2012; Gallego, 2010; 
Hanushek et al., 2013). Experiments have also 
cast doubt ‘on the current faith in participation 
as a panacea for the problems of service 
delivery’, either because citizen capacity to 
respond to information is limited or because the 
balance of power in local education is not open 
to civil society influence (Banerjee et al., 2010) 
(see Chapter 6).

Strategy 5: Meeting the needs of education systems 
affected by conflict and instability

The ambition of this strategy was to build 
government capacity to assess educational 
needs in conflict situations, to restore 
learning opportunities in secure and friendly 
environments and to reconstruct damaged 
education systems. The 2011 GMR documented 
several actions taken since 2000 to fulfil this 
pledge at the global level.

First, violations of human rights in conflict 
situations are being followed more closely. The 
United Nations Security Council established a 
monitoring and reporting mechanism in 2007 
to document and report abuses of children’s 
rights, including attacks on schools. The Council 
authorized the Secretary-General in 2009 to 
publish the names of those who recruit child 
soldiers. However, violations are still under-
reported, enforcement mechanisms remain 
weak and education-specific issues, including 
sexual violence, are not covered adequately.

Second, humanitarian aid has been used more 
to support education systems in conflict zones 
and after natural disasters than for longer-
term humanitarian crises. The Inter-Agency 
Standing Committee Cluster for Education 
in Emergencies was established in 2005 as 
part of a broader reform of humanitarian aid. 

Co-led by UNICEF and Save the Children, the 
global education cluster supports country 
cluster operations, builds response capacity 
and implements standards to ensure that 
education is provided efficiently and equitably 
during crises. The cluster has helped raise 
the visibility of education and ensured that it 
was part of the wider humanitarian response 
in some cases (Steets et al., 2010). However, 
the increase in humanitarian aid for education 
has been limited (see Chapter 8). Attempts to 
build a bridge from humanitarian to long-term 
development assistance for education have thus 
far been unsuccessful.

Third, advocacy activities have helped maintain 
the place of conflict and emergency on the 
education agenda (see Chapter 2). The Inter-
Agency Network for Education in Emergencies is 
a major initiative that traces its establishment to 
Dakar. Despite its informal arrangements, it has 
played an important coordination role, notably 
through its Minimum Standards for Education 
in Emergencies. The Global Coalition to Protect 
Education from Attack was established in 
2010 to highlight the incidence and impact of 
attacks and to fight impunity. Its global report, 
which followed on earlier reports published by 
UNESCO, has shed light on failures to respect 
and protect schools as sanctuaries and zones of 
peace, which was a Dakar commitment (GCPEA, 
2014; UNESCO, 2010c).

Overall, compared with the strategy’s ambitious 
aims, progress may appear limited. However, 
the challenges of delivering education in 
emergencies have received far more attention 
since 2000 and have helped generate lessons on 
how to respond quickly and effectively. This can 
be credited to partners fulfilling commitments 
made in Dakar.

Strategy 6: Integrated strategies for gender equality

The most visible of all global mechanisms 
associated with gender equality has been 
the United Nations Girls’ Education Initiative 
(UNGEI), a multistakeholder partnership 
established in Dakar in 2000. Its activities 
have included advocacy to raise awareness 
of the importance of girls’ education and to 
influence policies and education sector plans; 
identification and dissemination of good 
practices; and institutional development of the

OVERVIEWpartnership approach at the global, regional and 
country levels.

An evaluation of UNGEI particularly 
acknowledged its contribution in global policy 
dialogue and advocacy, but less so at the 
regional level. At the country level, UNGEI 
has positioned itself as a valuable and strong 
player where robust national partnerships 
exist. Recognizing the challenge of translating 
globally agreed priorities into country-level 
activities, UNGEI has created stronger links with 
the GPE. The evaluation also praised UNGEI’s 
role in coordination and priority-setting among 
its members. However, more could be done 
to build capacity in national partnerships by 
strengthening in-country training and promoting 
exchanges between partnerships to share 
experiences (UNGEI, 2012).

Many other initiatives also advocate for 
gender equality in education, ranging from the 
advocacy-focused United Nations Adolescent 
Girls Task Force, co-chaired by UNFPA and 
UNICEF, to more action-oriented approaches 
like the Girls’ Education Challenge funded by the 
UK Department for International Development. 
This GMR offers multiple examples of interaction 
between global interventions and national 
processes (see Chapter 5). A tentative conclusion 
is that actions by EFA partners at the global 
level have helped keep gender equality high 
enough on the agenda to contribute to progress 
towards this goal.

Strategy 7: Actions to combat HIV and AIDS

At the time of Dakar, the AIDS epidemic was 
threatening the very foundations of education 
systems in southern and eastern Africa. There 
seemed a high risk the emergency would 
reach other parts of the world with disastrous 
consequences. Massive global mobilization over 
a very short period produced remarkable results, 
including a decreased infection rate and the 
availability of and access to new, more effective 
treatments. In 2015, while the battle is not yet 
won, the worst has been prevented.

Although the health sector took the lead 
and received the bulk of funding, the role of 
education was recognized as key. Education 
initiatives at the global level responded to 
the challenge with a strong sense of urgency, 

emphasizing two actions mentioned in the Dakar 
Framework: teacher training and curricula, and 
the policy mainstreaming of HIV and AIDS.

The UNAIDS Inter-Agency Task Team on 
Education (IATT) was established in 2002 to 
improve the sector’s response. Convened 
by UNESCO, it has promoted and supported 
good practices and encouraged alignment and 
harmonization among agencies. The IATT has 
also strengthened the evidence base, notably 
through global surveys in 2004 and 2011/12, and 
prepared technical tools to guide mainstreaming 
of the issue in education at the national level 
(UNESCO, 2006a, 2013a).

Also led by UNESCO, the Global Initiative on 
Education and HIV and AIDS (EDUCAIDS), 
launched in March 2004 by the UNAIDS 
Committee of Cosponsoring Organizations, aims 
to prevent the spread of HIV through education 
and to protect the core functions of education 
systems from the worst effects of the epidemic. 
It has mobilized partnerships at the country 
level, helped build capacity and offered technical 
support, notably through briefs on five essential 
components of an education sector response to 
HIV and AIDS (UNESCO, 2008a).

These mechanisms have helped the global 
education response to HIV and AIDS evolve. From 
an exclusive focus on scientific knowledge of 
HIV, attention shifted to comprehensive sexuality 
education, including non-cognitive skills, and 
eventually to structural issues linked to sexuality 
and gender (UNESCO, 2014a). Many countries 
have taken steps to adopt this broader approach, 
which should be credited to global post-
Dakar efforts.

However, implementation remains a problem. 
Levels of HIV knowledge remain unacceptably 
low (see Chapter 3), and challenges still exist 
with curricula, teacher training and teaching 
methodology to deliver a suitable curriculum. 
Without HIV education at primary level, which 
includes students older than primary age, a 
critical demographic will be missed because 
many children enter primary school late or leave 
school before they enrol in secondary school.

While the battle 
against HIV 
and AIDS is not 
yet won, the 
worst has been 
prevented

36

OVERVIEWEducation for All Global Monitoring Report1025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportStrategy 8: Safe, healthy, inclusive and equitably 
resourced educational environments

The Dakar Framework stressed how the quality 
of the learning environment would contribute 
to the achievement of the gender equality and 
quality goals. A very broad range of factors 
contribute to making a school facility conducive 
to learning. The global initiatives described 
below demonstrate the variety of approaches 
followed (Nederveen, 2010).

The Child Friendly School has been a key 
approach advocated by UNICEF. It is grounded 
in three principles: child-centred education, 
democratic participation and inclusiveness. It 
has been implemented since 1999 in almost 
100 countries, though its effective integration 
into national education plans varies widely. An 
evaluation found that the initiative provided 
national policy-makers with a useful framework 
to improve education and had the potential 
to start a process of school transformation. 
However, the study implicitly questioned its 
sustainability where governments or systems 
were not ready to support it (UNICEF, 2009b).

Focusing Resources on Effective School Health 
(FRESH) was launched in Dakar to advocate 
a holistic approach to improved health and 
nutrition. An inter-agency initiative on school 
health, it has four components: health-related 
school policies, provision of safe water and 
sanitation, skill-based health education, and 
school-based health and nutrition services. 
The initiative launched a guidance note on 
monitoring and evaluation of school health 
programmes (UNESCO, 2013c). However, FRESH  
has served more to coordinate partner activities 
than to directly improve uptake of relevant 
national policies.

Also in the area of school-based health 
and nutrition, the World Food Programme 
coordinates the Home Grown School Feeding 
initiative, established in 2003 and inspired by 
the United Nations Task Force on Hunger. The 
African Union has recommended the approach 
to its member states. At least 20 countries in the 
region implement relevant programmes, some 
partly supported by development partners and 
others fully government led. The partnership has 
been behind much of the recent evidence on the 
effects of school feeding, notably through the 

State of School Feeding Worldwide report (WFP, 
2013) (see Chapter 2).

The strategy’s grouping of such a disparate set 
of issues, from pedagogy to social protection to 
infrastructure, means it has lacked focus. The 
scope has been too wide to make assessment of 
initiatives possible. In addition, knowledge of key 
aspects of school conditions such as sanitation 
and safety has not improved at all since 2000. 
Nevertheless, it is clear that work at the global 
level has contributed little to help countries 
establish healthy learning environments. 

Strategy 9: Teacher status, morale 
and professionalism

The Dakar Framework identified several 
approaches to support teachers, including 
adequate remuneration, strategies encouraging 
retention, access to training and professional 
development, and participation in decision-
making, along with the suggestion that teachers, 
in turn, should be accountable to learners 
and communities.

The International Task Force on Teachers for 
EFA was established in 2008 to coordinate 
international efforts to fill the teacher gap, 
focusing on advocacy, policy dialogue and 
research. Its mandate covers only a subset of 
the issues identified as key teacher-related 
elements of an EFA strategy: policy; capacity, 
especially on data; and financing. An evaluation 
suggested that the task force was relevant, 
but that its objectives should be more closely 
related to country needs (Townsend, 2012). 
The task force has since carried out country 
studies following the methodological guide of the 
Teacher Training Initiative for sub-Saharan Africa 
(UNESCO, 2010b). However, the scope of its 
activities is limited.

The Joint ILO-UNESCO Committee of Experts 
on the Application of the Recommendations 
Concerning Teaching Personnel, while not 
a product of EFA, is the only international 
body with a mandate to monitor the status of 
teachers and it also reports on EFA issues. 
The committee meets every three years to 
monitor the use of the recommendations, 
examining reports submitted by governments, 
national organizations representing teachers, 
intergovernmental organizations and NGOs.

OVERVIEWIt shares its findings with the ILO Governing 
Body and the UNESCO Executive Board, which 
transmit them to member states for appropriate 
action. In 2012, the committee concluded that 
teaching was becoming deprofessionalized 
and encouraged member states ‘to precisely 
define the social status of teachers, and their 
professional dignity, especially in relation to 
other professions’ (ILO, 2012a). However, the 
committee is not a strong mechanism for 
change. Since 2000, there has been no progress 
in monitoring the status of teachers. The few 
initiatives that are relevant have not come from 
EFA partners (see Chapter 6).

Strategy 10: Harnessing of information and 
communication technology

The Dakar Framework emphasized the potential 
of information and communication technology 
(ICT) to deliver EFA. The cost of ICT was expected 
to fall, and the framework suggested such 
technology could be deployed to improve access 
to education for disadvantaged communities, 
to support professional development and 
to communicate across classrooms and 
cultures. At the same time, it warned of the 
risk of ICT increasing disparity and said such 
technology should serve, rather than drive, 
education strategies.

While older technology continues to be used 
for education development, the ambition of the 
Dakar Framework to use modern ICT has been 
challenged by the slow progress in infrastructure 
in poorer countries and speed of technology 
diffusion. In the absence of any major global 
coordination of ICT related to education, the 
closest example has been the annual Global 
Symposium series on ICT and education hosted 
by the Republic of Korea and organized since 
2007 by the World Bank in partnership with 
UNESCO (World Bank, 2014b).

These two organizations have collaborated in 
other areas as well, from indicators, as part of 
the Working Group on ICT Statistics in Education, 
to policy toolkits. The World Bank has developed 
policy guidance on ICT in education through 
its Systems Approach for Better Education 
Results initiative, while its influential blog 
series has addressed issues of policy relevance 
(Trucano, 2013). UNESCO and other partners 
have published in-depth regional studies of 

ICT use in education as part of the Partnership 
on Measuring ICT for Development (World 
Bank, 2014c).

As global coordination efforts have been 
relatively weak, however, it is hard to evaluate 
the effect they may have had at the national 
level. In practice, policy has often been distanced 
from implementation. Good examples often 
come from well-resourced contexts that cannot 
be replicated in poorer settings. Many questions 
have been raised about the relevance and 
effectiveness of ICT applications in education 
(see Chapter 6). More generally, some critics 
argue that harnessing ICT requires a shift in the 
education delivery paradigm (Daniel, 2010).

Strategy 11: Systematic monitoring of progress

The Dakar Framework urged improvement of 
monitoring at various levels. First, it called for 
robust and reliable education statistics. The 
work of the UIS has been instrumental, as an 
evaluation recognized, stressing that it had 
‘exceeded the expectations of most stakeholders 
in restoring the trust and confidence of Member 
States and the international community in the 
value of UNESCO’s statistical function and 
the credibility of internationally comparable 
education statistics’ (UNESCO, 2007b). 
Nevertheless, two concerns remain: timeliness, 
a problem also encountered in other sectors; 
and continuing gaps in several series of 
indicators (see Chapter 7 on missing data).

Second, the framework called for disaggregated 
education statistics. Since 2000, there has been 
a major increase in the availability of household 
survey data, notably from the Demographic and 
Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster 
Surveys, which have enabled monitoring of 
inequality in several dimensions. The GMR team 
used these data to launch its World Inequality 
Database on Education in 2010. The work of the 
International Household Survey Network has 
had a major effect on increasing the availability 
of surveys (Oxford Policy Management, 2013). 
However, two problems remain: the slow 
pace with which data sets are made available, 
and the lack of coordination across national 
and international survey programmes to set 
standards and provide a uniform set of core 
education-related questions (EPDC, 2009). 
Besides, at the national level, these data have 

Harnessing 
ICT requires 
a shift in the 
education 
delivery 
paradigm

38

OVERVIEWEducation for All Global Monitoring Report1025Education for All Global Monitoring Reportnot been utilized sufficiently, as the limited use of 
disaggregated information in national education 
plans suggests.

Third, the Dakar Framework called for improved 
information on national and international budget 
allocations for basic education. On domestic 
finance, data series on public education 
expenditure continue to be incomplete and 
lacking in detail. In addition, unlike in the health 
sector, almost no progress has been made in 
providing a full picture of how governments 
and households share financing education. 
On external finance, there has been important 
and continuing improvement in how donors 
report expenditure, under the leadership of 
the OECD DAC. Yet classification problems 
continue to hamper long-term trend analysis 
(see Chapter 8).

The Dakar Framework also made a strong call 
for a monitoring report that would serve as an 
opportunity to ‘hold the global community to 
account for commitments made in Dakar.’ The 
final decision on an editorially independent 
GMR was taken at the 2001 High-Level 
Group meeting. According to the most recent 
evaluation, the EFA Global Monitoring Report is 
‘widely perceived to be a high quality report, 
based on robust research and analysis that has 
firmly established it as an important resource  
for the education sector’ (EfC, 2014).

Overall, there has been clear improvement 
since 2000 in the way progress towards the 
EFA goals has been monitored and reported. 
However, in many ways the education sector 
lags behind health in quality of information. A 
notable example is the absence of information 
on a key indicator, the percentage of children 
who have mastered basic learning skills, one 
of the original EFA indicators. Literacy, another 
key outcome, has been imperfectly measured, 
despite some progress (see Chapter 4).

Progress at the global level is reflected in 
progress at the national level. Countries now 
report their administrative data more frequently. 
Some international initiatives, such as the 
education sector’s Country Status Reports, a 
joint work of the World Bank and UNESCO, have 
helped build capacity. External funding has 
supported the emergence of influential citizen-
led assessments, while national civil society 

initiatives have resulted in EFA education watch 
reports. However, countries have made less 
progress in producing comprehensive reviews of 
their own education sectors.

Strategy 12: Building on existing mechanisms

The final strategy stressed that activities should 
be ‘based on existing organizations, networks 
and initiatives, augmented where necessary.’ 
The role of the five EFA convening agencies has 
been touched on in the respective discussions 
of strategies, with a focus on their coordinating 
role. In addition, each agency played its own 
distinct role through programmatic activities, 
which have been independently evaluated, at 
least from the perspective of the agencies’ 
objectives, if not that of EFA (UNICEF, 2014d; 
Independent Evaluation Group, 2006).

An important question was the extent to 
which any of the ‘existing mechanisms’ would 
have been sufficient to hold the international 
community to account. The global EFA 
coordination mechanisms, which are mentioned 
explicitly under this strategy and which are 
discussed in the next section, clearly could not 
play such a role. For the right to education, a 
fundamental dimension of EFA also enshrined 
in the International Covenant on Economic, 
Social and Cultural Rights, a position of special 
rapporteur was established in 1998 to respond 
to information on alleged violations and engage 
governments in dialogue. Special rapporteurs 
are seen as having made contributions to 
the understanding and even implementation 
of rights, but rely heavily on governments’ 
cooperation (Golay et al., 2011).

A new mechanism, the Universal Periodic 
Review, is a country peer review process 
established by the UN General Assembly  
in 2006 to examine countries’ performance 
regarding human rights, including the right 
to free education. Despite its constraints, the 
process is seen as playing a constructive role 
in embedding human rights in governance 
(McMahon, 2012). Such a mechanism could have 
been used to review EFA progress with available 
monitoring information. Accountability was a 
missing link in the Dakar Framework, a way 
to turn monitoring into action, and remains an 
issue to be tackled after 2015.

OVERVIEWThe practice of influencing national  
EFA policy: Coordination

The analysis of how well EFA partners 
implemented the Dakar strategies at the global 
level is described above but also requires an 
overall assessment of agency coordination. The 
report card, unfortunately, is not positive.

The Dakar Framework did not establish a 
clear coordination mechanism for the five EFA 
convening agencies. In fact, the International 
Consultative Forum, the coordination 
mechanism that pre-dated Dakar, was abolished 
despite a recommendation to keep it (Little and 
Miller, 2000). Several key Dakar participants 
conveyed a sense that debate over leadership 
of the EFA process sidetracked substantive 
discussions on the best way to deliver EFA 
policies at the national level, thus squandering 
an opportunity to talk about effective 
implementation strategies.2

The Dakar Framework specified that UNESCO 
would ‘continue its mandated role in co-
ordinating EFA partners and maintaining 
their collaborative momentum’ and ‘convene 
annually a high-level, small and flexible group’ 
to serve ‘as a lever for political commitment and 
technical and financial resource mobilization.’ 
This High-Level Group met annually between 
2001 and 2011, supported by a working group set 
up partly in response to a commitment to involve 
‘working groups on each of the six goals’.

The decision in Dakar to assign full responsibility 
to UNESCO changed the arrangements of the 
Inter-Agency Commission that existed before 
2000, in which agencies shared power and 
responsibilities. Concerns were raised about 
UNESCO’s leadership of the initiative, as it was 
facing governance and financial issues at the 
time. Other agencies felt they could better lead 
the process or at least move it forward.

Meanwhile, the High-Level Group’s membership, 
intended to be ‘small and flexible’, expanded to 
include representation from various agencies 
and bodies, arguably diluting the group’s 
ability to advocate clearly and convincingly for 

2. A retrospective view of the EFA agenda and its implementation, with 
reflections from key participants involved in the World Education Forum in 
Dakar, can be found in the ‘Lessons from Dakar’ section of the EFA GMR

education reforms. The need to accommodate 
a larger and ever-changing group, coupled 
with the way meetings were managed, made 
it more difficult for substantive dialogue to 
occur and concrete recommendations to be 
advanced. The meetings failed to play a strategic 
coordination role (Burnett, 2010) on issues such 
as resource mobilization. 

This perceived loss of effectiveness led UNESCO 
to reform coordination arrangements in 2011. 
First it envisaged convening a new High-
Level Forum of world leaders and education 
champions in the spirit of Dakar to increase 
commitment and mobilization. However, by the 
time the forum was established, it was too little 
and too late. The Forum practically never met.

Instead, other bodies have taken over the role of 
leading high-level advocacy, including the GPE 
and the secretary-general’s Global Education 
First Initiative, established in 2012, which 
operates on the concept of champion countries. In 
recent years, new global education events, such 
as the World Innovation Summit for Education in 
Doha and the Education World Forum in London, 
have emerged and attracted high-level political 
representation and substantive dialogue in ways 
that the High-Level Group never achieved. 

Second, the High-Level Group and the Working 
Group were succeeded by the annual Global EFA 
Meeting, held in two parts, one high-level and 
ministerial and the other for senior officials and 
technical officers. Two meetings took place, in 
2012 and 2014. It is difficult to assess whether 
it managed to ‘critically assess progress’ and 
‘agree on tangible actions for follow-up’; its 
focus, with the 2015 deadline approaching fast, 
was on the post-2015 agenda.

Finally, a new body, the EFA Steering Committee, 
was set up in April 2012 to replace the 
International Advisory Panel that briefly met 
in 2007 and 2008 to provide strategic guidance 
on ‘monitoring, research, global advocacy, 
knowledge-sharing and partnerships for specific 
issues such as financing’ (UNESCO, 2011c). 
As with the Global EFA Meeting, after an initial 
focus on accelerating progress to 2015, its 
attention turned to the post-2015 agenda.

With respect to the other convening agencies, 
UNESCO made three attempts to clarify roles

with the Framework for Mutual Understanding, 
in 2002 with the International Strategy and in 
2005/06 with the Global Action Plan. However, 
one commentator called the last plan ‘little more 
than an inventory of what each organization 
already does. It gives us very little insight into 
the practical efforts that might allow UNESCO 
to indeed play a leadership role in the EFA 
movement’ (Sutton, 2007). In the end, ‘the 
dynamics and orientations of UNESCO and its EFA 
partners shifted, the Plan led to no specific steps, 
and the strategy discussions it had instigated fell 
out of sight’ (Robinson, 2014). In 2009, UNESCO 
commissioned an evaluation of its performance 
on global leadership and coordination, one of 
its strategic programme objectives. The review 
found ‘a lack of clarity about what successful 
global coordination and leadership look like’ 
within the organization (UNESCO, 2009b). It would 
be unfair to not recognize the difficulty of the 
task of coordination and convincing agencies to 
spend time and effort to align activities they feel 
they do not stand to benefit from. At the same 
time, it is also the case that, as the other EFA 
convenors gained influence and finances for 
education development, they gradually distanced 
themselves from working with UNESCO.

Overall, the formal EFA coordination mechanism, 
led by UNESCO, did not rise to the challenge of 
ensuring continuous political commitment and 
had limited success in actively engaging other 
convening agencies and key stakeholders. Many 
of the most successful mechanisms, initiatives 
and campaigns reviewed in this section happened 
in spite of, rather than as a result of, attempts at 
global coordination. UNESCO still has important 
power in terms of convening: when it calls a 
conference, member states participate and  
often at the highest ministerial level. Member 
states place trust in UNESCO to lead and 
coordinate the international agenda in education; 
indeed, being an ‘honest broker’ is viewed by 
UNESCO as one of its key missions (Burnett, 
2010). Nevertheless UNESCO’s assignment 
as the sole EFA coordinator appears to have 
undermined the effectiveness with which tasks 
were carried out, and it had mixed success in 
leading global coordination. The forthcoming 
evaluation of the EFA global coordination 
mechanism by the UNESCO Internal Oversight 
Service is expected to shed considerable light on 
these issues.

Putting together the evidence

The implementation of the 12 strategies from 
the Dakar Framework was reviewed to assess 
whether EFA partners fulfilled their pledges 
at the global level. This was a prerequisite for 
examining whether the strategies were sufficient 
to contribute to the five key medium-term 
results expected of an effective EFA architecture.

In assessing whether political commitment to 
EFA was reaffirmed and sustained throughout 
the period, it is clear that the EFA movement 
suffered once the MDGs became the dominant 
development agenda. The result was excessive 
emphasis on universal primary education, a 
target that appealed to the poorest countries, 
which were furthest from it, and to the richest 
countries, which were prepared to support its 
achievement. This made the EFA agenda less 
attractive to many countries that had already or 
nearly achieved universal primary education. As 
their interest waned, so did the universal appeal 
of the EFA agenda.

UNESCO received a strong endorsement 
in Dakar to continue its mandated role in 
EFA coordination to maintain the partners’ 
collaborative momentum. How did it perform? 
This role was easier to describe on paper than 
to interpret or implement. UNESCO made three 
attempts to prepare a global framework. They 
consumed a great deal of time, but attracted 
little interest and political support from the other 
EFA convening agencies, major international 
NGOs and bilateral development agencies. 
Largely because of lack of funds, UNESCO also 
had limited strength at country level to lead 
sector coordination efforts.

These limitations constrained political 
commitment on EFA, both within and beyond 
the international education community. The 
EFA High Level Group, which met annually for 
a decade, was designed to increase political 
commitment but left no clear evidence of 
success. Despite signs in 2000 that UNESCO 
might take a bold step in engaging with world 
leaders, it proved cautious in its approach to high 
level political engagement, emphasizing broad 
representation rather than political change. 
As it never gained political leverage, the forum 
of choice for global policy actors in education 
shifted away from the High-Level Group. 

The EFA  
agenda was 
less attractive 
to countries that 
had achieved

OVERVIEWFor example, as of 2015, the GPE is potentially 
much more influential politically, as its board 
membership demonstrates. By contrast, the 
assumption that global and regional conferences 
are powerful enough to hold countries and the 
international community to account has not 
proved in practice to be valid.

Since 2000, diverse types of knowledge,  
evidence and expertise have been communicated 
and used. The participation of non-state 
actors in formal coordination structures has 
enriched the debate. Foundations and civil 
society organizations have supported influential 
activities, such as early grade learning and 
tracking of public education expenditure. The 
past few years have seen a surge in attention to 
research on education system development, the 
political economy of education, and cross-cutting 
relationships between basic education and other 
development outcomes. EFA-related campaigns 
and initiatives have improved communication of 
their own strategic research-based messages.

However, much new evidence and many policy 
initiatives and research advances were not 
necessarily related to EFA activities, and too 
often came from outside the education sector. 
How evidence translates to change is difficult to 
track, yet while some of the new body of evidence 
did reach EFA coordination meetings, such as 
the working group, it did not appear to be used 
by the High-Level Group for policy-making.

Since 2000, there has been no shortage of 
national education plans. The GPE cites planning 
documents for 59 countries, most of which have 
been appraised. As the review of plans prepared 
for this GMR suggests, national plans are likely 
more robust and sound than before. However, it 
is less clear that new knowledge or tools have 
helped develop appropriate capacity for evidence-
based national policy-making or that they have 
strengthened national EFA policy and practice.

A key expected result of the Dakar process 
was that credible plans would help effectively 
mobilize financial resources for EFA. The rise 
in domestic education spending in low income 
countries was promising, but its main cause 
was increased domestic resource mobilization. 
There was a far smaller increase in the share of 
education in the budget. This puts into question 
the assumption that better plans were needed to 
increase financing.

International aid expanded considerably in 
absolute terms, yet its volume fell well short of 
the assessed need, was insufficiently targeted 
to the countries and education levels most 
in need, and declined as a share of recipient 
governments’ budget in the years after Dakar.

The Dakar Framework made a point of 
mentioning not only the volume of aid delivery 
but also how to improve its delivery. However, the 
lack of medium-term aid predictability remains 
a problem. Donors do not routinely communicate 
information on future aid to individual 
governments (GPE, 2012a). Aid agencies are not 
well configured to provide reliable medium- and 
long-term assurances of aid and it is easier for 
them, politically and operationally, to keep their 
options open (OECD, 2012b).

The framework also called for more effective 
donor coordination and sector-wide approaches, 
at a time when both concepts were becoming 
more popular, yet little was accomplished. 
Efforts have been made in some countries to 
harmonize and coordinate education support 
through new mechanisms, including the GPE. 
However, like overall aid, education aid remains 
highly fragmented (Rose et al., 2013). Meanwhile, 
the sector-wide approach began falling out of 
favour among donor agencies around the middle 
of the Dakar period, partly due to a push to 
demonstrate short-term results and account for 
every dollar spent (see Chapter 8). 

The evaluation of approaches to support planning 
concluded that some countries, at least initially, 
engaged in a parallel planning process, with 
a separate national EFA plan not integrated in 
overall national planning and budgeting (UNESCO, 
2006c). A similar challenge characterized the 
GPE approach, with appraisals and donor 
requirements potentially undermining country 
ownership (Cambridge Education et al., 2010).

A positive trend over the last 15 years was 
the increased transparency of monitoring 
and reporting on developments in education 
worldwide. With hindsight, the decision to 
introduce an independent monitoring and 
reporting mechanism of progress towards the 
EFA goals may have been critical in keeping EFA 
high on the agenda when other mechanisms 
faltered. But improved reporting was only

OVERVIEWEducation for All Global Monitoring Report1025Education for All Global Monitoring Reportprogress were characterized by a strong 
technical focus. The global mechanisms, 
initiatives and campaigns that have been 
relatively influential have had a clear set of 
objectives and dedicated strategic and technical 
capacity, are financed collectively and have overt 
political support and backing from influential 
bodies. They are evaluated regularly and in 
most cases have well-defined audiences 
for their work. Meanwhile, the potential for 
external influence on national educational 
policy and practice may not be as strong as the 
declaration’s aspirations, but is likely to have 
increased over the period. Monitoring education 
progress since Dakar has also improved 
and expanded. 

Areas of weakness were seen in interventions 
requiring coordination, political commitment 
and influence, which tended to be looser, 
voluntary mechanisms, technically competent 
but politically weak. The global coordination 
model, especially within the United Nations, has 
received relatively little scrutiny. Accountability 
for any global movement is inarguably a 
challenge, but in this case was absent and 
unaddressed. 

To critically evaluate EFA advances, a better 
understanding is needed of how global 
mechanisms contribute to progress towards 
long-term goals. In this way, the international 
community can learn whether to put faith in 
pledges such as those made in Dakar. In the end, 
the EFA movement can be characterized as a 
qualified success, even if EFA partners may have 
not collectively lived up to their commitments. 
But a lesson re-emerging over the past 15 years 
is that, while technical solutions are important, 
gaining political influence and traction is of 
even greater significance, particularly to realize 
the scale of reform and action required to 
achieve EFA at the national level. The current 
discussions on the post-2015 agenda may be 
offering just such a chance.

possible thanks to major improvement in data 
quality and analysis, often supported by EFA 
partners. The richness and quality of information 
available in 2015 is superior in all respects to 
what was available in 2000, while new channels 
of communication have opened important 
opportunities to create change.

Conclusions

Efforts since 2000 to advance education around 
the world became almost synonymous with 
ensuring that every child is in school. As this 
EFA – and MDG – target of universal access to 
primary education was more applicable to the 
poorest countries, other nations found it less 
relevant. The agenda was not seen as broad 
or universal enough, and countries took less 
ownership. Meanwhile, the focus on universal 
primary enrolment meant less attention on other 
crucial issues, such as how children benefit from 
their schooling experience, the consequences for 
those that missed receiving a good education, the 
need for early childhood care and education, and 
the failure to significantly reduce adult literacy.

Overall, not even this target was reached, 
let alone the more ambitious EFA goals. The 
extent of progress was less than anticipated 
and insufficient to match the scale of 
ambition. With an unfinished agenda and, with 
inequality increasing in many cases, the most 
disadvantaged continue to be the last to benefit. 
But there have been achievements that should 
not be underestimated. There is evidence that 
the world will have advanced by 2015 beyond 
where it would have been if the trends of the 
1990s had persisted. And the international 
community left the stagnation of the previous 
two decades well and truly behind. 

This chapter placed post-Dakar achievements 
onto a broader canvas. It noted that some key 
economic, political and social conditions were 
more favourable than in the decade or two prior 
to Dakar. While the effect of these changes 
cannot be quantified, they certainly helped 
many of the nations furthest from EFA focus on 
development across sectors, including education.

Was global mobilization in the aftermath of 
the World Education Forum effective? Areas of

solutions are

Yet, globally,  1 in 4 children under 5 were stunted in 2013 - a sign of a chronic deficiency in essential nutrients. ■In 2012, nearly 184 million children were enrolled in pre-primary education worldwide, an increase of nearly two-thirds since 1999. ■Governments have committed to expand pre-primary education but private providers still account for more than 31% of all enrolled children in half of countries with data worldwide. ■By 2014, 40 countries had instituted compulsory pre-primary education. In several Latin American countries, this led to a steady improvement in the enrolment of pre-primary aged children. ■The quality of childcare for very young children remains a serious issue.

The early childhood years set 
the foundation for life. They have 
enormous impact on children’s 
readiness for primary school and 
transition to secondary education. 
This chapter reviews progress in 
survival, nutrition and care, and 
enrolment levels in pre-primary 
education. It describes the benefits of 
early cognitive development, parental 
leave and child care services. It 
expresses concern over the quality 
of care and teaching, and equitable 
access to ECCE services. The chapter 
encourages governments to ensure 
adequate public funding for ECCE.

Major interventions to improve early childhood care and education 
have included the abolition of school fees; support for needy pupils; 
production and supply of teaching and learning materials, staff 
capacity-building; provision of school uniforms and meals; 
mainstreaming kindergarten, and stronger collaboration among 
ministries and between schools and communities.”

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALL1025Education for All Global Monitoring Report  Goal 1    Early childhood care and education

Expanding and improving comprehensive early childhood care and education, 
especially for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged children

64% since 1999 to nearly 184 million children 
worldwide in 2012. Yet large numbers of  
children continue to miss out, and inequality  
in opportunity is increasing for the poorest,  
those living in rural areas or slums, and  
those marginalized by disability, ethnic  
origin, religion or language. There are still  
too many children worldwide who do not 
reach their fifth birthday or who suffer from 
malnutrition. Many children still miss out on 
early learning experiences and support for  
their socio-emotional development. A key  
thread through this chapter is that the poorest 
and most at risk have the most to gain from 
good quality ECCE services and that achieving 
equitable access to them can reduce inequality 
in society (Engle et al., 2011).

The first half of the chapter examines issues 
regarding very young children, starting with  
key indicators of whether children’s health, 
nutrition and quality of care are being  
addressed, and progress in improving survival 
rates and nutritional status for children  
under 5. The next sections look at how young 
children’s cognitive and socio-emotional 
development can be supported both in the  
home and outside. The chapter then considers 
how a multisector approach can support 
ECCE delivery.

The second half of the chapter explores the 
uneven expansion of pre-primary provision  
and the rise in enrolment at this level. Lack in 
equity of access and poor quality of provision  
are major concerns. Also considered is the 
large role of the private sector, with some 
governments harnessing it to expand access 
and others relying on user fees for all financing 
of pre-primary education. Quality is a serious 
concern, especially the role of teachers, but  
also pedagogy, curricula and culture. 

The foundations of all learning are laid during 
the earliest years, when the basic building  
blocks of life are good health and nutrition, 
safety and support for emotional development  
in a caring home environment, and early  
and continuing cognitive stimulation through 
positive play and early learning. It is a basic 
human right for children to receive the  
support they need for their development. 
Getting the foundations right carries huge 
future benefits: better learning in school and 
higher educational attainment, which result in 
major social and economic gains for society. 
In addition, the efficiency of entire education 
systems can be increased by improving 
children’s readiness to learn, resulting in  
less repetition and dropout.

The great importance of early childhood  
was recognized in 2000 at the World  
Education Forum in the elaboration on  
goal 1 of the Dakar Framework for Action:  
not only the importance of early childhood  
care and education (ECCE1), but also its 
influence on each of the other goals. Hence  
this chapter addresses the question of what 
progress has been made in achieving this 
Education for All (EFA) goal in terms of how  
well countries are facilitating the building  
blocks of a strong foundation for life. The  
focus is on national progress in relation to  
key aspects of care and education, as opposed 
to macro trends, which are addressed in the 
introduction of this EFA Global Monitoring 
Report (GMR). 

Progress has been made in the number of 
children worldwide using ECCE services in a 
range of sectors. Pre-primary education2 is 
expanding, with enrolment having increased 

1. The term ECCE is adopted from the Dakar Framework for Action. As in  
the 2007 GMR, ECCE refers to a broad range of services, including support  
for children’s and often mothers’ or carers’ health, nutrition and hygiene,  
as well as for cognitive and socio-emotional development. It also includes 
pre-primary schooling for children of the appropriate age, and other forms  
of care for children below the pre-primary school age.
2. Pre-primary education is formalized early learning immediately preceding 
primary school. Pre-primary schools can be attached to primary schools 
or entirely separate. Countries define the number of years pre-primary 
schooling lasts; it can vary from one to three years and cover ages ranging 
from 3 to 7.

foundations 
right carries 
huge future 
benefits

GOAL 1: EARLY CHILDHOOD CARE AND EDUCATIONEarly childhood care and educationThere is some progress in 
survival and nutrition, but care 
is still of poor quality

Brain development in the 1,000 days after 
conception makes this a time of great risk  
and opportunity (Engle et al., 2011; Engle  
et al., 2013; Walker et al., 2011). Undernutrition 
from a poor and unvaried diet can lead to  
delays in gross and fine motor development, 
and even increased risk of mortality (Britto et 
al., 2013). While health may appear to be the 
most pressing concern at this stage of life, 
education also has a major role to play. Good 
nutrition is not enough. Children who are not 
stimulated cognitively and are underdeveloped 
socio-emotionally are also at greater risk of 
malnutrition and, ultimately, diminished life 
chances (Grantham-McGregor et al., 2007). 
Cooperation among health, education  

and social protection services is needed to 
combat the mutually reinforcing risk factors 
associated with widespread poverty.

Measurement of children’s development is 
complex and painstaking, and therefore not 
yet carried out on a large scale. The Dakar 
Framework did not establish any clear targets 
or indicators, although it did state: ‘All young 
children must be nurtured in safe and caring 
environments that allow them to become 
healthy, alert and secure and be able to learn.’

In 2013, there were 162 million malnourished 
children under 5 in the world. The GMR’s 
approach to monitoring goal 1 has developed 
over time, and has had to rely in many areas on 
proxy indicators. Up to the 2006 edition, pre-
primary enrolment was treated as synonymous 
with ECCE and the care elements of the goal 
were not addressed. In 2007, the GMR’s thematic

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 11025Education for All Global Monitoring Reportfocus was ECCE, marking the start of efforts to 
monitor early childhood care. The GMR included 
statistics on underweight and stunted children, 
and the proportion of children immunized at age 
1. Also reported was the under-5 mortality rate, a 
broad indicator of the state of children’s health 
and care, and mention was made of the fourth 
Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target of 
reducing the rate by two-thirds, from 1990 levels, 
by 2015 (UNESCO, 2007a). In 2009, monitoring 
against the MDG target was adopted, a practice 
continued in all subsequent editions.

This GMR, in addition to reporting progress on 
ECCE against the MDG child mortality target, 
uses indicators of health and care such as the 
proportion of births with skilled attendants, 
the proportion of immunized children and the 
stunting rate. For all indicators, this chapter 
charts progress from 1999 where possible, and 
also discusses developments or issues for which 

data were not available on a large scale in 1999. 
The rate of stunting, meaning low height for age, 
is a key indicator of a lack of good care, early 
childhood health, well-being and development. 
It is a highly reliable predictor of poor school 
achievement and cognition (Grantham-McGregor 
et al., 2007). According to the World Health 
Organization (WHO), it is a strong indicator of 
chronic child malnutrition (de Onis and Blössner, 
1997) and, by implication, of insufficient early 
childhood care. For this reason, the stunting rate is 
used in GMRs as an indicator of child nutrition and 
care, showing the extent of progress before  
and after 2000. Enrolment and attendance at 
pre-primary school are used to track growth in 
early childhood education.

GOAL 1: EARLY CHILDHOOD CARE AND EDUCATIONThere is some progress in survival and nutrition, but care is still of poor qualityhigh levels. However, the nearly 50% drop is 
insufficient to achieve the MDG target, set in 2000, 
of a two-thirds reduction from 1990 (Figure 1.1)  
(World Health Organization, 2013). Children 
continue to die – 6.3 million in 2013 (IGME, 2014) 
– from pneumonia, pre-term birth complications, 
birth asphyxia, diarrhoea, malaria and other 
causes, many of them preventable. Children 
are at greater risk if they are born in poverty, 
in a rural area and/or to an undereducated 
mother. Around 45% of all deaths are linked 
to malnutrition. Sub-Saharan African children 
are the most likely to suffer this, and are more 
than 15 times more likely to die before their 
fifth birthday than children in developed regions 
(World Health Organization, 2013).

To address child mortality, the political will of 
national and subnational governments is crucial, 
as is funding. Some of the countries struggling 
the most are some of the poorest, as well as 
being fragile and conflict-affected, such as 
Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
Mali, Sierra Leone and Somalia. Three countries 
have regressed since 1990: Lesotho, Swaziland 
and Zimbabwe, largely due to the impact of the 
AIDS pandemic. Encouragingly, many countries 
have made considerable progress since Dakar, 
including Malawi, Rwanda, Senegal and the 
United Republic of Tanzania. Child mortality is 
falling faster than at any other period in the last 
20 years (IGME, 2014). Between 2005 and 2012, 
the annual rate of reduction in child mortality 
was more than triple that of 1990–1995 (United 
Nations, 2014a).

Niger made remarkable progress. Starting from 
an extremely high baseline in a challenging 
context of high poverty and fertility, it progressed 
faster than richer West African neighbours 
(Amouzou et al., 2012). Its success was due to 
a combination of insecticide-treated bed nets, 
improved nutrition, vitamin A supplementation, 
vaccination, treatment of diarrhoea with oral 
rehydration salts and zinc, and people seeking 
medical care for fevers, malaria and pneumonia. 
External support made an enormous impact: 
funding from the vaccine alliance GAVI, the 
Global Fund and other donors for effective 
interventions proved crucial (Amouzou 
et al., 2012). 

Having a skilled birth attendant present during 
childbirth is critically important for the survival 
and health of both mother and child and is 
considered a robust indicator of the state of a 

country’s health care system. It is still common 
in many rural areas of developing countries  
for traditional birth attendants to be the  
only available help. An alarming degree of 
disparity in access between the poorest  
and richest women exists in many countries 
(Figure 1.2). However, since 2000 in countries 
including Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Nepal,  
Peru and Rwanda, great progress has been 
achieved in increasing the number of births 
aided by a skilled attendant. In Rwanda, 
the government instituted a policy in 2008 
of retraining traditional birth attendants in 
the basics of modern nursing and midwifery 
(Twahirwa, 2010). In most countries, except 
Nigeria and Zimbabwe, considerable progress 
has been made at the average wealth level.

Immunizing children against common and 
preventable illnesses is important to their 
overall health, and therefore also to their 
readiness to learn and subsequent schooling. 
Progress in ensuring that all children are 
fully immunized has not been fast enough in 
most countries that started from a low base 
in 2000, such as Ethiopia, Guinea and Nigeria 
(Figure 1.3). The gaps between the richest 
and poorest households continue to be vast, 
a disparity particularly striking in Pakistan, 
which, like countries including Guinea and the 
Philippines, has seen little improvement in the 
total percentage of children fully immunized. 
By contrast, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso 
and Cambodia have made great progress. 
Cambodia’s National Immunization Programme 
2006–2010 brought together the Ministry of 
Health, Department of Planning and Health 
Information, and Departments of Planning and 
Finance, as well as WHO, PATH and UNICEF, 
with a stated goal of focusing on hard-to-reach 
groups (Cambodia Government, 2006). However, 
disparity in access to immunization services 
remains the salient issue in many contexts.

Child nutrition conditions have improved – 
but not enough

Poor nutrition is a global problem that is 
rooted in poverty. Nutrition is not just about 
food availability; it is also dependent on water, 
sanitation and health care services to which poor 
families often lack access (UNESCO, 2012b). As 
the Dakar Framework stated, ‘Such programmes 
should be comprehensive, … encompassing 
health, nutrition and hygiene’.

Having a 
skilled birth 
attendant 
present during 
childbirth 
is critically 
important for 
both mother 
and child

GOAL 1: EARLY CHILDHOOD CARE AND EDUCATIONThere is some progress in survival and nutrition, but care is still of poor qualityLow maternal education is also a factor in poor 
nutrition, as findings in Burkina Faso, Kenya, 
Malawi, the United Republic of Tanzania and 
Zimbabwe have shown (Abuya et al., 2012;  
Maiga, 2012; Makoka, 2013). The process of 
stunting begins in utero or soon after birth, and 
the possibilities of catch-up growth are limited. 
Malnourished children attain fewer years of 
schooling and learn less while in school (Grantham-
McGregor et al., 2007). Coordinated interventions 
combining nutritional support, responsive  
feeding and stimulation, and early learning can  
fight the effects of poor diet. Stimulation and 
learning can be as crucial as the right foods  
(Walker et al., 2011; Yousafzai et al., 2014).

In general, most countries have made progress 
in reducing the percentage of stunted children 

since the 1990s (Figure 1.4). Countries started 
from vastly different levels of stunting, and made 
different degrees of progress. Sub-Saharan 
Africa started with the largest challenge. Many 
of the region’s countries, including Lesotho, 
Mali and Niger, have made noticeably strong 
progress since 2000, but the region still has by 
far the largest share of malnourished children, 
projected to reach 45% of the world total by 2020 
(de Onis et al., 2012).

Viet Nam has made enormous and consistent 
progress since 1990 through widespread vitamin 
A supplementation, universal salt iodization, 
disease control and the Stunting Reduction 
Strategy 2011–2020, although malnutrition 
continues to be common (Viet Nam National 
Institute of Nutrition, 2013). In Guatemala,

ministries and agencies possible (World Health 
Organization, 2014), leading to significant 
progress, but indigenous communities continue 
to be the most affected by malnutrition 
(Hoddinott et al., 2013). In Sierra Leone and 
Zimbabwe, the stunting rate has worsened,  
and urgent efforts are needed.

Stimulating children’s early cognitive 
development is a key building block

There is much more to early childhood care and 
education than keeping children safe and fed: 
children everywhere should be supported so 
that they thrive, not just survive (Myers, 1992). 
To achieve the goal of expanding and improving 
ECCE, the Dakar Framework recommended 
the ‘education of parents and other caregivers 
in better child care, building on traditional 
practices’. Yet there have been few well-
developed initiatives to measure and set targets 
for ‘better child care’ that includes cognitive 
and emotional stimulation. Plotting progress 
since 2000 towards this aspect of the goal is 
thus impossible.

What is known is that many less educated 
parents lack the resources and knowledge 
to boost their children’s early cognitive 
development. Very young children need to 
interact with their caregivers and be spoken to 
as much as possible for verbal development 
(Britto et al., 2013). They also require stimulation 
through play and other responsive interactions. 
Parents in contexts across the world, especially 
less educated parents, could benefit from 
support to ensure that their children receive 
the needed stimulation and that their socio-
emotional development is fostered.

Parenting can improve through programmes in 
or outside the home, in groups or individually. 
Home visiting programmes provide one-
on-one support and tend to run anywhere 
from two weeks to three years, focusing on 
showing mothers age-appropriate activities 
fostering mother–child interaction using 
common items already in the home. Such 
programmes often also focus on nutrition, 
health care and child development, and tend 
to have wide-ranging positive effects (Box 1.1). 
These can include improvement in behaviour, 
height for weight, schooling outcomes and IQ, 

Box 1.1: Parenting support for psychosocial 
development proves more beneficial than  
improved nutrition

In Jamaica, improved quality of parenting has resulted in 
enormous benefits for children in households involved in 
a home-visiting programme aimed at improving mother– 
child interactions. Over a two-year period, health workers 
in Kingston made weekly visits to households living in 
poverty that had stunted children aged 9 months to 24 
months. The purpose was to help the mothers spark their 
children’s psychosocial development through positive 
play. Twenty years later, as young adults, the subjects 
had earnings that were 25% higher than those of a 
control group, a level at par with that of non-stunted 
peers. They were also less likely to have been involved in 
crime. There were no positive effects for children given 
nutritional supplementation alone.

These findings are backed up by a considerable body 
of evidence, drawn from many countries, showing that 
the effect of nutrition is important, but that stimulation 
of the child is consistently and significantly beneficial 
to child development. The positive effects in Jamaica 
were substantially larger than for children receiving 
similar interventions in the United States, indicating that 
such approaches may be more beneficial not only to the 
poor and marginalized in general, but especially to such 
groups living in poorer countries – a double win for early 
childhood development programming.

as well as in mothers’ assessment of their 
own parenting practices, their knowledge 
about child development and even maternal 
depression levels.

In Pakistan, Lady Health Workers have provided 
home visiting services since 1994. A recent 
study compared the effects of two types of 
intervention delivered by these home visitors: 
nutrition education and supplementation, on 
the one hand, and, on the other, psychosocial 
stimulation that involved the visitors working with 
mothers individually and in groups to encourage 
them to engage in responsive play with their 
children. Separate groups received one or the 
other intervention while a third group received 
both. A fourth, the control group, received the 
standard home visiting programme covering 
health, hygiene and basic nutrition education. 
It was found that the largest impact came from 
psychosocial stimulation, with significantly 
higher scores for cognitive, language and motor

GOAL 1: EARLY CHILDHOOD CARE AND EDUCATIONThere is some progress in survival and nutrition, but care is still of poor qualityskill development at 12 and 24 months of age. 
Nutrition supplementation alone also had 
positive effects in these areas, but these  
were less enduring. The study found that 
delivering such interventions through home 
visits is a viable option for reaching the more 
than 200 million children worldwide who are  
not meeting their developmental potential 
(Yousafzai et al., 2014).

Parental leave and child care services 
can help families to support children’s 
development

Very early childhood is thought of in markedly 
different ways in different cultural settings. 
In some cultures, it is felt that young children 
should be in the home (Shaeffer, 2015). In 
several Arab states, particularly for children up 
to around age 3, child care is viewed as a family 
responsibility (Faour, 2010). In such contexts, 
families, especially poor families, need to be 
supported to start the process of early cognitive 
development and learning for their children.

A large part of care in the earliest period of 
life is affected by cultural (and often gendered) 
views related to parents’ opportunity to be home 
from work to care for and bond with the child. 
Maternity protection, in the form of leave from 
work with financial support, during the first 
weeks and months of a baby’s life is essential to 
the health and well-being of mother and child. 
Though nearly all countries have legal provision 
for such leave, issues with enforcement remain: 
only 28% of employed women worldwide 
are likely to receive cash maternity benefits 
(ILO, 2014b).

The presence and involvement of fathers is 
extremely important to child development 
(O’Brien, 2009). Fathers who take time to be with 
their family immediately after the birth are more 
likely to be involved with their young children 
long term (Huerta et al., 2013). By 2013, paternal 
leave of some kind was provided in 78 out of  
167 countries, with paid leave in 70; ‘Parental 
leave’ is a longer-term leave of absence from 
work, commencing after maternity leave. In 
some contexts, policies encourage fathers to 
share parental leave with mothers; in others, 
paternal leave is part of the parental leave 
entitlement. However, as payment is often lower 
or non-existent, men may be reluctant to take 
such leave (ILO, 2014b).

Despite increasing maternal and parental leave, 
reliance on child care services outside the 
home is growing, particularly in more developed 
contexts (OECD, 2006; Yoshikawa and Kabay, 
2015). Countries are increasing participation 
in ECCE services in various ways (Box 1.2). 
Availability of organized child care can free 
women to enter paid employment to boost the 
economic prospects of families, increase gender 
equality and raise national productivity (OECD, 
2006). It can also free older siblings to pursue 
their own education. However, too often child 

Box 1.2: Countries have followed different 
paths to increase demand for and access  
to ECCE

While there is strong demand from some parents for ECCE 
services, demand is not uniform and the children most at 
risk are often the least likely to benefit. The cost to parents 
of these services is often an issue in poor communities. 
Certain countries are making efforts to boost demand 
for ECCE. Recognizing that financial incentives can spur 
participation, cash transfers that are conditional on 
participation in early childhood development programmes 
have been used in countries including Ecuador, Malaysia, 
Niger, the Philippines and Rwanda.

Programmes’ lack of visibility or inability to adapt to 
families’ needs also affects participation. In Indonesia, 
the government has tackled this issue aggressively by 
establishing ECCE centres in 65% of villages in the country 
and publicizing their existence, and there are further plans 
to provide centres in every village. 

Thailand’s National Scheme of Education 2002–2016 aims 
for all children up to age 5 to participate in a development 
programme that prepares them ‘in all aspects’ before they 
enter the formal schooling system. This policy built on 
growing interest in child development, which manifested 
as early as 1979 in the country’s first child development 
plan. Yet despite a Long-Term Plan and Strategy for Early 
Childhood Care and Development 2007–2016, aimed at 
those up to age 5, few children aged 3 or under attend 
child care facilities.

Promotion of group child care activities in contexts where 
traditional cultures and languages are under threat can 
be both effective and popular. The ‘language nest’ model 
pioneered in Maori communities in New Zealand, where 
young children are immersed in their ancestral language 
with older community members, has also been used 
in indigenous communities in the Americas. A similar 
concept can be used in other types of ethnic and religious 
minority communities as a way to maintain and even 
revitalize culture.

and safe while their parents are at work, rather 
than providing crucial cognitive and socio-
emotional stimulation (Shonkoff and Philips, 
2000; Yoshikawa and Kabay, 2015).

Quality of services is important even for 
very young children

Defining and measuring quality can be 
challenging. Ideally it should reflect local 
values and perspectives on young children’s 
development as well as scientifically established 
predictors of their cognitive, language and 
socio-emotional development. No internationally 
comparable data are available on the quality 
of all types of care for very young children, 
so it is not possible to chart progress in this 
area since 2000.

There is broad consensus on certain ‘domains’ 
of quality considered important: space and 
furnishings; personal care routines; listening 
and talking; activities and interactions with 
children; programme structure; relationships 
with parents and staff; and response to staff 
professional development needs (Frank Porter 
Graham Child Development Institute, n.d.; 
Peralta, 2008). The staff members who look 
after children are of vital importance, including 
their education and their ability to form warm, 
responsive and enduring relationships (Gialamas 
et al., 2013; Mtahabwa and Rao, 2010). Use of the 
mother tongue, opportunities to learn through 
playful interactions with adults and other 
children, appropriate learning materials and a 
context where young children have space to be 
physically active are other important conditions 
for good quality ECCE (Mathers et al., 2014).

Poor quality care, whether in the home or in 
a centre, leads to poor outcomes in language, 
sociability and cognitive abilities (Penn, 2010). 
Education and training are necessary to ensure 
good quality care, but what level of education 
and training should be considered essential 
for early childhood carers? Research from low 
income countries is limited, making it difficult 
to draw conclusions across different contexts. 
However, it is clear that to promote children’s 
development, ECCE professionals must be 
skilled in building relationships with children and 
families and possess a solid understanding of 
how young children develop.

Crucial for home visiting programmes are an 
ability to build enduring relationships of trust with 
families, due to the intimate nature of the role; and 
training in the skills and knowledge needed to do 
the job (van Ravens, 2014). Pakistan’s Lady Health 
Workers have shown how effective such visitors 
can be, but also that they require extensive training 
to deliver multiple simultaneous interventions 
effectively (Yousafzai et al., 2014).

Visitors also need practice and training to work 
with mothers of all social classes, particularly in 
contexts such as India, where this is potentially 
difficult. An evaluation in India found that home 
visitors needed extensive training involving role 
play to practise the types of games and activities 
shared with mothers during visits. They also 
needed both theoretical and practical knowledge 
to convince mothers that simple games, such 
as banging together or stacking objects, were 
helpful to children’s development (Fernandez-
Rao et al., 2014).

For centre-based child care, staff training and 
qualifications are inconsistent across and within 
countries (Mathers et al., 2014), often resulting 
in the uneven provision of quality care (Centre 
for Early Childhood Education and Development, 
2013; Karuppiah, 2014). It is agreed that ECCE 
professionals are more effective in supporting 
children’s development if they have at least some 
specialized education and training (Mathers 
et al., 2014). In Australia, both the staff and 
directors of a child care centre felt that quality in 
infant care was related to affective dimensions 
such as love, care and attention, as well as 
specific activities for infants’ learning and 
cognitive development. Staff expressed the view 
that training should have a strong practical focus 
to provide the necessary knowledge and skills 
for working with infants (Brownlee et al., 2009).

Relying on insufficiently trained staff can lead 
to disappointing results, as in Peru (Box 1.3). In 
general, the low pay and status of early childhood 
workers undermine the possibility of recruiting 
and retaining high-calibre staff (Karuppiah, 
2014). High turnover damages the relationships 
which are so key to children’s development 
(Gialamas et al., 2013; Mathers et al., 2014).

GOAL 1: EARLY CHILDHOOD CARE AND EDUCATIONThere is some progress in survival and nutrition, but care is still of poor qualityBox 1.3: Peru’s government day care: more and better training and support of staff are needed

Since 1993, the Peruvian government’s Programa Nacional 
Wawa Wasi has provided community-based day care, 
targeting children aged 6 months to 4 years in slums. For a 
small fee, parents can leave their children in a safe home 
environment where a ‘Mother Carer’ looks after no more 
than eight children. The programme includes early learning, 
social and cultural identity development, healthy meals 
and teaching on nutrition, personal hygiene, training for 
parents on positive child-rearing practices, and government 
monitoring of height, weight and vaccination status.

Coverage has expanded from urban to rural areas, in a 
modified form of provision, although remote Andean villages 
and other poor communities are less extensively served. 
Mother Carers are selected and screened by the community 
and provided with training. They receive support from field 
coordinators, as well as further training ranging from weekly 
to twice yearly.

Several evaluations found implementation to be weak, 
however, indicating that staff need further training.  
Levels of performance of some activities were low:  
46% of Mother Carers did not organize and conduct  
cognitive stimulation activities, only 38% of stipulated 
monitoring checks on height and weight were carried  
out, and 70% of parents did not report receiving education  
in positive child-rearing practices. Some studies found  
that levels of chronic malnutrition, anaemia and deficits  
in psychomotor development were the same as in  
non-participants. Staff development does not sufficiently 
cover cognitive stimulation. Because staff are not  
sufficiently skilled or trained to provide a comprehensive 
programme, many parents see Wawa Wasi as safe child  
care with nutritious food, rather than a programme of  
early learning.

Many countries are on their 
way to a multisector approach 
to early childhood services

In exhorting countries to expand and improve 
comprehensive ECCE, particularly for the poor 
and marginalized, the Dakar Framework for 
Action calls for national, multisector policies 
supported by adequate resources. Since 2000, 
many countries have developed such policies, 
along with legal frameworks (Neuman and 
Devercelli, 2012).

The idea of integrated early childhood services 
has received much attention in the academic 
literature in recent years. However, this is not 
the same as the multisector approach called 
for at Dakar. Both concepts could involve either 
a policy framework that coordinates policies 
among sectors or one unifying policy for all 
ministries and agencies concerned (Vargas-
Barón, 2005). But a fully integrated policy 
would mean integrated budgets and tight 
coordination of service delivery at every level of 
government. Such coordination and sequencing 
of interventions across sectors is intended to 
create synergy resulting in an impact greater 
than the sum of the uncoordinated parts (van 
Ravens, 2014). Relevant sectors would include 
health care, nutrition, education, poverty 
alleviation, and social and child protection. 

Services could be aimed at pregnant women, at 
children from before birth to beyond the start of 
primary school, and at caregivers. Programmes 
might be carried out in households, child 
care and early education centres, pre-primary 
sections of primary schools, community centres, 
health centres and hospitals (Neuman and 
Devercelli, 2012).

While an integrated approach seems ideal, it is 
not practical (van Ravens, 2014), and virtually 
no large-scale implementation of highly 
coordinated policies currently exists (Black 
and Dewey, 2014). The high level of government 
capacity needed for planning and cooperation 
across departments and ministries makes such 
policies overly ambitious in many contexts (van 
Ravens, 2014). No developed country has taken 
a fully integrated approach to support ECCE. 
Rather, single sectors work alongside each other 
in cooperation, as in the Netherlands. Cuba 
has achieved a participation rate of 94% for 
children aged 3 to 5 years and pregnant women 
in a broad range of early childhood services 
(Annex, Statistical Table 3B), not integrated in 
a single policy framework but implemented via 
a range of separate laws, decrees and bylaws 
(Vargas-Barón, 2015).

A multisector approach, with varying 
combinations of services provided by separate 
sectors, will likely prove more realistic in most

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 11025Education for All Global Monitoring Reportcontexts. Examples of early childhood policies 
provided separately by single sectors include 
the law that established the Colombian Institute 
of Family Welfare, as early as 1968, and the 
Philippines’ Early Childhood Care and Education 
Act of 2000 (Box 1.4) (Vargas-Barón, 2015).

As of 2014, many countries had developed 
explicitly multisector policies, or policies that 
serve as umbrellas covering several sectors. 
Seventy-eight countries report having adopted 
multisector ECCE policy instruments3 and 
23 say they are preparing such instruments 
(Vargas-Barón, 2015).

The Arab States region is the furthest behind, 
with only Algeria, Jordan and Palestine 
developing policies. From a very low baseline 
in 2000, when only Ghana, Mauritius, Namibia 
and South Africa had developed ECCE policies, 
sub-Saharan Africa has made great strides: 30 
countries have adopted such policies and 7 are 
developing them (Vargas-Barón, 2015); many of 
the rest are fragile or conflict-affected (Neuman 
and Devercelli, 2012).

Multisector approaches have proved successful 
in a range of contexts, as in Colombia (Box 1.4), 
but can also be effective in a particular context, 
such as that of disability (Box 1.5).

Various elements contribute to the success of 
multisector policies, including coordination, 
cooperation and agreed measurements of 
progress across ministries and agencies 
(DiGirolamo et al., 2014) and staff continuity 
(Vargas-Barón, 2015). The leadership function by 
a designated ministry is likely to be important in 
most contexts. Links should be formed across 
partner agencies, and the implementation 
capacity at the middle and lower levels of 
government are important to address and are 
often neglected (Britto et al., 2014). In China, the 
success of an early childhood programme was 
helped by strong commitment at the national 
government level, complemented by provincial 
and local-level collaboration (Engle et al., 2013).

In sub-Saharan Africa, development partners 
including UNICEF and UNESCO were influential 
in the development of ECCE policies, but

continued support is necessary to ensure their 
implementation. Where policy development does 
not take place entirely within a specific context 
and involving key local stakeholders, crucial 
issues may be overlooked. A resulting lack of 
ownership may translate to insufficient political 
will for implementation. Extensive consultations 
can help achieve buy-in. In Brazil, it was felt that 
wide review of draft versions of the 2010 National 
Plan for Early Childhood, by government staff at 
all levels and civil society representatives, led to

Box 1.4: Colombia reaches many of its most 
vulnerable under-5s

Every child under 5 has to attend pre-school. Early 
childhood education is a major priority.

– Martha Isabel Castano, Primary school teacher, 
Colombia 

Since 1968, the Colombian government has been 
developing home- and centre-based child care and  
pre-primary schools to support vulnerable children. In 
2006, the National Council on Economic and Social Policy 
approved a National Public Policy for Early Childhood. 
Major steps were taken towards coordination between  
the Ministry of Social Protection and the Ministry of 
Education, culminating in the National Development  
Plan for 2010–2014 and the ‘From Zero to Forever’  
policy, creating a comprehensive system of early 
childhood development and targeting the poor and 
vulnerable in particular.

The policy goals, also codified in law in 2009, emphasize 
a priority on low income children, starting with care 
for expectant mothers. Children are guaranteed 
adequate nutrition, pre-primary education (including one 
compulsory year at age 5) and comprehensive health 
care. Implementation began within two years, supported 
by the necessary financing, an initial investment to reach 
the 2.1 million most vulnerable children. Six percent of 
education spending was dedicated to ‘initial education’ of 
children aged 4 and under. Large new centres were built 
in communities and staffed with teams drawn from social 
work, psychology and teaching.

Progress in reaching low income children under 5 has 
been considerable: 25% receive comprehensive ECCE 
services and 42% are enrolled in day care. However, 
decentralization provides both opportunities and 
obstacles. Some governors and mayors do not support 
the national policy as strongly as others, and the 
subcontracting of many aspects of service delivery to  
non-state providers presents a challenge in ensuring 
uniform standards of quality.

GOAL 1: EARLY CHILDHOOD CARE AND EDUCATIONMany countries are on their way to a multisector approach to early childhood servicesBox 1.5: A multisector approach can  
address disability early and help both 
children and families

Disability is strongly linked with poverty and 
marginalization. Children with disabilities are among 
the world’s most marginalized, excluded populations. 
A multisector approach is crucial for assessing and 
addressing disability in children. Addressing this issue 
early helps children and their families improve their 
potential life outcomes.

Disabled children are a significant proportion of those 
marginalized, so to reach a large number of marginalized 
children, policies must effectively target children with 
disabilities and the multitude of contexts in which they live. 
The earlier disability is diagnosed, the better for children 
and their families. Early childhood services provided 
by multiple sectors can be crucial for reaching children 
early and comprehensively. Children with disabilities are 
often kept at home, without access to opportunities other 
children might have. Home visiting programmes can 
reach these children when other types of services might 
not. They also have the important role of educating and 
supporting parents in positive interaction and supporting 
children’s development in their first learning and care 
environment, the household.

Parents may lack the knowledge to assess children’s 
development and require intervention from a health 
care or education professional. Some low and middle 
income countries are leading the way in this respect. 
Child assessment instruments have been developed 
and continue to evolve in India and China (among other 
countries). Such instruments require the involvement of 
both parents and professionals, particularly in contexts 
of low literacy. Widespread developmental screening of 
young children continues to be lacking in many low income 
countries, however.

Once their disability is assessed, affected children need 
support to do what other children do. It is now widely 
accepted that separating children from their peers or 
families is detrimental to their development and potential. 
In Central and Eastern Europe, where it has long been the 
practice to institutionalize disabled children, countries are 
moving away from that trend. Wherever possible, children 
living with disability should experience as normal a family 
life as possible and receive education in inclusive schools, 
with added support in terms of health care and learning.1 
Coordinated, multisector approaches can help achieve 
this goal. Jamaica is making a concerted effort to assess 
children’s special needs, rolling out an assessment tool 
nationwide in the 2014/15 school year to aid pre-primary 
teachers in identifying children who require extra support.

with disabilities versus segregation.

a sense of ownership by sector leaders and other 
stakeholders (Vargas-Barón, 2015).

An agreed policy document can be both a benefit 
and a liability. It can be used to claim progress, 
while its official adoption and implementation 
can be delayed indefinitely (Neuman and 
Devercelli, 2012). In Nigeria, the National Policy 
for Integrated Early Childhood Development was 
approved in 2007 but implementation has not 
yet started. Implementation plans have been 
drafted but not costed, and there is no financing 
provision (UNICEF, 2007; World Bank, 2013d). 
Shorter action plans and specific implementation 
plans are necessary to translate official policies 
into reality, but as of 2014, only 28 countries had 
developed the necessary strategic plans to guide 
implementation (Vargas-Barón, 2015).

Pre-primary education  
systems and enrolment  
levels have expanded rapidly  
in some countries

Access to good quality pre-primary education 
has an enormous impact on a child’s primary 
education outcomes, with effects often lasting 
into later life (Berlinski et al., 2009). The 
Dakar Framework noted the role of national 
governments and stated that programmes 
should be appropriately designed and targeted: 
‘Governments … have the primary responsibility 
of formulating [ECCE] policies … and promoting 
flexible, adaptable programmes for young 
children that are appropriate to their age and 
not mere downward extensions of formal 
school systems.’

A review of studies from Argentina, Brazil, 
Colombia, India, Morocco, Peru and Turkey found 
that early interventions tended to have a positive 
effect on likelihood of enrolment, on avoiding 
repetition and dropout, and on achievement in 
the early primary school years. These effects can 
be very large, and tend to be much greater in the 
case of poor and marginalized children (Myers, 
1992; Myers, 2004). Expanding pre-primary 
access, whether through formal or informal 
programmes, is therefore vital for improving 
children’s life chances, increasing the efficiency

reducing inequity in the broader society.

Enrolment has risen by 64% in little more 
than a decade, but with great inequality

The world has witnessed an increase of 64% 
in enrolment in pre-primary schooling, a 
considerable achievement, even though the 
baseline in 1999 was very low. Girls account  
for 49% of the increase and around half of 
total pre-primary enrolment in 2012. Certain 
countries have demonstrated progress with 
massive expansion of their public pre-primary 
systems. Kazakhstan in 1999 was the first 
country in Central Asia to make a year of pre-
primary schooling compulsory, thus reducing 
the gap in participation between the richest 
and poorest. Viet Nam also hugely expanded 
government provision, leading to an increase in 
the gross enrolment ratio (GER) while private 
enrolment dropped (Shaeffer, 2015).

However, progress in access has been uneven, 
with considerable difference between urban 
and rural areas, rich and poor families and 
communities, and thriving and deprived regions 
within countries (Delprato et al. forthcoming). 
Considerable inequity also remains in families’ 
access to good quality pre-primary education 
(Britto et al., 2014).

Many sub-Saharan African countries, as well 
as some Asian and Arab countries, started 
from extremely low baselines in 1999 to make 
progress in increasing pre-primary school 
enrolment ratios (Figure 1.5). Ghana is a 
striking exception: as school fees at this level 
had been abolished, participation started at a 
higher baseline yet still showed improvement. 
South Africa also made strong progress, 
providing one year of pre-primary education at 
primary schools. Nepal took action to expand 
pre-primary education in successive national 
development plans. Considerable effort was 
also made in Mongolia, whose Education Sector 
Master Plan (2006–2015) established culturally 
and context-appropriate mobile kindergartens 
housed in ger (yurts), which dramatically 
widened access (Mongolia Government, 2006).

As with enrolment ratios, most sub-Saharan 
African and many Arab and Asian countries have 
not made huge strides since Dakar in increasing 

pre-primary school life expectancy, the  
average number of years a child stays in  
pre-primary education (Figure 1.6). South 
Africa’s pre-primary school life expectancy of 
close to one year reflects the single ‘reception 
year’ provided by government. Thailand has 
progressed due to the government’s concerted 
effort to expand access to and raise demand for 
child-friendly pre-primary schooling (Shaeffer, 
2015), i.e. schooling that is suitable for young 
children and does not merely imitate primary 
school with desks, subject classes and books. 
Algeria’s massive expansion of pre-primary 
provision has led to an increase from virtually 
no pre-primary school life expectancy to 
nearly one year.

Living in a rural area can be a major obstacle 
to access (Figure 1.7). In some of the poorest 
countries, people living in rural areas and 
members of the poorest population group have 
an almost equally low chance of attending an 
early learning programme. Urban dwellers and 
the richest overall have a higher likelihood, yet 
participation is low even for them. With rising 
access come widening disparities, as the figure 
dramatically illustrates for the Lao People’s 
Democratic Republic and Tunisia. Viet Nam 
made the most progress in raising the chance 
of early learning programmes for the very worst 
off, including children from minority language 
groups (UNESCO, 2014c).

In Kenya, Mongolia, Tajikistan and Togo,  
living in a rural area and/or being poor and 
marginalized cuts a child’s chances of  
attending early learning programmes. This is 
also true in Ghana and Kazakhstan, despite 
positive policy changes. Within-country 
inequality can be large: in the United Republic of 
Tanzania there are stark differences by wealth, 
as well as gaps between provinces as wide 
as 71 percentage points (World Bank, 2012c). 
Inequity between urban and rural areas can also 
be seen in the physical learning environment, 
the classroom process and teacher–child 
interactions (Mtahabwa and Rao, 2010). Nigeria 
and Uganda have some of the worst inequality 
in access by wealth (Figure 1.8), with southern 
Nigerian government schools much more 
likely to provide early learning programmes. 
There are other factors as well: in Thailand the 
generally strong national commitment to young 
children has let down non-Thai migrant and

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 11025Education for All Global Monitoring Reportrefugee children, only 55% of whom attend ECCE 
programmes, compared with 93% nationally 
(Shaeffer, 2015).

Based on progress to date, projections on  
pre-primary gross enrolment ratios by 2015 were 
possible for 148 countries. Seventy countries, or 
47%, are likely to have high enrolment ratios, 
considered to be more than 80%. All EFA regions 
are included in this category, but the majority of 
these countries come from Central and Eastern 
Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, and 
North America and Western Europe. Twelve 
countries, or 8% would fall into the intermediate 
position with GERs of between 70% and 79%. 
Sixty-six countries would have either low (30-
69%) or very low (below 30%) GER, accounting 
for 25% and 20% respectively of the projection 
sample. Almost half of the countries with very 
low GER would be from sub-Saharan Africa 
(Bruneforth, 2015). 

There are several ways to spur greater 
expansion in enrolment

Governments can take action in a variety  
of ways to increase the number of children  
in pre-primary education, including laws, 
policies, public awareness campaigns,  
financial incentives and fee abolition. Laws  
can be used to mandate participation in  
pre-primary schooling. In 2001, Mexico made 
pre-primary schooling mandatory for children 
aged 4 to 5 (UNESCO-IBE, 2012); by 2012 the 
GER had risen to 101%, from 70% in 1999 
(Annex, Statistical Table 3B). Peru made 
two years of pre-primary education free and 
compulsory in 2003 starting at age 3 (Peru 
Government, 2003). Ghana did the same in 
2007 (Table 1). Myanmar recently mandated 
one year of compulsory pre-primary school 
(Shaeffer, 2015).

By 2014, 40 countries had instituted compulsory 
pre-primary education (Table 1.1). In several  
Latin American countries this trend has  
resulted in steady improvement in enrolment 
of children of pre-primary school age (Diawara, 
2007). Central and Eastern Europe and Latin 
America and the Caribbean showed the 
strongest growth in enrolment ratios (Figure 
1.5). They also have the most countries with 
compulsory pre-primary schooling. Argentina 
mandated pre-primary education as early as 

1993, and its GER climbed from 57% in 1999 to 
74% in 2012 (Annex, Statistical Table 3B).

Many countries have policies to include  
pre-primary education in the basic education 
cycle, but do not support them financially. In 
Kenya and the United Republic of Tanzania, laws 
require pre-primary sections to be attached 
to all primary schools, but in both countries 
fees are being charged. Because Tanzanian 
primary school capitation grants have been 
stretched to cover pre-primary pupils as well 
(World Bank, 2012c), pre-primary sections are 
under-resourced and terribly overcrowded, with 
an average pupil/teacher ratio of 57:1 in 2010 
(Annex, Statistical Table 8).

Cost is a major issue at the pre-primary level, 
with many governments charging fees (O’Gara, 
2013). Countries like Ghana that have abolished 
fees have seen major growth in pre-school 
participation, although the government has 
struggled to find the resources necessary to 
maintain standards (Shaeffer, 2015). Brazil’s 
government pre-schools do not charge fees, and 
serve 86% of all enrolled children (Bastos and 
Straume, 2013).

Financial incentives for enrolment can help. 
In rural China, an experimental programme 
provided families with a tuition waiver and a cash 
transfer conditional on an attendance rate of 
80% or more. Children in participating families 
were 20% more likely to attend pre-primary 
school than non-participants (Wong et al., 2013).

It is not simply a matter of costs: pre-primary 
schooling needs to be appealing to parents 
and children. Ghana is making great efforts to 
sensitize people to the need for pre-primary 
education that is friendly to young children. 
Its New Education Strategic Plan 2010–2020 
mandates an extensive multimedia public 
awareness campaign aimed at ‘rebranding’ 
kindergarten to make families and communities 
aware of the need for child-friendly pre-primary 
provision. The plan aims to further boost 
demand by addressing constraints on quality 
relating to teacher training, infrastructure, 
appropriate curriculum and support for special 
needs education (Shaeffer, 2015).

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 11025Education for All Global Monitoring Reportand broadcast spots targeting parents, guardians, 
newlyweds, pregnant women, teachers, child 
care providers, medical staff, and community and 
local leaders. Extensive coverage through ECCE 
centres and more formal kindergartens in rural 
and urban areas has achieved attendance by 
nearly 93% of 4- and 5-year-olds (Shaeffer, 2015).

Private sector involvement remains high

Despite government commitment under  
EFA to expand ECCE ‘especially for the most 
vulnerable and disadvantaged’, private sector 
enrolment has been rising in a number of 
countries. This leads to two problems. Where 
access depends on paying fees, many of the 
poorest are left behind. And private providers are 
highly unlikely to locate to sparsely populated 
and remote areas, so reliance on private 
provision can reduce educational and social 
equity for poor and remote populations. For the 
100 countries with data for both 1999 and 2012, 
the average percentage of private enrolment 
at the pre-primary level increased from 28% 
to almost 31%.4

‘Private schools’ make up a complicated and 
diverse sector, including purely private providers 
operating for profit or not for profit; NGOs and 
voluntary groups; and faith-based organizations 
(Ashley et al., 2014). In the Statistical Table in 
the Annex (3B), the distinction between public 
and private is based on whether a provider is 
government or privately owned. In reality, any 
private provider under this definition may receive 
funding from government or from philanthropic 
and faith-based groups, though most commonly 
charge user fees. Many governments have 
arrived at public–private partnerships, usually 
involving state funding for private provision, 
though often with some fees as well. But in 
many contexts, both provision and funding are 
left up to the non-state sector. This is the case 
in Ethiopia, Sierra Leone and many of the Arab 
States, where, as a result, pre-primary education 
tends to reach only more advantaged urban 
populations. Sierra Leone has a gross enrolment 
ratio of only 9% (Annex, Statistical Table 3B).

4. These numbers reflect only schools registered with the government. 
However, there are many unregistered private schools largely unaccounted 
for in official statistics or quality assurance (Woodhead and Streuli, 2013). 
This means official statistics in many countries under-represent actual 
enrolment, both overall and in the private sector.

Some countries experienced great change 
in the share of private pre-primary provision 
between 1999 and 2012 (Figure 1.9). Several 
poorer countries made progress in increasing 
public provision, while richer countries generally 
appeared to be reducing it. However, a reduction 
or increase in involvement of the private sector 
did not dictate whether parents paid more or 
less for pre-primary schooling. Sweden’s private 
enrolment rose as a result of a government 
school choice policy as indicated by enrolments 
by sector, yet parents pay no pre-primary 
fees (Sweden Government, 2012). The United 
Kingdom saw the most dramatic increase 
in private provision: sixfold growth over the 
period, to 37% of all enrolment in 2012 (Annex, 
Statistical Table 3B). The cost to parents could 
be substantial, though free, government funded 
places in early education were available to poor 
families (Mathers and Smees, 2014).

Governments have not done enough to expand 
access as they committed to do in 2000, but 
there is relatively high demand for private 
services. The private sector is extremely 
heterogeneous, ranging from the elite to low 
cost slum schools. In low and lower middle 
income countries, many low cost private schools 
operate in conditions so poor that they do not 
stand a chance of government registration. They 
often employ unqualified staff and never engage 
with the government for fear of closure over 
lack of compliance, as in Nigeria (Härmä, 2011). 
In the United Kingdom, many poor children are 
being failed by low quality, lower cost private 
pre-primary facilities that tend to cluster in 
areas of deprivation. Such centres were found 
to employ many fewer graduate and upper-
secondary-educated staff, resulting in poorer 
learning outcomes, while centres serving more 
affluent areas were generally of better quality 
(Mathers and Smees, 2014).

Public–private partnerships can expand access 
and may improve quality

In a time of budget constraints, many countries 
choose to engage with the private sector through 
partnerships where government pays all or part 
of the fee for a child to attend a non-government 
school. This can expand access and can put 
positive pressure on quality standards in areas 
where private schooling is viable, particularly 
urban areas. Partnering with private providers is

not usually an option in very remote and sparsely 
populated areas where there are insufficient 
numbers of children.

Hong Kong (China) is encouraging improvement 
in the quality of ECCE teaching. All ECCE 
provision is private, but parents receive vouchers 
to use at non-profit centres. For a school 
to participate in the voucher programme, 
all its teachers must have a certificate in 
early childhood education, and all newly 
appointed principals must have an academic 
degree in early childhood education (Poon, 
2008; Ying, 2013).

In other countries, both quality and participation 
are encouraged at the same time. In Mauritius, 
the government provides cash transfers 
conditional on children’s enrolment at age 4, and 
it provides quality assurance for private centres 
(World Bank, 2012c). This has resulted in a gross 

enrolment ratio of 120% in 2012 from 94% in 
1999 (Annex, Statistical Table 3B). In Singapore, 
the government provides assistance to low-
income families (Karuppiah, n.d.). In South Africa 
the government pays for children to attend 
private centres; to boost both participation and 
quality, schools must be registered and join 
government monitoring and support systems, a 
requirement of which is that staff meet minimum 
qualifications (Biersteker, 2013). In Uganda, the 
government plans to introduce a small monthly 
per-child subsidy to ECCE centres, conditional 
on meeting minimum standards and complying 
with the curriculum (van Ravens, 2014), to 
support implementation of the Education Sector 
Early Childhood Development Policy 2007.

In some countries, such as Chile and Sweden, 
governments have an established history of 
providing pre-primary schooling and yet make 
the policy decision to introduce school choice 

66

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 11025Education for All Global Monitoring Reportby providing the same payment per pupil to 
whatever school a parent chooses (Woodhead 
and Streuli, 2013). Such policies have run for 
34 years in Chile and 22 years in Sweden, yet 
there is continuing debate on the effectiveness 
of school choice where government provision 
already exists.

Systems run in parallel, not in partnership

In some contexts, parallel pre-primary education 
systems have emerged: those privately provided 
alongside government ones (Box 1.6). A recent 
study following children in 362 villages in 
three Indian States showed that while 85% 

of children in Assam attend government 
Anganwadis, only 52% did in Andhra Pradesh 
and 20% in Rajasthan. Meanwhile, about 30% 
attend private schools in Andhra Pradesh and 
40% in Rajasthan, reflecting the enormous 
growth in private pre-primary schools across 
rural, urban and tribal areas (Centre for Early 
Childhood Education and Development, 2013; 
Manji et al., 2015). In China, urban children 
take advantage of relatively well-equipped 
government centres staffed with trained 
teachers, while many rural communities rely on 
private kindergartens staffed by untrained local 
women (Rao et al., 2012b). In Brazil, private and 
government schools exist in parallel, although

Box 1.6: Low cost private provision dominates in areas of sub-Saharan Africa

Demand in urban sub-Saharan Africa is strong, with 71% 
to 93% of 3- to 6-year-olds enrolled in four locations. 
Pre-primary schooling, whether government or private, is 
expensive, with total costs representing a considerable 
proportion of GDP per capita per month for each child in the 
household (Table 2). In sampled neighbourhoods of Accra, 
Lagos, Nairobi and Johannesburg, private schools cater to 
the vast majority of enrolled children. Parents are highly 
motivated and seek early learning opportunities rather than 
simple child minding.

The quality of provision is a concern. Pedagogy and subject 
content are often age-inappropriate. In Accra and Nairobi, 
schools are a downward extension of schooling, with rows of 
desks where children begin literacy and numeracy learning. 
Home languages are not often used or included as a lesson 
subject. In Nairobi, classes are teacher-led, children as young 
as 3 or 4 sit for exams, and ranked accordingly.

For high quality ECCE provision, teachers need a good 
general education, as well as specific early childhood 
training. In Nairobi and Lagos, most teachers tend to have 

some tertiary study and sometimes a full degree, and 61% 
in Lagos had some education-specific training. Only 40% 
of teachers in Accra, and none in Lagos, had specific early 
childhood training.

The case of South Africa stands out in several respects.  
The government provides one year of pre-primary  
education – the ‘reception year’ or ‘Grade R’. Grade R 
provision has considerable reach, at least in urban  
Soweto, where 80% of children aged 5 to 6 are enrolled,  
74% of them in government schools. However, access for 
younger children is only possible through private schools  
and is highly correlated with income levels, with only  
60% of children aged 3 to 4 enrolled. Private centres are 
more child-friendly than in the other three countries – with 
small group settings, learning through play and use of home 
language. These examples show that the great demand in 
sub-Saharan Africa for ECCE is not being met by the meagre 
government supply.

GOAL 1: EARLY CHILDHOOD CARE AND EDUCATIONPre-primary education systems and enrolment levels have expanded rapidly in some countriesprivate schools have the minority share (Bastos 
and Straume, 2013). Despite Peru’s free and 
compulsory pre-primary schooling, the private 
sector has developed in parallel, particularly 
in urban areas, and mainly serving better off 
families. Private growth in Peru has been 
substantial: in 1998 the ratio of public to private 
provision was 4:1, but ten years later it had 
become nearly equal at 1.5:1 (Woodhead and 
Streuli, 2013).

In other contexts, government is establishing 
systems where once only the private sector 
existed. Although Jordan had 4,127 private 
kindergartens as of 2010, it opened 532 public 
kindergartens between 2003 and 2010 as part of 
the 2003 Education Reform for the Knowledge 
Economy (Al-Hassan et al., 2010; UNICEF, 2008). 
Jordan’s achievement is dwarfed by Algeria’s 
expansion of its government provision, resulting 
in a 77 percentage point increase in GER to 
reach 79% by 2014 (Annex, Statistical Table 3B).

The quest for quality is yet to be 
meaningfully addressed

Improving access is not enough: the quality of 
pre-primary schooling is crucial to ensure that 
children develop to their potential and are ready 
for school (Yoshikawa and Kabay, 2015). Children 
who do not receive a good quality education are 
less likely to succeed in primary school (Barnett, 
2008). While even relatively poor provision brings 
some benefits, the better the quality, the greater 
the gain. This has been found in Bangladesh and 
Cambodia (Rao et al., 2012a) and England (United 
Kingdom) (Sylva et al., 2011), in both urban 
and rural areas. In England (United Kingdom), 
the positive effects of attending a lower quality 
programme had begun to fade by age 11, while 
effects were enduring for children who attended 
higher quality programmes (Sylva et al., 2011). 
But defining quality is a challenging task, involving 
questions of curriculum, pedagogy, culture and, 
crucially, the skill of pre-primary teachers.

Curriculum, pedagogy and culture all influence 
the quality of pre-primary schooling

Quality is a relative, value-laden and dynamic 
concept. What the language of instruction should 
be – mother tongue versus a national or colonial 
language – and whether to accommodate 
cultural perceptions and religious practices are 

questions on which pedagogical and parental 
views may land on opposite sides (Shaeffer, 
2015). A broad base of research suggests 
several crucial, mutually reinforcing factors 
in quality: inputs (including a safe and healthy 
environment), organization and management 
(strong leadership), the educational process 
(including opportunities for learning through 
experience), and warm and responsive 
relationships among educators and children, 
parents and the community (Myers, 2004).

Curriculum shapes what children should learn 
while pedagogy refers to how they are taught 
or their learning is facilitated; these aspects 
of education are closely linked (Sheridan et al., 
2009), with curriculum helping shape pedagogy. 
In addition, parents’ cultural perceptions may 
lead to pressure on schools to do things a 
certain way. Many countries recognize that 
the pre-primary classroom needs to be child-
centred and developmentally appropriate in 
terms of both curriculum and culture, allowing 
much time for play. This need is also inextricably 
linked with the setting. The environment should 
support learning activities shaped by teachers, 
and include a safe space for children to play 
and explore, and materials and learning toys for 
children to interact with.

Many poor countries are far from being able to 
provide pre-primary schools with the necessary 
resources, making effective curricula and 
pedagogies such as HighScope, from the United 
States (HighScope, n.d.), highly challenging to 
replicate. UNICEF has devised a kit of basic 
materials for early childhood learning in crisis 
situations (UNICEF, 2013a). Similar tools could 
be developed for use in non-crisis but low-
resource settings, to go with a set curriculum.

India, Jamaica, Kazakhstan and Tajikistan offer 
examples of how countries have improved 
curriculum and pedagogy for ECCE. India’s new 
Early Childhood Education Curriculum Framework 
takes a developmental approach, with different 
activities for age groups 3 to 4 and 4 to 6.  
For the younger children, these include planned  
and free play and interactions: adult–child 
and child–child, individually and in small and 
large groups. Children have ‘opportunities to 
listen to stories, learn rhymes, create, indulge 
in imaginative play, ask questions, do simple 
problem solving, experiment to promote active

“feel good” experience for a positive self-image.’ 
For the older group, there is an increasing 
ratio of adult-guided rather than free play 
activities and more large-group work. Achieving 
school readiness includes matching pictures 
with sounds, recognizing shapes, broadening 
vocabulary and developing affinity with reading 
through picture books and storytelling, as well 
as writing and learning arithmetic, including 
number and space concepts. The curriculum also 
includes activities to develop fine motor skills, 
physical coordination and fitness, as well as 
creativity through drama, music and more (India 
Government, 2012).

Jamaica similarly separates curriculum by age 
(0 to 3 and 4 to 5 years), with curricular elements 
broadly similar to India’s (Jamaica Government 
and Dudley Grant Memorial Trust, 2008). 
Kazakhstan, like many other countries, has 
reformed its curriculum using the ‘Step by Step’ 
system to provide a more child-centred approach 
focusing on holistic development, including 
emotional and cognitive elements (UNESCO, 
2005c). Tajikistan, with the support of UNICEF 
and the Aga Khan Foundation, approved a new 
curriculum for alternative or community-based 
early childhood provision in June 2013, also 
using child-centred approaches. The curriculum 
will be applied in classrooms with teachers 
trained in the new methods (UNICEF, 2013f).

Altering pre-primary models to suit the cultural 
context can boost demand. The success of this 
approach in Kenya, Uganda and the United 
Republic of Tanzania (Yoshikawa and Kabay, 2015) 
demonstrates that in education, no one size fits 
all. The East African Madrasa Early Childhood 
Programme has brought more children into 
school in countries where the religious aspect 
of life is considered of fundamental importance 
(Manji et al., 2015). In Cambodia, a home-
based programme has proved responsive and 
adaptable to local cultural variation through 
relevant methods, language, materials and 
norms (Yoshikawa and Kabay, 2015).

In contrast to these approaches, parents’ 
cultural expectation of schools may be that 
formal book learning should start at as  
early an age as possible (O’Gara, 2013). In Hong 
Kong (China), pre-schools tend to focus on how 
to prepare a child academically for primary 

school (Fung and Lam, 2012). In Thailand, 
parents feel pre-primary schools should provide 
an ‘early primary education’; they do not fully 
understand the more child-friendly offering in 
pre-primary centres (Shaeffer, 2015). Similar 
misunderstanding took place in Jharkhand 
state, India, where a child-centred, play-
based pre-primary curriculum was piloted 
(Pattanayak, 2012).

The response of the government in Thailand, and 
also in Ghana, was to use public sensitization 
campaigns to instil parental understanding of 
pedagogy friendly to young children. The state 

Pre-primary

Box 1.7: Children and schools should be 
ready for each other

‘School readiness’ has several aspects: how prepared 
a child is to transition from the home or pre-primary 
environment to the formal primary school classroom, 
how well the family has been able to support the child’s 
learning from birth (sometimes with assistance from 
home visiting programmes) and how ready schools are to 
help the child with a smooth transition.

The readiness of the child is perhaps the most important 
aspect of school readiness. Children should have 
basic behaviours and abilities, including pre-literacy 
and numeracy, the ability to follow directions, and the 
ability to focus on a particular learning activity for a 
given period. They also need a level of socio-emotional 
development which allows them to regulate their 
behaviour and emotions. It is the role of the pre-primary 
school, as well as the family, to ensure that children are 
ready to make the transition to school.

Due to a lack of coordinated planning across the 
primary and pre-primary levels, many programmes focus 
on readying children for primary school rather than 
providing and supporting a smooth transition between 
the two levels. Curricula and pedagogy should be jointly 
designed to eliminate disjuncture between the levels, 
with education planners cognisant of the definition of 
early childhood as lasting until age 8, meaning that early 
childhood pedagogy and curriculum approaches should 
be used in the first one to three years of primary school, 
depending on the start age for the primary level. While it 
may be accepted that more play-focused and learning-
through-doing techniques are appropriate for pre-primary 
classrooms, when children enter the first grade classroom 
they are often expected immediately to sit at a desk and 
behave in a more constrained and formal manner.

GOAL 1: EARLY CHILDHOOD CARE AND EDUCATIONPre-primary education systems and enrolment levels have expanded rapidly in some countriesBox 1.8: Culture shapes assessment of 
indigenous education in Mexico

An evaluation process being piloted in two states of 
Mexico to assess the quality of indigenous pre-primary 
education demonstrates the importance of culture in 
assessing quality of teaching. Working with school 
supervisors, community members reflect upon the world 
in which they want to live, then negotiate a definition 
of quality. Indicators of school and classroom quality 
are determined, and supervisors use them in observing 
classrooms, on the premise that a good quality pre-
primary classroom and experience should be consistent 
with the reflection process. The supervisors provide 
evidence about the school and classroom process to 
the director and teachers. Then those involved reflect 
together on the evidence to identify actions to improve 
the quality of ECCE provision. Supervisors make periodic 
visits thereafter to monitor improvement.

What indigenous Mexicans consider important indicators 
of quality are reflected in the way they assess quality, 
with respect for how culture shapes education and a wish 
to ensure that indicators are relevant to culture and context. 
The process has reportedly resulted in improved quality, 
both in general and with respect to the added dimension 
of culture.

government of Jharkhand engaged in more 
grass-roots efforts to convince parents of the 
importance of using age-appropriate pedagogy 
(Pattanayak, 2012). Despite such efforts, families 
and children may be ill-prepared for the abrupt 
transition from pre-primary to primary if 
coordination is lacking (Box 1.7).

Assessing good quality teaching is as 
complicated as defining it. Observation of the 
classroom process is best, but is painstaking  
and skill-intensive. Context is extremely 
important, and for an assessment to be used 
to improve quality of service provision, all key 
stakeholders should work collaboratively. A 
Mexican initiative shows how taking account of 
culture can have positive effects on the quality 
of ECCE provision when results are fed back into 
the education system (Box 1.8).

and relationships. They are one of the biggest 
school-related factors (Sheridan et al., 2009), 
and their professional qualifications influence 
the quality of classroom interaction more 
than the physical setting and resourcing do 
(Mtahabwa and Rao, 2010).

These findings are generally not reflected in 
national practice, where many ECCE teachers 
are inadequately prepared. Poorly prepared 
teachers struggle to use the kind of curricula 
adopted by India and Jamaica, discussed 
above. In addition, as these curricula can prove 
material-intensive, teacher training needs 
to address the making and maintenance of 
materials from the local environment. 

Hand in hand with lack of teacher preparation 
are poor working conditions of ECCE teachers. 
Young children are often assigned the least 
effective teachers due to the low status attached 
to this schooling level (O’Gara, 2013). Untrained 
and unqualified staff are often employed, and 
the low status and pay are linked with high 
staff turnover, damaging learning outcomes 
(Mathers et al., 2014). Lower status and pay of 
ECCE teachers are commonly built into salary 
scales (ILO, 2014a), so that the teachers’ living 
conditions can be poor (Sun et al., 2015). The 
private sector in particular tends to pay teachers 
as little as possible to keep costs down (Sun et 
al., 2015). Teaching pre-primary and the lower 
primary grades is also widely feminized in both 
developed and developing countries (Kelleher, 
2011), because traditionally the care of young 
children is seen as women’s work. In many 
countries, this translates to lower pay and less 
professionalization and respect (Kelleher, 2011). 
All these factors make it difficult to attract highly 
qualified ECCE teachers.

However, it is possible to improve conditions: 
the Republic of Moldova doubled salaries 
between 2002 and 2008, while Australia, China 
and Singapore offer special incentives for ECCE 
teachers. Australia, New Zealand, Portugal and 
the United Kingdom are taking steps towards pay 
parity for teachers at all levels (ILO, 2012b).

Teachers are the main determinants of quality, 
but many are inadequately prepared

Preparing pre-primary teachers is key to 
increasing quality in both classroom process 

Another issue concerning the quality of teaching 
is inequity between school locations. It is a 
challenge to get trained ECCE teachers to 
work in poor, rural and otherwise difficult-to-
reach communities (Sun et al., 2015). These are

generally less attractive postings, but  
measures can be taken to address this issue. 
In Australia and China, teachers are given 
incentives to take rural hardship postings  
(Sun et al., 2015). In Brazil, large differences in 
opportunity for good quality ECCE are related  
to urban versus rural residence, community 
and ethnic divisions, and the unevenness of 
government commitment and investment 
in the sector (Sun et al., 2015). In response, 
the government initiated a public–private 
partnership with the Mauricio Sirotsky Sobrinha 
Foundation and UNESCO in 2003 to provide 
in-service training. It promotes and raises the 
status and self-esteem of teachers through 
professional support mechanisms, opportunities 
to learn from each other in communities of 
practice, and general awareness-raising on  
the importance of pre-primary schooling  
(Sun et al., 2015).

Many countries increased the share of trained 
teachers in pre-primary education between 
1999 and 2012. Relatively few countries with 
data experienced a decline in their numbers. 
Being ‘qualified’ on paper does not guarantee 

that a teacher has actually had high quality 
professional development. Nevertheless, data 
on numbers of trained teachers and ratios of 
pupils to trained teachers are among the proxy 
measures of ECCE quality. Among countries 
with data, low income countries are less likely 
to have the resources to invest in training and 
therefore have a low share of trained teachers 
(Figure 1.10). In most middle income countries, 
a majority of pre-primary school teachers are 
trained. However, some countries have expanded 
their teaching force with untrained candidates. 
Several of the countries where the proportion 
of trained teachers has shrunk are poor, fragile 
and conflict-affected including Eritrea, Mali and 
Sierra Leone.

Policies for teacher training and minimum 
qualifications are needed

To achieve quality in ECCE, teachers must receive 
the high quality training necessary to fulfil 
required qualifications, and the requirements 
must be adhered to. Countries are increasingly 
defining clear requirements for education and 
training for pre-primary teachers and have

GOAL 1: EARLY CHILDHOOD CARE AND EDUCATIONPre-primary education systems and enrolment levels have expanded rapidly in some countriesbecome considerably more stringent since 2000. 
However, many are yet to formalize minimum 
standards for pre-primary teachers. In Brazil, 
there is only a set of ‘recommended’ minimum 
qualifications (Bastos and Straume, 2013).

In Kenya, ECCE teachers used to be accepted 
even with incomplete primary school education, 
but now teachers must have passed lower 
secondary school examinations and have specific 
ECCE training. Private sector institutes have 
stepped in to fill the gap in terms of demand 
for this training, yet even they face difficulties 
in ensuring that their staff meets minimum 
requirements (Manji et al., 2015).

Colombian regulations require teachers to 
have tertiary education as well as direct ECCE 
experience, while workers in family and home-
based programmes are required to have a 
university degree as well as ECCE experience 
(World Bank, 2013b).

Singapore is a regional leader in training for 
early childhood professionals (Vargas-Barón, 
2014). Its Preschool Qualification Accreditation 
Committee developed a framework for early 
childhood educator training and accredited 
training courses starting in 2001, and more 
stringent requirements were added in 2013  
(Sun et al., 2015).

In the United Republic of Tanzania, required 
qualifications for teaching vary by children’s 
ages. For the pre-primary level, teachers must 
complete secondary education as well as two 
years of full-time teacher training, though 
classroom practice is not incorporated (World 
Bank, 2012c). For those caring for children 
aged 2 to 4, a complete secondary education 
is required, as well as annual training of 40 
hours, covering health and cognitive, social and 
emotional development (World Bank, 2012c). 
Nigeria has a similar scale of requirements 
(World Bank, 2013d).

In-service professional development is 
an important adjunct to training, and the 
importance of teachers having regular 
opportunities for it cannot be overstated. 
Evidence from Kenya shows that older teachers 
lose skills over time due to lack of in-service 
training (Ngware et al., 2013).

China’s planned approach (Box 1.9) offers a 
variety of strategies to meet the demand for 
trained ECCE teachers, particularly in rural  
and remote areas.

Box 1.9: China takes a planned approach to early childhood teacher development

Integrating early childhood education into the national 
development plan for education, China has worked hard 
at the national and regional levels to improve the quality 
of and access to pre-primary schooling, particularly in rural 
areas. It has focused on teachers’ professional development, 
including redeployment and retraining. In 2008, there 
were more than twice as many pupils per qualified ECCE 
teacher in rural areas as there were in towns and cities. It 
was extremely difficult to recruit trained teachers for rural 
and remote postings because of low job status and low pay, 
among other reasons.

One strategy to address this was to retrain primary and 
secondary school teachers in early childhood education as 
demand for their previous training declined due to the long-
term effects of a falling birth rate. Funds have been available 

since 2011 to provide in-service training to principals and 
teachers, including from the private sector, who formerly 
taught in primary and secondary schools. To meet increased 
need, more teacher training institutes are planned for most 
regions. Different types of training have been devised, 
including short-term intensive training, professional 
retraining and three month programmes of full-time and 
intensive training.

Teachers are also given incentives to work in remote rural 
areas, such as payment of their teacher training course 
fees as well as monetary incentives. In addition, national 
legislation has been enacted to raise ECCE teacher salaries. 
These moves will help raise the status of the profession and 
attract more new entrants.

and emotional 
development of 
the young child 

Conclusions

Supporting children’s development at the 
earliest stages has an enormous impact in 
terms of better educational and wider societal 
outcomes. The highest economic returns to 
investment in education are currently at the early 
childhood stage. The fact that less advantaged 
communities, particularly in poorer countries, 
gain even greater benefits is an additional key 
argument for investing heavily at this level. 
Increased social and economic equity can 
result from building stronger foundations. 
Since Dakar, progress has been achieved in the 
number of children worldwide accessing ECCE 
programmes through a range of services. 

A key lesson is that children require more than a 
pre-primary education before they enter school. 
It is crucial that support to child development 
start at the earliest possible age. Multiple 
sectors need to be involved to support the health 
and nutrition, as well as the cognitive, social 
and emotional development of the young child. 
It is a great challenge to ensure that each of 
these sectors reaches each and every child, but 
countries in vastly different contexts are proving 
that it can be done. 

Yet children from marginalized groups are still 
denied access due to lack of funds, structural 
inequity and lack of attention to issues of quality. 
In many countries, families must fund ECCE, 
particularly where it is left entirely to the private 
sector, translating to inequitable access and 
overall underprovision. This is because many poor 
families cannot afford to pay fees, meaning less 
demand for ECCE services. To increase demand 
and ensure equitable access, provision should be 
funded by government or families provided with 
a cash transfer to pay the necessary fees.

Not enough has been done to ensure that 
the quality of provision, particularly related 
to teachers and teaching, is improved along 
with access. Many of these issues mirror the 
challenges found in primary education, as the 
next chapter discusses. Lessons for ECCE 
can be learned from observing the challenges 
involved in expansion of primary education. 
And getting it right at the early childhood 
stage will lessen many of the issues related to 
having to ‘catch up’ that school systems and 
their stakeholders face at the primary level 
and far beyond.

CHAPTER X Goal X: Early childhood care and educationHighlights ■Despite a drop in child mortality rates of nearly 50%, 6.3 million children under the age of 5 died from causes that are mostly preventable in 2013. ■Progress in improving child nutrition has been considerable. Yet globally, 1 in 4 children are still short for their age – a sign of chronic deficiency in essential nutrients. ■In 2012, 184 million children were enrolled in pre-primary education worldwide, an increase of nearly two-thirds since 1999. ■Governments have committed to expand pre-primary education but private providers still account for one-third of all enrolled children worldwide. ■By 2014, 40 countries had implemented compulsory pre-primary education. In several Latin American countries, this led to a steady improvement in the enrolment of pre-primary aged children. ■The quality of childcare for very young children remains a serious issue. The knowledge, skills, status and pay for early childhood teachers must be addressed.Highlights ■Primary adjusted net enrolment ratios improved significantly, rising at least 20 percentage points from 1999 to 2012 in 17 countries, 11 of which were from sub-Saharan Africa. ■While some increases in enrolment ratios are evident, nearly 58 million children were out of school in 2012, and progress in reducing this number has stalled since 2007. ■Despite progress, dropout remains an issue: in 32 countries, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa, at least 20% of children enrolled in primary school are not likely to reach the last grade. ■Even though disparities in education access have declined in most countries, millions of children continue to lack access to education because of disadvantages such as poverty, gender, location and ethnicity. ■Abolishing school fees was a politically popular initiative that helped attract students, yet families can still pay significant amounts for their children’s education.  ■So that all children can access education, major efforts must be made to prioritize disadvantaged and marginalized children in the next decade. This is particularly so for the millions of children with disabilities and those living in complex emergency situations, and more must be done to identify these children.1025Universal primary education ..........77

Improvements in access to education 
are one of the leading successes 
of the EFA movement. This chapter 
monitors progress in achieving the 
goal of universal primary education 
by 2015. It reviews policies to increase 
primary school access such as fee 
abolition, school construction and 
cash transfer programmes. However, 
millions of children are excluded from 
primary education due to factors such 
as poverty, ethnicity, language and 
disability. The chapter also describes 
the impact of complex emergencies 
and armed conflict on education. 

India has successfully moved towards reaching the EFA goals, especially in 
ensuring near Universal Elementary Education and enrolment of girls. India’s 
efforts have been backed by the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory 
Education Act, 2009 and the national Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan programme. To 
ensure continued participation of girls in education, Beti Bachao Beti Padhao 
(Save the Girl, Educate the Girl) initiative has recently been launched in India.”

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALL1025Education for All Global Monitoring Report  Goal 2    Universal primary education

Ensuring that by 2015 all children, particularly girls, children in difficult 
circumstances and those belonging to ethnic minorities, have access to, and 
complete, free and compulsory primary education of good quality.

Universal primary education was the most 
prominent of the Education for All (EFA) goals, 
as reflected by its inclusion in the Millennium 
Development Goals. It has been well funded, 
politically supported and extensively monitored; 
the popular appeal of providing access to 
education for all is clear. Despite this, it will  
not be realized by 2015.

the demand and supply of education support 
this goal. An important supply-side 
development since Dakar has been the 
proliferation of education programmes provided 
by the private sector and by community, non-
formal and religious schools that meet the 
demands for education provision as well as 
desires of parents.

What have countries achieved since the 
World Education Forum in 2000 and the 
resulting Dakar Framework for Action? This 
chapter addresses four questions to examine 
what progress has been made towards the 
achievement of the goal, what has been done 
to accomplish this progress, which countries 
or populations have been successful or left 
behind, and why.

A stocktaking of country achievements since 
Dakar shows significant increases in the number 
of children who entered and participated in 
primary school, accompanied by a reduction 
in the percentage of children who have never 
been to school, though success has varied in 
reducing the rural–urban gap for these children. 
Challenges to reach universal primary education 
include large out-of-school populations; primary 
completion, especially for their poorest people; 
and better progression through the primary 
school cycle.

Key factors contributing to universal primary 
education include abolishing school fees; 
increasing demand for education through 
initiatives such as cash transfers, school 
feeding programmes and take-home rations; 
and increasing the supply of schools and 
classrooms, as well as investing in health 
and infrastructure. 

The first part of this chapter of the EFA Global 
Monitoring Report (GMR) provides an overall 
assessment of success towards universal 
primary education before examining how the 
factors described above of increasing both 

The second part of the chapter describes 
the key theme of reaching the marginalized. 
Without success in this area, universal primary 
education will never be possible. Improvements 
are needed to reach the poorest populations, 
ethnic and linguistic minorities, working 
children, nomadic communities, children 
affected by HIV and AIDS, slum dwellers and 
children with disabilities. The chapter ends 
with an examination of the evolving challenge 
of providing education in complex emergencies, 
an issue that has taken on greater visibility 
and mobilization in recent years and for which 
challenges remain.

Monitoring progress

Despite significant progress, the goal of 
universal primary education by 2015 has not 
been met and even the limited aspiration of 
getting all children into school is unfulfilled. 
In 2012, nearly 58 million children of primary 
school age (typically between 6 and 11 years of 
age) were not enrolled in school. The reasons 
include demographic pressures, conflict 
situations, and a lack of adequate commitment 
in certain countries with large out-of-school 
populations, such as Nigeria and Pakistan. 
The marginalization of certain socio-economic

The closer countries get to reaching the goal, 
the harder it becomes to make substantial

GOAL 2: UNIVERSAL PRIMARY EDUCATIONMonitoring progressattending school. Even relatively well-targeted 
programmes, such as Brazil’s Bolsa Familia, do 
not fully cover the extremely poor and therefore 
do not address their challenges (Garcia-
Jaramillo and Maranti, 2015).

While school entry and enrolment are a 
continued priority, efforts to address the issues 
of quality, age-appropriate entry and schooling 
costs have not matched need. As a result, 
significant problems persist with dropout, 
progression and completion levels.

Official recognition of the millions of children 
living with disabilities and in complex 
emergencies remains an issue. The paucity of 
data concerning these children means the scale 
of the challenge is likely underestimated.

In spite of these challenges, some countries have 
clearly improved their education performance 
since Dakar. With a strong commitment to 
universalizing education, countries including 
Burundi, Ethiopia, Morocco, Mozambique, 
Nepal and the United Republic of Tanzania 
achieved substantial, albeit uneven, progress 
on several indicators of primary schooling such 
as reducing gender and income disparities in 
school access, net enrolment ratios and primary 
attainment rates.

The experiences of Nepal, Rwanda and Sierra 
Leone suggest that countries can rise from 
conflict situations and greatly improve their 
education systems. Sierra Leone began its slow 
climb out of an 11 year political conflict and saw 
substantial improvement in education after 2005.

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 21025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportLatin American countries, such as the 
Plurinational State of Bolivia, Guatemala, 
Nicaragua and Suriname, have made 
tremendous progress in reducing the number of 
poor children who have never been to school.

As discussed in the chapter, different policies to 
achieve progress included increasing education 
expenditure while abolishing fees, investing 
in school construction and improving their 
emphasis on equity. Especially in Latin American 
countries, improvements are likely attributable 
to school incentive programmes, including cash 
transfers, as well as curricular reforms targeted 
to indigenous populations. Many countries 
have also introduced reforms of governance, 
curriculum and teaching to enhance education 
quality (see Chapter 6) which may have helped 
completion rates.

There were substantial improvements in 
net enrolment ratios

Primary adjusted net enrolment, a key indicator 
to monitor universal primary education, has 
remained relatively high for many high income 
countries in North America and Western Europe, 
East Asia and the Pacific, and Central and Eastern 
Europe and Central Asia in the years since Dakar. 
Among the countries with data, 17 increased net 
enrolment ratios by over 20 percentage points 
between 1999 and 2012 (Figure 2.1). In the Arab 
States, Morocco’s net enrolment ratio increased 
from 71% in 1999 to universal primary enrolment 
(99%) in 2013, a gain due to a long-term emphasis 
on school construction in rural areas and gender 
equity reforms (World Bank, 2005, 2013). Bhutan, 
the Lao People’s Democratic Republic and 
Nepal provide examples of stellar improvement

GOAL 2: UNIVERSAL PRIMARY EDUCATIONMonitoring progressBurundi 
increased its 
net enrolment 
rate from 41% 
in 2000 to 94 
% in 2010

in net enrolment ratios in Asia. In Latin 
America, El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua 
increased their net enrolment ratios by over 10 
percentage points. Other countries, mainly in sub-
Saharan Africa, achieved considerable progress 
even if primary enrolment is still far from 
universal. Burundi stands out: its net enrolment 
ratio increased from less than 41% in 2000 to 
94% in 2010. Net enrolment ratios increased 
from 27% to almost 64% in Niger and from 42% 
to 76% in Guinea. A significant accomplishment 
is demonstrated by steady increases in net 
enrolment ratios even in some countries that 
experienced significant population growth. For 
example, in Burkina Faso and Mozambique the 
school age population grew by 50% or more 
between 1999 and 2012, and net enrolment ratios 
simultaneously increased by over 66%. 

Trend projections, with further details in Chapter 
7, Projections, indicate that of the 140 countries 
with available data, only 73 countries will 
achieve universal primary enrolment (that is, 
adjusted net enrolment ratios of at least 97%) 
by 2015. Most of these countries are located 
in North America and Western Europe and 
Latin America and the Caribbean. Among the 
67 countries that will not reach the target, 13, 

mainly from sub-Saharan Africa, will be far from 
the goal with  net enrolment ratios below 80%. 

Enrolling a child at the appropriate age at the 
beginning of primary education is another 
measure of progress. Over-age students face 
pressure to begin working and generating 
income, which can lead to dropout. They can 
also create difficult multi-age learning situations 
for teachers and other students (Lloyd, 2011; 
Wang, 2011). Late entry is a problem of equity as 
well, as it has a greater effect on disadvantaged 
children (UNESCO, 2012b). In Pakistan in 2012, 
50% of students from the poorest households 
and 15% from the richest, were two or more 
years older than the appropriate age in grade 1.

There has been some progress in enrolment of 
students at the appropriate age. The percentage 
of the grade 1 population two or more years 
above the appropriate age declined by over 
20 percentage points in Ethiopia and Haiti, 
and fell to a very low level in Peru (Figure 2.2). 
Age-appropriate entry is likely to have been 
incentivized by various policies, including 
the increase in early childhood development 
programmes (Engle et al., 2007), and cash 
transfer programs (Maluccio and Flores, 2005).

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 21025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportFor example, pre-primary gross enrolment 
ratios increased strikingly from 11% in 1999 
to 84% in 2013 in Nepal (see Chapter 1). 
These improvements in age-appropriate entry 
contribute substantial improvements to net 
primary enrolment ratios.

Fewer children have never been to school

Along with improvement in net enrolment 
ratios, the percentage of children who have 
never been to school fell in the vast majority 
of countries. Among countries where at least 
20% of children did not go to school in 2000, 
10 – Bangladesh, Burundi, Cambodia, the 
Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Haiti, 
Mozambique, Sierra Leone, Nepal and the 
United Republic of Tanzania – had more than 
halved the percentage by 2010. The percentage 
of children who had never been to school 
decreased by remarkable rates in Ethiopia (from 
67% in 2000 to 28% in 2011) and the United 
Republic of Tanzania (from 47% in 1999 to 12% 
in 2010) (Figure 2.3). Haiti made a significant 
recovery from a severe earthquake, food crisis 
and floods, more than halving the number of 
children who had never been to school between 
2000 and 2012. Improvements in going to school 
were particularly impressive in countries with 
continued and significant school age population 
growth, such as Burkina Faso, Mozambique and 
Sierra Leone, where it is harder to maintain the 
effort to bring all children into schools. 

Evaluating progress is not simple. A focus only on 
younger children may overestimate the percentage 
of children who never go to school, since many 
countries have significant over-age entry. In 
Zambia, 13% of those aged 9 to 12 had never been 
to school, but this was true of only 3.5% of those 
aged 12 to 15. Also, an evaluation of a country’s 
average progress masks internal disparities, such 
as the gap in rural and urban access to education.

Progress in reducing the rural–urban gap varies, 
though rural access to education generally 
improved as many countries reduced the distance 
to education in rural areas. Sierra Leone is an 
example where average progress in schooling 
intake was accompanied by a substantial 
reduction in rural disadvantage: the rural–urban 
gap in the percentage of children who had never 
been to school declined from about 31 percentage 
points (59% in rural areas, 27% in urban areas) 

in 2000 to about 8 percentage points (19% in 
rural areas, 11% in urban areas) in 2010. In other 
countries, the rural–urban gap persisted in spite 
of average improvements. Guinea saw only a 
slight reduction, from about 41 percentage points 
in 1999 (66% in rural areas, 25% in urban areas) to 
about 35 percentage points in 2012 (48% in rural 
areas, 13% in urban areas). In the worst example, 
rural access in Nigeria worsened between 2003 
and 2013, increasing rural–urban inequality.

Large out-of-school populations remain  
in some countries

The high-population countries, which had the 
largest numbers of out-of-school children in 
1999, continued to have very high out-of-school 
populations in 2012 (UNESCO, 2014g). Some 
of the smaller countries that have more than 
800,000 children out of school, such as Burkina 
Faso, Niger, South Sudan and Sudan, are 
affected by conflict or are extremely poor.

The progress in the large countries has been 
quite different. India made marked progress, 
increasing its net enrolment ratio significantly 
as GNP per capita improved, suggesting a more 
equitable distribution of economic gains. By 
contrast, Nigeria and Pakistan have made far 
less progress than would be expected given their 
initial starting points on enrolment ratios and 
current per capita income. Nigeria has lacked 
progress in nearly all education indicators. And 
between 1999 and 2012, even though Nigeria’s 
GNP per capita grew substantially, the progress 
in its adjusted net enrolment ratio and out-of-
school population nearly stalled. In Pakistan, 
despite some reduction in the percentage of 
out-of-school children, household survey data 
suggest entrenched inequalities. 

What sets Nigeria and Pakistan apart from 
other post-colonial countries is their size, their 
geopolitical importance and the complexity 
and frequency of ethnic and religious strife. 
Democracy is also weak. Neither country has 
been able to develop a unified voice of civil 
society, with organizations instead divided along 
ethnic, kinship or religious lines (Ejiogu, 2011; 
Ukiwo, 2003; Wilkinson, 2000). The political 
leadership, civilian or military, has been 
identified as corrupt, stealing the vast oil wealth 
in Nigeria or pilfering public funds and post- 
9/11 aid funds in Pakistan (Agbiboa, 2012; Khan, 

India increased 
its net enrolment 
ratio as GNP per 
capita improved, 
suggesting a 
more equitable 
distribution of 
economic gains

2007). This state of affairs has led to persistent 
social inequality and poor access to education.

Most countries have a long way to go on 
primary completion, especially for the 
poorest people

Primary school completion increased in the 
vast majority of countries between 2000 and 
2010 (Figure 2.4). Eight of the countries with 
available data increased primary attainment 
rates by over 20 percentage points: Benin, 
Cambodia, Ethiopia, Guinea, Mali, Mozambique, 
Nepal and Sierra Leone. But progress has been 
far from adequate, especially for the worst-
performing countries, signalling enduring issues 
of affordability and of the quality or relevance of 
the education.

Poverty affects primary attainment. Some 
countries, especially in Latin America, have 
made significant progress in access to schooling 
for the very poor. In Nicaragua, the primary 
attainment rate among children in the poorest 
households increased from 16% to 66% over the 
decade. The attainment rates of children from 
the poorest households also increased sizeably 
in other Latin American countries, such as the 
Plurinational State of Bolivia, Brazil, Guatemala, 
Peru and Suriname, as well as in Benin, 
Cambodia, Nepal, Sierra Leone and Viet Nam. In 
Albania and Mongolia, average primary school 
attainment rates improved by over 4 percentage 
points, and attainment rates improved 
significantly more among the very poor.

However, while primary attainment rates have 
improved in most countries, the gaps between 
the poor and the average population have also 
increased in some. This suggests policy reforms 
have benefited wealthier households more 
substantially. In Nigeria, primary attainment 
among the poorest households actually fell, 
from 35% in 2003 to 22% in 2013, with the gap 
between the average and poorest households 
increasing by about 20 percentage points.

Progression through the cycle varies 
among countries

As previous GMRs have emphasized (UNESCO, 
2012b), dropout is a serious problem in low-
income countries, especially among late 
entrants and poor children. Since Dakar, 
positive trends in survival to the last grade 
and its counterpart, reduced likelihood of 
early dropout, indicate progress by countries

GOAL 2: UNIVERSAL PRIMARY EDUCATIONMonitoring progressin providing relevant education of good quality 
throughout the primary cycle and reducing the 
cost to government of high dropout and low 
retention rates. 

Trend projections show that of the 139 countries 
with sufficient data, in 54 countries, mostly from 
Central Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, and 
Western Europe, almost all children enrolled 
in primary school would reach the last grade 
by 2015. At the other end of the spectrum, in 
32 countries, mostly from sub-Saharan Africa, 
at least 20% of children are likely to drop out 
early and to not reach the last grade. Projections 
based on cohort analysis, which combines 
intake and survival rates, show an even bleaker 
picture – only 13 out of 106 countries are likely 
to have at least 97% of children entering school 
and reaching the last grade (see Chapter 7, 
Projections, for further discussion). 

Comparison of primary adjusted net enrolment 
and survival rate to grade 5 shows that many 
countries, including Burkina Faso, El Salvador, 
Ghana, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, 
Morocco and Niger have been able to increase 
both at the same time (Figure 2.5). Burundi and 
Mali have achieved substantial growth in net 
enrolment while survival rates did not decrease 
substantially, suggesting relative success at 
absorbing students. By contrast, in Chad net 
enrolment increased by nearly 14 percentage 
points, but survival to grade 5 decreased by over 
9 percentage points.

High repetition is a sign of inefficiency in 
the education system, and poses significant 
financial and education costs. As noted in 
Chapter 1, high repetition in early primary 
grades indicates that while early childhood 
education promotes primary school readiness, 
there has been an evident lack of access to it. 
The percentage of repeaters throughout the 
primary cycle decreased by over 10 percentage 
points in at least 14 countries (Figure 2.6). In 
Mauritania and Senegal, the percentage of 
repeaters fell from more than 14% to less than 
4% between 1999 and 2012, and in Brazil, the 
percentage of repeaters declined from 24% 
to 9% in 2011.

It is difficult to evaluate the reasons for changes 
in the extent of repetition. Improved rates could 
signal increased efficiency and quality, but 

could also be due to the adoption of automatic 
promotion policies that reduce repetition without 
necessarily improving learning. In Brazil, where 
repetition has long been considered a central 
policy challenge for education, reductions 
in the percentage of repeaters are at least 
partly a result of extensive reforms to improve 
early childhood education access, increase 
remedial education and accelerated learning 
programmes, and alleviate schooling costs 
(Bruns et al., 2012; Schwartz, 2012). In Burundi, 
the fact that the percentage of repeaters 
increased substantially may signal that increases 
in enrolment were not accompanied by adequate 
efforts to respond to new entrants’ needs.

Substantial progress was made 
in user fee abolition

At the Dakar Forum in 2000, states committed 
themselves to offering ‘free and compulsory 
primary education in accordance with the United 
Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 
and other international commitments.’ The goal 
of free, compulsory, universal primary education 
actually predates the EFA movement (Bruns et 
al., 2012; Morgan et al., 2012; Somerset, 2009; 
World Bank and UNICEF, 2009), but momentum 
has increased since the movement was launched 
in 1990. Most countries now have, in principle, 
schooling free of tuition. Based on GMR team 
research, progress has been particularly 
impressive in sub-Saharan Africa, where 
15 countries have adopted legislation abolishing 
school fees since 2000. Seven have done so 
through constitutional guarantees and eight 
through other forms of legislation. An additional 
eight adopted free primary education through 
non-legislative policy measures. 

A focus on how to benefit the poor through 
finance has supported goal 2’s aspirations for 
universal primary education. Development 
partners, such as the World Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund, developed growth 
strategies in the early 2000s that benefited the 
poor, considering whether interventions had 
positive social impact on them and whether 
wealth was distributed more equally (World 
Bank, 2002, 2014b). The household burden 
caused by school fees and indirect costs were 
prominently highlighted as a form of unjust, 

In sub-Saharan 
Africa, 15

school fees

Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and 
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative, as well as the 
establishment of the Global Partnership for 
Education, may have helped increase resources 
for education and other priority areas.

Free education became politically appealing

One of the major reforms since 2000 is the 
policy where every child must go to school. This 
has assisted every person to taste the fruits of 
education. It may have robbed the farmers of their 
labour force, but it has given them the seeds for a 
better life in the future.

– Sonam, teacher in Bhutan

The significant uptake of user fee abolition 
policies was also motivated by domestic 
politics. Fee abolition is a popular election 
agenda in low income African countries. A study 
of African elections and education policies 
noted 16 instances of user fee abolition in  
sub-Saharan Africa between 1990 and 2007: 
11 countries were found to have abolished 
school fees immediately after elections, and in 
8 of those instances, a new national leader had 
been elected (Harding and Stasavage, 2014).

Abolishing school fees is a popular campaign 
position that has seeped into national political 
discourse and public consciousness. When it 
is implemented, the results are seen and felt 
by the population, and credit is likely given to 
the political leader responsible.  In Uganda’s 
1996 election, emphasis on universal primary 
education was seen as popular with the 
electorate and increased throughout the 
electoral campaign. After the elections, 
President Museveni reportedly attributed 
his victory to it (Stasavage, 2005). Leaders in 
countries emerging from conflict have viewed 
school fee abolition as a symbolic fresh start. 
Liberia, after 14 years of conflict with extremely 
poor human development indicators, abolished 
school fees in 2006 (World Bank, 2010c).

Regional political momentum has also prompted 
adoption of the policy. Mozambique suspended 
school fees to keep pace with developments in 
Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi and Uganda (World Bank 
and UNICEF, 2009). The 2009 Right to Education 
(RTE) Act of India, a key legislative advance, 
was monitored by neighbouring Pakistan as 

it prepared its own RTE Act, passed in 2012 
(Chopra, 2012; Jagmag, 2012).

The additional benefits of the policy for 
building capacity of the education system 
have contributed to its appeal. Abolishing 
school fees encouraged governments to 
decentralize financial resources and mobilize 
other stakeholders, which has indirectly built 
administrative capacity to meet the EFA goals. 
In Ghana, a capitation grant programme used 
audits to determine national needs for teachers, 
infrastructure and classrooms. This built national 
momentum for fee abolition, which received 
support from faith-based organizations and the 
private sector. In Kenya, the government decided 
to release funds directly to individual school 
accounts, and commercial banks entered into 
partnership with the government to offer services 
at a reduced rate to all 18,000 public primary 
schools (World Bank and UNICEF, 2009).

Variations were seen in rollout 
and financing

Some countries, including Ethiopia, Malawi 
and Uganda, initiated the reform all at once 
throughout the education system. Others 
phased in reforms in different districts, grades 
and levels, or through targeted exemptions for 
vulnerable populations (Morgan et al., 2012; 
World Bank and UNICEF, 2009). The sudden 
expansion of enrolment following user fee 
abolition can strain the primary education 
system. This occurred following Malawi’s 
‘big bang’ approach in 1994 (World Bank and 
UNICEF, 2009). As a result, most countries 
have used a sequenced approach. Lesotho 
government officials visited Malawi and Uganda 
to learn about their experience abolishing 
school fees, then decided to roll out free primary 

education one grade at a time starting in 2002 
(Liang et al., 2005). In Benin, school fees were 
initially abolished in the mid-1990s for girls 
in rural areas with limited education access 
before the policy was expanded nationally in 
2006 (Tomasevski, 2006). In Ghana, a pilot 
phase of a capitation grant programme targeted 
40 poor districts before civil society pressures 
prompted a quick nationwide expansion (World 
Bank and UNICEF, 2009).

Since the early 2000s, countries have used 
capitation grants, based on the number of 
students and other criteria, to finance school 
needs beyond teacher salaries. While some 
countries use enrolment data alone as the basis 
for capitation, others account for disadvantages 
faced by schools and families. Kenya’s US$14 
per student capitation grant was to be used

children with disabilities (Tomasevski, 2006). 
In the United Republic of Tanzania, 40% of 
the US$10 per student grant was supposed to 
be spent on textbooks; the government also 
provided development grants for sanitation 
and clean water supply (Bentaouet-Kattan and 
Burnett, 2004).

Fee abolition attracted students

Fee abolition had a strong positive 
impact on enrolment in the years after its 
implementation, confirming that school fees 
are a cost that deters access (UNESCO, 2003, 
2012b). Analysis of experiences in countries 
such as Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, 
the United Republic of Tanzania and Uganda 

found that fee abolition increased the likelihood 
of students enrolling in school (Alloush, 2010; 
Deininger, 2003; Morgan et al., 2012; Muyanga 
et al., 2010). Fee abolition in 2005 in Burundi 
was associated with a sharp reduction in the 
percentage of children of primary school age 
that had never been to school. By contrast, in the 
neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
there was no evidence of similar progress, since 
fees were only formally abolished in 2010 and 
there has been no study since of the policy’s 
impact (UNESCO, 2014g).

Importantly, eliminating school fees increased 
enrolment of disadvantaged groups such 
as girls and orphans in countries including 
Kenya, Malawi, Timor-Leste, Uganda, 
the United Republic of Tanzania and Zambia 
(Al-Samarrai and Zaman, 2007; Grogan, 2009; 

87

GOAL 2: UNIVERSAL PRIMARY EDUCATIONSubstantial progress was made in user fee abolitionBentaouet-Kattan, 2006; Nicola, 2010; World 
Bank and UNICEF, 2009). Uganda has been 
particularly successful: studies found that fee 
abolition for primary education reduced delayed 
entry into schooling, incentivized enrolment and 
reduced dropout, particularly for girls and for 
children in rural areas (Deininger, 2003; Grogan, 
2009; Nishimura et al., 2009).

Many countries lacked adequate and 
timely financing

Capitation grants provided through fee abolition 
initiatives to expand education systems 
were often insufficient, poorly delivered and 
inadequately targeted. The amount of capitation 
was usually lower than what schools in most 
sub-Saharan African countries had collected 
from parents, forcing them to manage more 
students with fewer resources (Bentaouet-
Kattan, 2006; Nishimura et al., 2009; 
Tomasevski, 2006). In most countries, grants 
were not indexed to inflation, and lost significant 
value in real terms over time. In Sierra Leone, 
the subsidy amount of US$2.20 per student per 
year was set in 2010 and even then deemed too 
low to cover schools’ regular operating costs. 
This and payment delays led to reinstituting 
school fees (Pôle de Dakar et al., 2013). Recent 
qualitative research from Lesotho recorded 
stakeholders arguing that the per capita 
allocation per pupil was not appropriate as it did 
not account for schools’ differing needs (Lefoka 
et al., 2014).

Delivery of grants has been at times 
inadequate. In India, monitoring of financing 
allocations and funding delivery to implement 
the RTE found that funds were not allocated 
on time because of banking delays, and 
did not always reach schools. There were 
significant regional disparities in funding 
delivery: in 2011/12, 75% of all schools received 
the mandatory grants, but only 26% did in 
Meghalaya state (Accountability Initiative, 2013). 
In South Africa, a no-fee policy targeted to the 
poorest schools was expanded to cover 60% 
of schools in 2008 and 2009. But significant 
implementation lags left many poor households 
still paying fees and the frequency of non-
attendance attributable to school fees increased 
(Nordstrum, 2012). Another substantial problem 
was well-documented corruption in capitation 
grant programmes, including in Kenya and 
Uganda (Bold et al., 2010).

Some approaches succeeded 
by increasing demand

Schooling is rarely free despite legislative 
and policy commitments to fee abolition; 
there are many other costs to families. The 
Dakar Framework stated that, ‘Wider social 
policies, interventions and incentives should 
be used to mitigate indirect opportunity costs 
of attending school.’ Initiatives to increase 
family demand for primary schooling need to 
reduce direct and indirect financial burdens 
such as transport, examination papers, school 
lunch and extra tuition (Bentaouet-Kattan and 
Burnett, 2004; UNESCO, 2012b). It has been 
shown that providing school uniforms decreases 
dropout, reduces absenteeism and encourages 
grade progression (Duflo et al., 2006; Evans 
et al., 2009).

Social protection programmes include demand-
side measures for improving education, such as 
cash transfer and school feeding programmes. 
Scholarships, stipends and bursaries are popular 
ways to reduce costs for vulnerable groups, 
especially girls, as discussed in Chapter 5. An 
analysis of 146 social protection interventions 
aimed at improving education outcomes 
conducted for this GMR found that over two-
thirds of the programmes were conditional or 
unconditional cash transfers, 17% were focused 
on school feeding and take-home rations, 
and the remainder were fee waiver or family 
allowance programmes. Over half targeted 
primary education (Bruns et al., 2012; Evans et 
al., 2009; Garcia-Jaramillo and Maranti, 2015).

School feeding programmes and  
take-home rations

Food for education initiatives are the most 
widespread social protection programmes, 
and have reached 368 million children in 
169 countries (WFP, 2013). School feeding 
programmes help ensure that children who 
attend school remain healthy. Initially expanded 
as the most effective means of reaching 
hungry children, they were galvanized by the 
consequences of severe food and financial 
crises, and the realization that the policy could 
be scaled up fairly rapidly (Bundy et al., 2009; 
Lister et al., 2011; WFP, 2013). Popular demand 
is clear. In El Salvador, school feeding is fully 
incorporated into national planning and was a

campaigns. Public officials argue that, given 
the high public demand, it would be extremely 
damaging politically to remove or reduce the 
size of school feeding programmes (Bundy 
et al., 2009).

Existing evidence, though limited, suggests that 
school feeding programme participants have 
consistently better enrolment and attendance 
than non-participants (Behrman et al., 2013; 
Lister et al., 2011). Midday meals and school 
feeding programmes in rural India have had a 
sizeable impact on girls’ enrolment (Afridi, 2011; 
Dreze and Kingdon, 2001). A meta-analytical 
review of the Food for Education programme 
in 32 sub-Saharan African countries found that 
providing on-site meals increased girls’ and 
boys’ enrolment by 28% and 22% respectively 
in the first year of the programme, and that 
effects were sustained if the programme also 
provided take-home rations (Gelli et al., 2007). 
Such rations, another incentive for children to 
stay in school, are likely to have a significant 
positive effect for very poor households. In 
Guyana, an evaluation of community-based 
school feeding programmes between 2007 
and 2009 found that enrolment increased by 
16% at participating schools and attendance 
by 4.3% (Ismail et al., 2012). A recent analysis 
of 12 rigorously evaluated studies of school 
feeding and take-home ration programmes 
from Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Chile, 
Jamaica, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, 
Peru, the Philippines and Uganda found a 
positive impact on enrolment ranging from 
6 to 26 percentage points for a number of 
countries, with larger effects for girls. The 
impact on school progression was mixed. 
Bangladesh’s take-home ration programme 
reduced dropout by 9% and Uganda’s school 
feeding programme reduced boys’ repetition 
by 20 percentage points, while Chile’s school 
feeding programme and Uganda’s take-home 
rations had no impact on any indicators of 
school progression (Behrman et al., 2013).

Cash transfer programmes

Cash transfers to vulnerable households, 
pioneered in Latin America and extensively 
analysed for their impact, have expanded in 
middle and low income Asian and African 
countries (Barrientos et al., 2010; Garcia and 

Moore, 2012), with significant coverage in middle 
income countries. Flagship programmes in 
Brazil (Bolsa Familia), Colombia (Familias en 
Acción) and Mexico (Oportunidades) now reach 
over 50% of poor households (Stampini and 
Tornarolli, 2012). The Philippines began a pilot 
programme in 2008 that was quickly expanded to 
reach 3 million households by May 2012, equal to 
over 60% of the poorest households (Chaudhury 
et al., 2013; Fernandez and Olfindo, 2011). Cash 
transfer programmes in low income countries 
have taken on distinctly different dimensions, 
especially in sub-Saharan Africa, given the 
region’s diversity, lower resources and unique 
challenges such as food insecurity and HIV 
(Garcia and Moore, 2012). In sub-Saharan Africa, 
21 countries had some form of unconditional 
cash transfer in 2010, almost doubling to 37 by 
2013 (Garcia and Moore, 2012; Gentilini et al., 
2014). However, cash transfers have not been 
scaled up in many low income countries.

Cash transfers incentivized universal primary 
education, particularly in Latin America

Most cash transfer programmes have had 
a positive impact on enrolment, attendance 
and dropout. Many have targeted children 
with specific vulnerabilities, such as extreme 
poverty, remoteness, caste and gender, or 
indigenous populations (Independent Evaluation 
Group, 2011b). Nicaragua’s short-lived Red de 
Protección Social (2000–2006) included two 
cash transfer programmes that had particularly 
major effects for primary schooling. An impact 
evaluation showed the programme was well 
targeted, with the largest impact in enrolment 
and attendance on extremely poor households 
(Maluccio and Flores, 2005). In Mexico, the 
impact of Oportunidades was calculated to 
be largest for the children with the lowest 
propensity to enrol in pre-school programmes 
(Behrman et al., 2005).

However, cash transfers do not always improve 
the education outcomes of vulnerable groups, 
possibly because of failures of implementation. 
An evaluation of Indonesia’s Program Keluarga 
Harapan found it did not draw more children into 
the education system or keep them in primary 
school, attributing the lack of impact to quarterly 
cash transfers that were likely too limited and 
delivered too late to help with parental costs 
(World Bank, 2012b).

GOAL 2: UNIVERSAL PRIMARY EDUCATIONSome approaches succeeded by increasing demandNational support was crucial for success

The cash transfer movement has been framed as 
a ‘development revolution from the Global South’ 
(Hanlon et al., 2012) because of the experiences 
of pioneering Latin American countries 
such as Brazil and Mexico. Importantly, such 
measures gave politicians a chance to push for 
programmes likely to reach the poor. Mexico’s 
Progresa, the forerunner of Oportunidades, was 
globally influential with its focus on health and 
education, its approach based on conditionality 
and its involvement of influential development 
partners (Coady and Parker, 2004; Fiszbein et 
al., 2009). The positive effects of its initial cash 
transfers from 1997 to 1999 arguably enabled 
its continuation despite a change in government 
(Levy and Rodriguez, 2005; Lustig, 2011). Such 
programmes have galvanized political support 
for left- and right-leaning governments alike. 
Voters in Brazil and Mexico have mobilized in 
greater numbers for incumbents who supported 
cash transfers, irrespective of party affiliation 
(De La O, 2012; Zucco, 2013).

Conditional cash transfer programmes 
emerged in global policy due to the influence of 
development partners such as the World Bank 
(Independent Evaluation Group, 2011c). Analyses 
of the experiences of lower income countries such 
as Kenya, Malawi and Zambia suggest that these 
programmes are still viewed as donor-led rather 
than domestic initiatives. While governments have 
accepted external funds to pilot cash transfer 
programmes, they have expressed a desire for 
sustainability, preferring to limit dependence 
on cash transfers and paying little attention to 
scaling up programmes (McCord, 2009). Also 
contributing may be the fear of increased social 
divisiveness if one income group perceives it as 
unfair that another group receives cash transfers 
(Ellis, 2012). A telling example is Nicaragua’s 
Red de Protección Social, globally acclaimed for 
its impact but discontinued because of a lack of 
broad national support (Moore, 2009). 

Conditional approaches have been 
more effective

There is debate about whether transfers should 
be made conditional on certain behaviour 
such as enrolment or attendance, or whether 
they should be provided free of conditions. 
The key rationale for conditions is to convey 
to households the value of the transfer: that 

education is important and that education 
costs. Programmes may also more easily find 
political support if they are conditioned on good 
behaviour and targeted towards improving the 
life chances of future generations (Fiszbein et 
al., 2009). On the other hand, others argue that 
poverty is the main educational constraint for 
families, and parents will spend any additional 
cash on education even without conditions 
(Hanlon et al., 2012). Conditionality can be costly 
to monitor for low income countries and may 
exclude those who need cash transfers the most 
(Garcia and Moore, 2012).

Evidence suggests that conditional cash 
transfers (CCTs), in which cash transfers 
depend on attendance, have greater an impact 
on education than unconditional cash transfers 
(UCTs). A meta-analysis of 25 studies found that 
CCTs and UCTs both improve enrolment, but 
CCTs increased the likelihood of a child being 
enrolled by 41% while UCTs increased it by 23% 
(Baird et al., 2013).

However, UCTs do not always perform worse 
and may have particular benefits. With a recent 
cash transfer pilot programme in Morocco, 
adding conditionality was found not to make 
a difference in student participation (Baird et 
al., 2013; Benhassine et al., 2013). In Zambia, 
an unconditional cash grant programme 
had modest effects on a range of education 
indicators, and seemed to have encouraged 
less educated mothers to enrol their children in 
school (Handa et al., 2014). A direct comparison 
of CCTs and UCTs in Malawi found that 
while CCTs outperformed UCTs in improving 
attendance and enrolment, UCTs were much 
more effective in preventing teen pregnancy and 
early marriage, since girls who dropped out of 
school and thus lost their CCT payments were 
more likely to marry (Baird et al., 2011).

Programmes must be more effective at 
reaching beneficiaries

Effective targeting requires identifying potential 
beneficiaries and the best methods to reach 
them. Criteria used for targeting include means 
testing, geographical location and assessments 
by community leaders; in some cases targets 
are self-selected. Some programmes are better 
targeted than others, usually where there are 
better infrastructure and capacity for programme 
administration and improvement, and better

al., 2011; Garcia-Jaramillo and Maranti, 2015). 
In general, targeted programmes often do not 
reach all of their intended populations. Key 
large-scale programmes, including Brazil’s 
Bolsa Familia, Colombia’s Familias en Acción, 
Indonesia’s Program Keluarga Harapan and 
South Africa’s Child Support Grant, have been 
shown to exclude a large proportion of eligible 
people (Garcia-Jaramillo and Maranti, 2015). 
Recent estimates suggest that only 55% of those 
with incomes below $US2.50 a day participate in 
Brazil’s Bolsa Escola programme (Stampini and 
Tornarolli, 2012). 

Demand-side approaches are popular but 
may not be cost-effective

Analysis has shown that cash transfer and 
school feeding programmes are not very cost-
effective interventions for improving education 
attainment. The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty 
Action Lab (J-PAL) cost-effectiveness analysis1 
compared programmes and found that providing 
families with deworming medication and 
information on improving earnings through 
education were the most cost-effective means 
of increasing school participation, and that 
Mexico’s Oportunidades programme was 
the least cost-effective (Abdul Latif Jameel 
Poverty Action Lab, 2014). For school feeding 
programmes, the costs of transporting, storing 
and providing food have been estimated as 
comparable, per capita, to primary school unit 
costs (Bundy et al., 2009). However, such findings 
have had limited influence on education policy, 
as the programmes have objectives beyond cost-
effectiveness and comparable data for other 
interventions are limited. For example, CCTs may 
not be as cost-effective for education access as 
deworming but have multiple benefits, affecting 
poverty, education, health and future outcomes. 
School feeding programmes are also promoted 
as providing long-term, multiple benefits. Take-
home rations provide economic benefits to poor 
households (WFP, 2013).

There is some evidence that cost-effectiveness 
may be higher where programmes provide larger 
transfers and make adequate improvements 

1. The J-PAL methodology computed cost-effectiveness in terms of number 
of increased years of education per US$100 spent (Dhaliwal et al., 2011). The 
interventions compared, drawn exclusively from J-PAL research, were parent 
information, deworming, school uniforms, merit scholarships, monitoring of 
teacher attendance, computer-assisted learning and CCTs.

on the supply side. Major improvements in 
enrolment in Nicaragua were associated with 
the largest transfer sizes – 17% of total annual 
expenditure of the household – in Latin America 
(Fiszbein et al., 2009; Maluccio and Flores, 2005). 
Such evidence suggests that maximizing cost-
effectiveness may be a more relevant metric for 
designing social assistance programmes than 
minimizing costs, which is often the default 
focus in resource-constrained contexts (Maluccio 
and Flores, 2005; Saavedra and Garcia, 2013).

More extensive analysis is needed on 
whether demand-side approaches should 
be scaled up

To what extent should cash transfer and school 
feeding programmes be used to improve 
education quality? Recent evidence on whether 
such programmes improve learning outcomes 
is mixed (Alderman and Bundy, 2012; Behrman 
et al., 2011; Bundy et al., 2009; Fiszbein et 
al., 2009; Krishnaratne et al., 2013). This is 
not entirely surprising, since most evaluated 
programmes were not initiated with the specific 
aim of improving completion and learning 
outcomes. Findings on low cost-effectiveness 
and difficulties in targeting and conditionality 
need to be supplemented with critical analysis of 
the opportunity costs of funding CCT and school 
feeding programmes compared with those 
of other essential education sector reforms 
(Reimers et al., 2006).

For cash transfer and feeding programmes to be 
scaled up, they must be simplified, including by 
limiting the number of conditions and specificity 
of targets. In cash transfer programmes in middle 
income countries, conditionality is common and 
the programmes are often monitored for non-
compliance. The Philippines’ Pantawid Pamilyang 
Pilipino Program provides cash transfers 
conditional on health and education compliance, 
utilizing a sophisticated set of geographical and 
household targeting methods (Chaudhury et al., 
2013). However, conditions have been hard to 
enforce in many countries, including Ecuador 
(Bono de Desarrollo Humano) and South Africa 
(Child Support Grant) (Garcia-Jaramillo and 
Maranti, 2015; Schady and Araujo, 2008). Given 
that even middle income countries have difficulty 
with effective targeting and conditionality, it 
would be enormously challenging for capacity-
constrained low income countries to do the same.

GOAL 2: UNIVERSAL PRIMARY EDUCATIONSome approaches succeeded by increasing demandSupply-side interventions  
have helped increase primary 
school access

Investment in infrastructure is often the largest 
educational expenditure after teacher salaries. 
Since 2000, school and classroom construction 
has become a priority because of growth in 
enrolment resulting from fee abolition and other 
demand-side incentives. Health interventions 
have also increased and can have vital effects on 
education outcomes. Some researchers argue 
that increasing supply would not substantially 
increase enrolment without complementary 
demand-side strategies and improvement in 
quality (Filmer, 2007; Glewwe and Kremer, 
2006). However, more recent evidence has found 
that infrastructure projects such as school and 
road construction have had some of the largest 
impacts on indicators on education access 
(Petrosino et al., 2012). Finally, non-government 
institutions such as private schools, community 
and non-formal schools are increasingly 
providing education alongside public schools.

School and classroom construction

Emphasis on constructing schools is predictable: 
the availability of a school building is often 
considered the first step to ensure children 
are able to attend school. In Mozambique, the 
number of primary and secondary schools 
tripled between 1992 and 2010 (Fox et al., 2012; 
UNICEF, n.d.) and the construction of new 
schools and classrooms continues (Naudeau, 
2014). Together with the effort to abolish user 
fees, school construction allowed Mozambique to 
substantially reduce the number of students who 
had never been to school, and to increase its net 
enrolment ratio by almost 35 percentage points. 
In Morocco, education access was expanded with 
the National Education and Training Charter, 
which declared 2000 to 2009 the ‘decade for 
education’ with a key focus on improving equity. 
Significant investment in school infrastructure in 
rural areas led to impressive progress in primary 
education access, including for rural girls 
(World Bank, 2005, 2013), an ongoing emphasis 
(Braham, 2014). In Afghanistan, the addition 
of village-based community schools in 2007 
increased enrolment by 42 percentage points in 
sample villages (Burde and Linden, 2012).

Infrastructure and health sector 
improvements

Many countries have made significant efforts 
to improve roads, electricity and water 
infrastructure. At the community level, these 
factors positively affect schooling access. 
Easily accessible schools and infrastructure 
improvements can be particularly important 
in increasing access for girls who have time-
intensive daily chores, as detailed in Chapter 5. 
Girls’ enrolment is particularly sensitive to 
distance to school; in Afghanistan, it fell by 
19 percentage points per mile from school 
(Burde and Linden, 2012).

Ease of access to schools has improved 
significantly, particularly in rural, underserved 
areas. Rural India saw substantial improvement 
in nearly all aspects of school facilities and 
infrastructure between 2003 and 2010. The share 
of schools with electricity more than doubled, 
from 20% to 45%. The availability of paved roads 
increased, so that 78% of schools had a road 
within 1 kilometre in 2010 compared with 69% 
in 2003 (Muralidharan et al., 2014). Improved 
electrification increases education outcomes. In 
Bangladesh, rural households with electricity 
were found to have better school enrolment 
than households without electricity (Barkat 
et al., 2002), and in India electrification had a 
long-term positive impact on girls’ and boys’ 
education (van de Walle et al., 2013). Similarly, 
an analysis of 16 African countries between 1971 
and 2010 finds a strong relationship between 
electricity consumption and education; evidence 
suggested that higher per capita electricity 
consumption caused positive primary school 
enrolment effects in Ethiopia, Kenya and South 
Africa (Ben Abdelkarim et al., 2014). Availability 
of water-related infrastructure also improves 
enrolment. A reduction in time by one hour for 
collecting water increased girls’ enrolment 
rates by about 8-9% in Yemen and 18-19% in 
Pakistan (Koolwal and van de Walle, 2010). 
Similarly, access to piped drinking water at home 
was associated with significantly higher test 
score performance in urban Brazil (Barde and 
Walkiewicz, 2014).

Large-scale malaria eradication programmes, 
funded extensively by the Global Fund to Fight 
AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, have led to 
substantial increases in numbers of years  

In Mozambique, 
the number of 
primary and 
secondary

and 2010

entry in a majority of countries. A study of  
22 sub-Saharan African countries found 
significant primary education improvements 
in 14 due to large-scale malaria interventions. 
The study argues for more targeted attention to 
areas where malaria prevalence is highest and 
education quality is lowest to ensure a higher 
education return on investment for health 
(Kuecken et al., 2013).

Private and other non-government 
institutions have become important 
education providers

The GMR uses the UNESCO Institute for 
Statistics (UIS) definition of private schooling2 
to provide statistics on the role of the private 
sector in education provision. However, the 
definition of what it means to be a private, public 
or non-government school varies around the 
world, and for-profit, non-profit, management 
or financing categories do not fully capture the 
evolving nature of most education systems. This 
lack of clarity about types of non-state schools 
is especially salient when comparing schools 
in developing and developed countries. The 
lines between community, non-formal or other 
non-government programmes are also blurry 
because of a lack of clear, consistent definitions 
(Aga Khan Foundation Team, 2008; Miller- 
Grandvaux and Yoder, 2002). Consequently, 
there is a lack of systematic data to monitor 
and evaluate the global trends of these 
various subsectors.

The private sector has grown due to 
inadequate supply, parents’ desires and  
a perception of higher quality

The role of private schooling in education has 
grown over the past two decades. In Lagos, 
Nigeria, private schools accounted for as much 
as 70% of the pre-primary and primary levels 
in the 2010/11 school year (Härmä, 2011). 
The private sector in South Asia has grown 
explosively, with approximately one-third of  
6- to 18-year-olds attending private schools 
(Dahal and Nguyen, 2014). UIS estimates show  
at least a doubling of the private share in 

2. The UIS defines private institutions as those that are not operated by 
public authorities but are controlled and managed, whether for profit or not, 
by private bodies such as non-government organizations (NGOs), religious 
bodies, special interest groups, foundations and businesses.

primary enrolment in a wide range of countries 
in the Arab States, Central and Eastern Europe 
and sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 2.7). While 
available UIS data suggest that the private share 
of primary education is below 20% for most low 
and lower middle income countries, this may 
be an underestimate due to undercounting of 
private schooling in official statistics (Dahal and 
Nguyen, 2014; Tooley and Dixon, 2005).

The reasons for and the merits of the expansion 
of the private sector’s role for the overall 
education system are a subject of much debate. 
Do private schools complement public education 
by improving supply and quality? Or in contrast, 
do they primarily perpetuate inequality by 
extracting students from wealthier and more 
motivated households who would otherwise have 
stayed in the public system (Chubb and Moe, 
1990; Hsieh and Urquiola, 2006; Nechyba, 2009)?

Private schools have likely aided school supply 
in at least two ways. First, where public sector 
supply of schools, classrooms and teachers 
has not kept pace with population growth, 
private schools may have filled a gap, providing 
education for mainstream populations. Second, 
where public schools have failed to provide 
education access to disadvantaged populations, 
such as slum children, low-fee private schools 
have entered the market.

In many contexts, parental preferences have 
increased demand for private schools. This may 
be due to perceptions of their higher quality, 
closer proximity to the household and the 
connotation of higher social status (Joshi, 2014; 
Schneider et al., 2006). Parental demand for 
private schools also reflects families’ gendered 
schooling decision-making: in India and 
Pakistan, girls are more likely to enrol in public 
schools and sons are more likely to be sent to 
private schools, perpetuating gender inequity 
(Aslam, 2009; Azam and Kingdon, 2013; Maitra 
et al., 2011).

Community, non-formal and religious schools 
may provide more relevant, flexible education 
to meet particular demands

Very different types of schools are labelled as 
‘community schools’: schools that have been 
created and primarily financed by communities, 
such as the écoles spontanées in Chad 

In India and 
Pakistan, girls 
are more likely 
to enrol in 
public schools 
and sons are  
more likely 
to be sent to 
private schools

GOAL 2: UNIVERSAL PRIMARY EDUCATIONSupply-side interventions have helped increase primary school access(Hillman and Jenkner, 2004); schools located 
in communities and funded and operated by 
local or international NGOs and multilateral 
partners; and schools where education policy 
has emphasized strengthening community 
authority, such as through school-based 
management reforms (Barrera-Osorio et al., 
2009). Community schools have often been 
found to be more relevant to local needs, 
adaptable, cost-effective and student-centric 
than government schools (DeStefano et al., 2007; 
Glassman et al., 2007). Many provide schooling 
to areas underserved by the government, such 
as in sub-Saharan African countries including 
Ghana, the United Republic of Tanzania and 
Zambia (Glassman et al., 2007).

Non-formal education centres offer diverse 
education services outside the formal system. 
Many provide flexible, accelerated learning 
programmes as bridges for students into the 
formal system or to address the needs of young 
children who have missed schooling altogether 
(Mwalimu, 2010). As several past GMRs have 
noted, non-formal education is uniquely 
important in Bangladesh (UNESCO, 2010a, 
2011b, 2012, 2014a), where the BRAC system 
operates thousands of non-formal schools 
and has been credited with increasing girls’ 
primary enrolment (Sukontamarn, 2005). The 
success of non-formal education has influenced 
government policy to create learning centres 
inspired by non-formal models to reach out-of-
school children (Dang et al., 2011).

Religious schools fill a niche for many parents. 
In Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia and 
Pakistan, Islamic schools, called madrasas, 
have long played an important role in 
providing primary and secondary education to 
underprivileged groups. Over 40,000 of these 
schools educate the poor in Indonesia; almost 
90% of the schools are run as private institutions, 
and were established by foundations (Hafidz, 
2014). The number of madrasas that follow 
government and traditional curricula and 
provide formal education to children has steadily 
increased, especially in Bangladesh (Bano, 2010). 
The Jesuit network Fe y Alegría, which operates 
schools in most of Latin America with support 
from government and international agencies, has 
helped increase enrolment, serving, by recent 
estimates, over 1 million children in 17 countries 
(Osorio and Wodon, 2014).

Reaching the marginalized 
is essential for universal 
primary education

The Dakar Framework stated that ‘the 
inclusion of children with special needs, 
from disadvantaged ethnic minorities and 
migrant populations, from remote and isolated 
communities and from urban slums, and others 
excluded from education, must be an integral 
part of strategies to achieve UPE by 2015.’

Poverty is perhaps the foremost constraint 
on education access. Comparing changes in 
primary school completion rates between 2000 
and 2010 for children from the poorest quintile 
with those for the second-poorest quintile shows 
the enduring nature of marginalization based on 
poverty (Figure 2.8): less than one-third, or 15, of 
the 52 countries with available data experienced 
improvement in reducing the gap between the 
two poorest quintiles. For example, progress 
for the poorest is much lower than for children 
from second quintile households in countries 
including Bangladesh and Cambodia.

Latin American countries (Bolivia, Brazil, 
Colombia, Nicaragua and Suriname) and 
Viet Nam saw the most substantial gains 
among children from the poorest households 
compared with those from less poor households. 
Two possible explanations are that in Latin 
America, social protection programmes and 
curricular reforms may be reaching at least 
some of the extreme poor, and that children 
from the second-poorest quintile already had 
very high completion rates in 2000. Similarly, 
the success of Viet Nam can be attributed to 
far-reaching reforms to improve education 
quality, for instance in early childhood education, 
as discussed in Chapter 1. By contrast, it is 
not surprising to find limited improvement 
among the poorest quintile in Nigeria, as 
the country has made very limited education 
progress in general.

In addition to poverty, barriers to education 
can include children’s gender, caste, ethnic 
and linguistic background, race, disability, 
geographical location and livelihood. 
Marginalized children often suffer from multiple 
disadvantages that are mutually reinforcing, 
leading to acute education deprivation in 

In Bangladesh, 
the BRAC 
system 
operates 
thousands of 
non-formal 
schools and 
has been 
credited with 
increasing 
girls’ primary 
enrolment

GOAL 2: UNIVERSAL PRIMARY EDUCATIONReaching the marginalized is essential for universal primary educationparticular populations (UNESCO, 2010a). 
Education progress is often slower for these 
groups since they lack the political voice to 
mobilize national action.

Legislative and policy progress for many 
disadvantaged groups since the inception 
of the EFA movement has led to increased 
primary school participation. Yet many key 
barriers to education for marginalized groups 
remain inadequately addressed. Sluggish rates 
of progress reflect deep-rooted practices of 
social exclusion.

Ethnic and linguistic minorities

Discrimination on the basis of ethnicity or 
language spoken at home is a long-standing 
problem in many countries of different ethno-
linguistic composition and migration experiences 
(UNESCO, 2010a). Multicountry analyses have 
found wide gaps in education participation 
and attainment between the elite or majority 
population, which often speaks the dominant 
language, and ethnic minority or disadvantaged 
indigenous groups that speak other languages 
(Smits et al., 2009). As previous GMRs have 
extensively shown, several ethnic groups, such 
as Q’eqchi’ speakers in Guatemala, Hausa 
speakers in Nigeria and Kurdish speakers 
in Turkey, are significantly more likely to be 
economically and educationally deprived 
(UNESCO, 2010a, 2014c).

Trends in education progress among such 
groups is mixed, as the contrasting cases of 
Guatemala and Nigeria show. While inequality by 
ethnicity and gender largely persisted in Nigeria 
between 2003 and 2013, in Guatemala the gaps 
between Q’eqchi’ children and non-indigenous 
children narrowed substantially between 2000 
and 2011 (Figure 2.9). In Guatemala, reforms 
included the National Languages Law in 
2003, which demanded respect for indigenous 
languages, and the establishment of a Vice-
Ministry of Bilingual Intercultural Education, also 
in 2003, which set up bilingual teacher training 
colleges and primary-level bilingual education. 
These measures had a major impact in a context 
where initial levels of initial education attainment 
were low and many indigenous people did not 
speak the dominant language (Lopez, 2010).

A growing movement to reduce the mismatch 
between languages spoken at home and at 
school credits mother tongue and bilingual 
instruction with helping preserve culture, 
empowering parents in educational contexts and 
improving education access for ethno-linguistic 
minorities (Lopez, 2010; Smits et al., 2009). 
However, as Chapter 6 shows, serious questions 
remain about the quality of education provided 
through bilingual or other schools based on 
language policy.

While Latin America has a long tradition 
of intercultural and bilingual education, 
international aid supporting such programmes 
has grown particularly since the 1990s (Ferrão 
Candau, 2010). A key role of these programmes 
is to increase the visibility of linguistic minorities 
by alleviating language barriers, which enables 
them to fight for their right to education and 
increase their overall political participation 
(Lopez, 2010).

In Europe, policies on mother tongue instruction 
vary substantially, which may indicate 
varying degrees of acceptance of immigrant 
or indigenous populations. Sweden’s 2010 
Language Act stipulates that if a municipality 
has at least five students who speak a language 
other than Swedish, then those students 
have a right to native language instruction. 
In the Netherlands, children from non-Dutch 
backgrounds may be taught in languages 
other than Dutch in grades 1 to 4 to facilitate 
their learning in all subjects. In Finland, the 
law places special emphasis on maintaining 
a student’s cultural and linguistic identity, and 
allows mother tongue instruction (in Finnish or 
Swedish) up to upper secondary levels (Bartlett, 
2015; UNESCO-IBE, 2011a, 2011b).

In Europe, the Roma people, a diverse group 
with a population of 10 to 12 million, experience 
substantial social exclusion. While primary 
school attendance is compulsory in all EU 
member states, primary attainment rates for the 
Roma are very low. A 2011 survey administered 
to over 20,000 Roma in 11 countries found that 
at least 10% of the 7- to 15-year-olds surveyed 
were not enrolled in primary grades. The out-
of-school proportion was highest in Greece, 
where more than 35% of Roma children were 
not attending school (European Union Agency for 
Fundamental Rights and UNDP, 2012).

In Guatemala, 
the gaps 
between 
Q’eqchi’ 
children and 
non-indigenous 
children 
narrowed 
substantially

96

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 21025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportPolicies to address this issue have had 
mixed success. The Roma have long been 
segregated from the rest of the population and 
over-represented in special needs schools 
and remedial education, and suffer from 
high dropout rates (Council of Europe, 2011; 
European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights 
and UNDP, 2012). In response, a multinational, 
interagency initiative, The Decade for Roma 
Inclusion, was launched in 2005 to support 
their integration. In Bulgaria, outreach, 
extracurricular activities and financial incentives 
helped increase attendance and retention 
(Themelis and Foster, 2013). However, in much 
of Europe, discriminatory practices continue 
and a lack of data on population and exclusion 
hampers efforts.

Working children

Child labour affects educational attainment 
and achievement, as Chapter 3 notes in greater 
detail. The availability of education and the 
enforcement of education legislation can reduce 
child labour, thus improving education outcomes 
and reducing poverty. Significant global progress 
in legislation to reduce child labour includes 
167 countries having ratified the 1973 Minimum 

Age Convention of the International Labour 
Organization (ILO) and 179 countries having 
ratified the 1999 ILO Worst Forms of Child 
Labour Convention. Child labour trends indicate 
the number of children aged 5 to 11 in the 
labour force fell to 73 million in 2012, a drop of 
66 million compared to 2000. Unsurprisingly, the 
incidence of child labour is still highest in poorer 
countries: in 2012, 23% of children in low income 
countries worked, compared with 6% in upper 
middle income countries (ILO, 2013b).

Analysis of household surveys confirms 
reductions in childhood employment in several 
developing countries, with Burundi, Ecuador, 
Guatemala, Malawi, Senegal, Sierra Leone, 
Togo and Viet Nam witnessing substantial 
declines in the number of children between 
7 and 11 years old in employment in the 
past decade (Figure 2.10). Sierra Leone had 
exceptional success: the percentage of children 
who were exclusively employed dropped from 
39.2% in 2000 to 7.9% in 2010. Sometimes, 
a decline in the percentage of children who 
were only employed can mean an increase 
in children who were both employed and in 
school, as occurred in Burundi (Understanding 
Children’s Work, 2015).

GOAL 2: UNIVERSAL PRIMARY EDUCATIONReaching the marginalized is essential for universal primary educationCombining work and school, while an 
improvement over not going to school at all, still 
hurts education outcomes. Average grade-for-
age data show that children who work and attend 
school lag behind their non-working peers, in 
terms of grade progression, at age 13 in almost 
all countries, likely due to repetition arising from 
poorer performance, higher incidence of late 
entry and higher absenteeism (Understanding 
Children’s Work, 2015).

Combining paid employment and household 
chores leaves children doubly disadvantaged 
and at greater risk of repeating grades 
or dropping out of school. The gendered 
dimensions of child labour are also important 
to note: girls undertake the majority of routine 
domestic chores, such as household labour and 
caregiving, which take up considerable time and 
interfere with schooling (Lyon et al., 2013).

Nomadic communities

Around the late 1990s, nomadic pastoralist 
communities were routinely omitted from 
national population counts and ignored in 
education planning (Carr-Hill, 2012; Dyer, 2015). 
Nomadic children had difficulty accessing 
schools, and formal education was often not 
highly relevant or compatible with their lifestyles 
(Krätli, 2001; Ruto et al., 2009). The result was 
low demand and poor retention for much of the 
past decade. Only recently have pastoralists 
begun to acknowledge education as a means out 
of poverty and a way to diversify livelihoods, and 
even as a complement to pastoralist knowledge. 
Today, pastoralist populations remain among the 
most underserved by education globally. Even 
in countries in eastern Africa, where nomadic 
groups make up at least 20% of the population, 
infrastructure and other investments for the

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 21025Education for All Global Monitoring Reporteducational needs of nomadic children remain 
extremely limited (Dyer, 2015).

Since 2000, the visibility of this issue has 
increased in countries with substantial 
pastoralist populations. Support for flexible 
learning frameworks, which offer students 
choices of when, where and how they learn,   
has been significant from international agencies 
and governments, particularly UNICEF and 
Save the Children, with workshops and 
Commonwealth-supported forums (Dyer, 
2015). Nomad-specific education plans have 
emerged in Ethiopia, Nigeria, Sudan and 
the United Republic of Tanzania. Kenya’s 
experience with pastoralist groups in arid 
and semi-arid lands is one of the most 
developed, albeit underfunded, initiatives for 
nomadic communities. 

But policy measures may not have increased 
enrolment of nomads. The 2003 abolition of 
school fees in Kenya largely failed to catalyse 
enrolment of nomads in arid and semi-arid 
lands. Capitation grants that take fixed schools 
as their reference point have not been useful 
for attracting mobile learners (Dyer, 2015). 
Commitment to explore or expand open and 
distance learning, potentially a useful model for 
nomadic communities, has been limited (Dyer, 
2015). Alternative basic education packages that 
were expected to serve mobile communities 
better, with flexible curricula and respect for 
community values (Carr-Hill and Peart, 2006; 
Dyer, 2015), have mostly helped populations with 
more predictable mobility patterns. In India, for 
example, seasonal labourers have been easier to 
reach than pastoralists (Dyer, 2014).

The vulnerability of nomadic groups is growing 
due to factors beyond their control. Natural 
hazards, droughts and conflicts have decreased 
the resilience of pastoralists and forcibly 
displaced nomadic groups in countries such as 
Kenya. While this threatens their lifestyle, it may 
force them to settle in rural or peri-urban areas, 
intensifying demand for their inclusion in regular 
formal schooling (Schrepfer and Caterina, 2014). 
In India, mobile pastoralism is rapidly losing 
ground to agricultural and industrial expansion 
(Dyer, 2015).

Children affected by HIV and AIDS

In 2000, the potential spread of HIV/AIDS  
was perhaps the highest visible challenge  
for education systems and livelihoods in  
sub-Saharan Africa (see Introduction and 
Chapter 3 for further discussion). The number 
of children orphaned and vulnerable because of 
AIDS is expected to dip slightly to about 15 million 
by 2020, with the overwhelming majority 
remaining in  sub-Saharan Africa (UNICEF, 2013h). 
Children who have lost one or both parents are 
especially likely to drop out of school (Case et al., 
2004). While recent quantitative analysis suggests 
the ratio of orphans’ school attendance is at 
near parity with that of non-orphans (Smiley et 
al., 2012; UNICEF, 2013h), qualitative research 
reports that orphans face particular barriers to 
education, including caregiving responsibilities 
for sick relatives, stigma and frequent migration 
(Goldberg and Short, 2012; van Blerk and Ansell, 
2006). In Durban, South Africa, teachers and 
other school support helped vulnerable children 
stay in school (Unterhalter et al., 2008). Studies 
of children’s emotional experiences of HIV 
caregiving report emotional distress and worry 
that can affect their schooling (Casale et al., 2014; 
Cluver et al., 2011).

Since Dakar, the growth in financing, policies 
and support services related to children affected 
by HIV and AIDS has focused primarily on their 
care, treatment and social welfare, and has not 
prioritized education (Fleming, 2015; Global Fund, 
2014). The first policies to address education 
access for orphaned and vulnerable children 
emerged around the mid-2000s. Numerous 
countries in sub-Saharan Africa and in South 
and West Asia have since created national action 
plans for such children (Fleming, 2015).

Broad and specific strategies have been used to 
improve education for orphaned and vulnerable 
children. To support retention, Tamil Nadu 
state in India used welfare programmes to 
reduce the disparity between orphaned and 
vulnerable children and non-orphans, such as 
providing textbooks, uniforms, bus passes and 
financial assistance to children who have lost a 
breadwinning parent. In Zambia, a multisector 
strategy has been frequently updated over the

GOAL 2: UNIVERSAL PRIMARY EDUCATIONReaching the marginalized is essential for universal primary educationlast 15 years to reflect the changing needs, 
environment and demographics of HIV- and 
AIDS-affected and vulnerable children. 
Community schools also support education 
access for orphans and vulnerable children 
(Fleming, 2015).

Urban slum children

At the time of Dakar in 2000, most national 
governments were ambivalent about providing 
education and other services in informal urban 
settlements and slum areas. Since then, the 
issue of slum dwellers has become more 
critical, with poverty urbanizing at a rapid rate 
due to substantial migration from rural areas. By 
2012, 863 million people in developing countries, 
or about one-third of the urban population, were 
living in slums (Kielland, 2015).

In the absence of adequate government policy 
and planning, NGOs and the private sector have 
played a significant role in providing education 
to slum dwellers. Low-fee private schools have 
proliferated in urban slums in India, Kenya 
and Nigeria (Srivastava, 2006; Tooley and 
Dixon, 2003; Walford, 2013), as well as in other 
countries (Box 2.1).

The establishment of NGO and civil society 
networks in poor urban settlements has raised 
awareness and increased lobbying efforts 
around the difficulties of slum dwellers in 
access to education. Shack/Slum Dwellers 
International, a network of community-based 
organizations in 33 countries in Latin America 
and the Caribbean, South and West Asia and 
sub-Saharan Africa, has helped count slum 
populations and map local development needs 
(Shack/Slum Dwellers International, 2014). 
Recently, some governments have increased 
attention to the education of children in slums. 
For example, Bangladesh has highlighted 
the need to add slums to its long-standing 
focus on rural children, and to discuss the 
special challenges of Dhaka’s slums (Vawda 
and Sarr, 2013).

Problems in educating slum children include 
authorities’ belief that improving conditions 
within such settlements may further accelerate 
migration into the cities. In Haiti, after a 
temporary drive to keep urban earthquake-
affected and displaced children in school, rural 

areas appeared to recapture the focus of the 
government and its partners (Kielland, 2015). 
Another challenge is that many settlements are 
illegal, and as such not typically recognized in 
government plans for education provision. Slum 
children may lack documentation such as birth 
certificates or residential papers necessary 
for local school admission. Moreover, extreme 
violence and substance abuse may add to the 
challenges they face (Kielland, 2015).

Children with disabilities

Marginalization is higher for children with 
disabilities, and disability is common. The 
OECD states that almost one-fifth of students 
may develop a special educational need 
during their schooling years (OECD, 1999). The 
disadvantages of disability are often magnified 
by social status, gender and health conditions. 
While data are limited, the most recent global 
estimate of disability prevalence is that between 

Box 2.1: Private schooling in slums

Private schools in urban slums typically have low fees, 
are not aided by the government and may be invisible 
in official records. They are usually underfinanced, have 
difficulty collecting funds from parents and lack resources 
to meet expensive regulations.

Large-scale data collection in slum areas found that only 
35% of children from low income families in Hyderabad, 
India, and 25% of slum children in Lagos, Nigeria, 
attended government schools. In Kenya, more recent 
data suggested that over 40% of the poorest students 
in slums attended private schools, and that this number 
increased steadily after user fee abolition in 2003. 
Similarly, a study of a Lagos slum found only 3 public 
primary schools, all in the same building on the periphery 
of the area, but 35 private schools, of which only 4 were 
government approved.

In many of the vast slums in Kenya and Nigeria, the 
nearest public schools are on the areas’ fringes. This 
indicates that a lack of stable, government-provided 
schools forces parents to choose private schools. 
Consistent with the broader debate on non-government 
provision, other experts have argued that low-cost private 
schools are desired because they are conveniently 
located, have smaller class sizes, hire teachers who 
are more aware of the needs of slum dwellers and may 
produce better academic outcomes.

disability (World Health Organization (WHO) and 
World Bank, 2011).

Disability status increases the risk of educational 
exclusion. In developing countries, disability 
status has been found to be highly correlated 
with poverty (Banks and Polack, 2014; Mitra 
et al., 2013), and even more predictive of non-
enrolment than socio-economic status, rural 
location or gender (Filmer, 2008). Girls with 
disabilities can be especially marginalized. 
Recent research from western Africa found that 
girls with disabilities faced increased isolation, 
stigmatization and discrimination; experienced 
a lack of schooling and other opportunities 
to participate in communal life; and were at 
particular risk of abuse, including forms of sexual 
violence (Coe, 2013). Children with disabilities 
who attend school are more likely to be excluded 
in the classroom and to drop out. Aggregated 
analysis from 51 countries found a 10 percentage 
point gap in primary completion rates between 
people with and without disability, a likely 
underestimate given the undercounting of people 
with disabilities (WHO and World Bank, 2011). 

A recent analysis conducted across 30 countries 
hosting Plan International sponsorship 
programmes confirms earlier findings. The study 
found that children with disabilities were far less 
likely to attend school, had less accumulated 
schooling and were more likely to report a serious 
illness in the last year. Children with hearing 
or visual impairments had better schooling 
outcomes compared with children with learning or 
communication impairments (Kuper et al., 2014).

Various barriers by governments, schools, 
communities and families limit disabled 
children’s access to schooling (Banks and 
Polack, 2014; Global Campaign for Education, 
2014c; WHO and World Bank, 2011). These 
include a lack of understanding about forms 
of disability and disabled children’s needs; 
insufficient resources to accommodate 
diverse needs, including a lack of teacher 
training and physical facilities; discriminatory 
attitudes towards disability and difference; and 
poor data on which to build policy (WHO and 
World Bank, 2011).

Significant success has been achieved in 
raising visibility since Dakar

International declarations, such as the 
Salamanca Statement (UNESCO, 1994) and 
the United Nations Convention on the Rights 
of Persons with Disabilities, have facilitated 
policy and advocacy for educating children with 
disabilities. Global agencies and NGOs have 
developed inclusive education models (Box 2.2) 
and incorporated them into their education 
programming (Booth and Ainscow, 2002, 1998), 
with the broader goal of promoting inclusive 
societies. Several high-profile declarations in the 
past decade signalled growing regional interest 
in providing access to education for children with 
disabilities (Sarr and Dube, 2010; Schriner, 2003; 

Disability

Box 2.2: Challenges in defining  
‘inclusive education’ 

There is no universal agreement on what constitutes 
inclusive education. Broadly, its provision requires 
governments to take responsibility for and educate 
all children regardless of their needs. More ambitious 
approaches to inclusion are commonly grounded in a 
rights-based approach that aims to empower learners, 
celebrate diversity and combat discrimination. It suggests 
that, with adequate support, all children, irrespective of 
their different needs, should be able to learn together in 
mainstream classrooms in their local communities.

Historically, disability has been understood using a 
medical model, which defines disabilities in terms of 
categorization of impairment, such as being blind, deaf 
or mute, or physically or mentally handicapped. This 
model has often led to social segregation of children with 
disabilities in education systems, stigmatizing them as 
abnormal, and physical segregation through placement 
in separate special needs schools away from mainstream 
education, which provides access to education but can 
further perpetuate negative attitudes and discrimination, 
and thus cannot be considered ‘inclusion’.

The past decade of education policy-making has been 
marked by growing awareness and understanding of 
disability from a social perspective, ‘as arising from the 
interaction of a person’s functional status with the physical, 
cultural, and policy environments’. The social model of 
disability as related to education implies including children 
with disabilities in mainstream education rather than 
segregating them in separate institutions. However, this is 
still difficult to achieve in practice, and segregation tends 
to be the dominant practice in many countries.

World Bank (2011).

GOAL 2: UNIVERSAL PRIMARY EDUCATIONReaching the marginalized is essential for universal primary educationUN Economic and Social Commission for Asia 
and the Pacific, 2012). The UK Department for 
International Development (DFID), a prominent 
funder in international education, has now 
committed to prioritizing disability-related 
programming and research, and the Global 
Partnership for Education has pledged to make 
disability a priority financing area in education 
planning (Global Campaign for Education, 2014c).

An ongoing and much-needed major initiative 
is the improvement of data collection on 
disability. Only 21 countries have living standard 
surveys that collect data on chronic illness and 
disability (World Bank, 2014d). The UNICEF Ten 
Questions screen, a large set of comparable data 
on disability issues for low income countries, 
set up in 2005, provides only an indication of 
disability risk and may overestimate the number 
of children actually living with disabilities 
(UNESCO, 2014c). Collection of comparable 
data is further complicated by variation in 
cultural interpretations of disability and what 
is considered ‘normal’ functioning. As a result, 
initiatives are under way to improve data 
collection definitions, modules and processes 
(UNICEF, 2014c), and to develop national-level 
disaggregated data systems on disability (Global 
Campaign for Education, 2014c).

Varied strategies are used to improve inclusion

The majority of countries have begun 
transitioning to the social model of disability and 
inclusive education, although some still favour 
segregation. In Europe, while Cyprus, Lithuania, 
Malta, Norway and Portugal strongly encourage 
inclusive education, Germany and Belgium 
still rely on special education infrastructure 
(WHO and World Bank, 2011). In practice, most 
countries have hybrid policies and are improving 
their inclusionary practices incrementally.

Some countries provide excellent models. 
Finland has a holistic approach to improve 
inclusion. Through its education reforms, the 
number of elementary students in special 
education decreased from an already low 2.0% 
in 2000 to 1.3% in 2009 (Official Statistics of 
Finland, 2009). Its ambitious multisector policy 
programme, VAMPO (2010–2015), aims for major 
structural changes and initiatives that improve 
the overall context for addressing disabilities. 
In education, comprehensive reform takes 
a lifelong learning perspective with goals to 

improve the equity and accessibility of study 
materials, improve transition rates between 
primary and secondary education, and further 
support vocational and higher education (Finland 
Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, 2012).

Viet Nam has shown prolonged, profound 
commitment to inclusive education by gradually 
developing adequately resourced, large-scale 
programmes, including strategies for curriculum 
reform and teacher training. Rural and urban 
pilot projects in the early 1990s offered relatively 
cost-effective teacher training and technical 
assistance for inclusion. While disability 
status is still linked significantly to poverty 
and reduced education outcomes in Viet Nam 
(Mont and Cuong, 2011), the success of the 
pilot programmes helped policy-makers see 
new possibilities for disability-related inclusion, 
and encouraged the adoption of new laws and 
policies (WHO and World Bank, 2011). However, 
a persistent challenge to policy implementation 
has been lack of clarity over the interpretation of 
and strategies for inclusive education (Box 2.3).

In India, the RTE and the main EFA programme, 
Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, created opportunities 
for people with disabilities to be included in 
mainstream schools. National estimates of 

Box 2.3: Interpreting ‘inclusive education’  
in Viet Nam 

The Viet Nam government has not made a clear choice 
between the social and medical models of education 
provision for children with disabilities. On one hand, 
the government has developed a comprehensive set 
of policies and guidelines on inclusive education. 
International NGOs working in Viet Nam have successfully 
implemented inclusive education projects, including 
teacher training, awareness-raising and community 
participation using a rights-based approach. On the other 
hand, policies and programmes are rooted in the medical 
model. As a result, inclusive education, special education 
and semi-integrated education coexist and policies 
are contradictory. The Government of Vietnam 2010 
Disability Law states that inclusive education should be 
the main mode of education for children with disabilities, 
and a multiministry decree on supporting inclusive 
education calls for the transition of specialized schools 
into Inclusive Education Resource Centres. However, the 
government’s Education Strategy 2011–2020 commits 
to more investment in specialized education for children 
with disabilities.

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 21025Education for All Global Monitoring Reportenrolment of children with special needs show a 
sharp increase, from 566,921 in 2002/03 to 2.16 
million in 2007/08, and the percentage of schools 
with ramps increased from 1.5% in 2004 to 55% 
in 2012/13. However, a large share of children 
with disabilities still remains out of school. In 
2012/13, it was estimated that, nationally, almost 
half the children with mental disabilities were 
out of school. Still, the advances represent major 
progress and reflect emerging political attention 
to children with disabilities (Singal, 2015).

Several inclusive policies have been piloted 
in sub-Saharan African countries with 
international support, especially from DFID. 
In Rwanda, two projects funded through the 
Innovation for Education Fund are trying to 
develop standards and norms for inclusive 
education, and increase ownership at the local 
and community level to increase education 
access. Some education projects in Ethiopia, 
Malawi and the United Republic of Tanzania 
provide needs-based support, build schools 
adapted for disabled children, support teacher 
training, develop textbooks in Braille and carry 
out awareness campaigns on inclusion (Global 
Campaign for Education, 2014c).

Community involvement can help alleviate 
societal barriers

A major challenge in improving education 
for children with disabilities is that cultural 
discrimination can exacerbate undercounting 
of disabled children, their lack of access to 
education and other opportunities to lead a 
fulfilling life (Grimes et al., 2015; Singal, 2015). 
Along with efforts to improve national-level 
data collection, approaches that involve the 
community, parents and the children themselves 
need to be encouraged, as they are more likely 
to provide sustainable, locally relevant solutions 
and foster a social model of inclusion. The 
Oriang Project in Kenya aimed to change the way 
of thinking of teachers, parents and the wider 
community by training them about the principle 
of inclusion. Participative approaches to data 
collection, such as listening to personal stories 
of children with disabilities using audiovisual 
methods, as was done in a refugee programme 
in Jhapa, Nepal, have also been shown to help 
integrate children into schooling (WHO and 
World Bank, 2011). 

Education in complex 
emergencies is an 
evolving problem

As defined by WHO, complex emergencies are 
situations of disrupted livelihoods and threats 
to life produced by warfare, civil disturbance 
and large-scale movements of people, in which 
any emergency response has to be conducted 
in a difficult political and security environment 
(Wisner and Adams, 2002). Education in complex 
emergencies is an evolving problem, and a 
serious one. 

The number of refugees and internally displaced 
persons (IDPs) grew to 51.2 million in 2013, 
the highest number since the Second World 
War. Half of these forcibly displaced people are 
children (Internal Displacement Monitoring 
Centre, 2014b; UNHCR, 2013). More than 
172 million people globally were estimated 
to be affected by conflict in 2012 (Centre for 
Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters, 
2013). Conflict-affected countries account for 
one-third of people living in extreme poverty 
and over half of global child mortality (Nicolai, 
2015). Emergency situations exacerbate 
marginalization, as poverty, social exclusion, 
conflict, natural disasters and climate change 
interact to compound vulnerability (Climate 
Change and African Political Stability, 2013; 
Harris et al., 2013; UN Secretary-General, 2013).

A major challenge in addressing or analysing 
education in emergency situations is a lack 
of evidence on the educational and economic 
costs of disruption of school-age populations 
at the country level (Nicolai et al., 2014). Yet it 
is clear that education systems are disrupted. 
The proportion of out-of-school children living 
in conflict-affected countries increased from 
30% in 1999 to 36% in 2012, and increased 
substantially in the Arab States and in South 
and West Asia (see Introduction). Research on 
natural disasters is more limited, but recent 
estimates suggest that 175 million children 
are likely to be affected by natural disasters 
annually (UN Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, 
2012). Improved data are leading to growing 
visibility and recognition of education concerns 
for internally displaced populations. In Nigeria, 
data on displacement were produced for the

GOAL 2: UNIVERSAL PRIMARY EDUCATIONEducation in complex emergencies is an evolving problemfirst time in 2013 and, at 3.3 million people, far 
exceeded earlier estimates of the scale of the 
problem (Internal Displacement Monitoring 
Centre, 2014b).

Emergency situations weaken the social 
compact and lead to a high number of incidents 
of school attacks, rape and sexual violence, 
further marginalizing already disadvantaged 
groups (Global Coalition to Protect Education 
from Attack, 2014). Boys and girls are both at 
risk of being forcibly recruited, sometimes from 
their classrooms, and exploited as front-line 
soldiers or used as spies, suicide bombers 
and sexual slaves (Coalition to Stop the Use 
of Child Soldiers, 2008). Girls have additional 
vulnerabilities in conflict situations: more than 
200 Nigerian schoolgirls were kidnapped in April 
2014 just because they were in school (Abubakar, 
2014), and at the height of the Afghanistan war, 
girls’ schools were disproportionately targeted 
for violent attacks (Global Coalition to Protect 
Education from Attack, 2014). The current 
situation in the Syrian Arab Republic is the 
largest displacement crisis in the world (Box 2.4).
Natural disasters also result in deterioration of 
infrastructure and resources, which can lead 
to permanent loss of human capital, increased 
prevalence of child labour and setbacks in health 
and employment opportunities (Baez et al., 2010). 

Policy has changed since Dakar

I left because of the things that were happening, 
with the rebels. They destroyed our school, we 
couldn’t go any more. They didn’t like the way some 
of the girls were dressed. They yelled at us, saying 
that what we were wearing wasn’t good. They broke 
our school desks, destroyed our school books and 
our things. School is supposed to be a place where 
we learn things.

– Sita, student in Nigeria 

Box 2.4: Education in a situation of dramatic 
displacement: Syrian Arab Republic

What are the long-term ramifications of the Syrian crisis? 
Some believe the crisis will lead to a ‘lost generation’, 
with the majority of Syrian children lacking fundamental 
necessities and unable to gain an education. In 2013 
alone, over 9,500 people a day fled their homes as the 
Syrian Arab Republic entered its third year of conflict. As 
of December 2013, of the 4.8 million school-age Syrian 
children, some 2.2 million inside the country were out of 
school, as were a half-million refugee children in Egypt, 
Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. The Syrian Network for 
Human Rights alleges that the government has turned a 
thousand schools into detention and torture centres, and 
numerous schools have been converted into barracks. 
Two-thirds of the refugee children are out of school, 
and this group now faces lower enrolment ratios than 
those found in Afghanistan, a country with a much longer 
history of conflict and a poorer tradition of education. The 
sheer numbers of refugee children are overwhelming 
education systems in neighbouring countries.        

The multinational nature of the Syrian crisis is recognized, 
with separate coordination groups working in each country. 
In the Syrian Arab Republic, a working group on education 
focusing on a coordinating role is hosted by Save the 
Children. A Syria Regional Response Plan examines 
education activities in Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and 
Turkey. A high-level regional conference on education and 
the Syrian refugee crisis has been held. Activities include 
providing school kits, rehabilitating schools and learning 
spaces, and running summer learning programmes. Child-
friendly spaces have been set up in at least 16 camps.

However, meeting the education needs of this diverse 
population will remain a key challenge, given country 
capacities and ongoing tensions. Despite major pledges 
by most wealthy nations, humanitarian aid has trickled in 
slowly over the past four years. The need for education 
financing remains underserved.

Watkins (2013).

In the 1990s, global humanitarian assistance 
more than doubled (Randal and German, 2002), 
reflecting growing awareness of civil wars, ethnic 
confrontations and regional conflicts such as 
the Balkan wars and the Rwandan genocide 
(Stockholm International Peace Research 
Institute, 2000). Despite increased attention to 
humanitarian crises, there was limited emphasis 
on education (Boothby, 1992; Nicolai, 2015). 
UNHCR created its first set of educational field 
guidelines in the 1990s (Nicolai, 2015); UNESCO’s 

Teacher Emergency Package was first used in 
Mogadishu in 1993; UNICEF began using kits to 
provide educational and recreational materials in 
emergencies in 1991, and initiated ‘child-friendly 
spaces’ from around 1999 (Sinclair, 2001). 
International NGOs, such as CARE, Catholic 
Relief Services, Christian Children’s Fund (now 
ChildFund International), the International 
Rescue Committee and Save the Children, 
began playing an important role in the education 
response (Nicolai and Tripplehorn, 2003).

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 21025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportThe field of education in emergencies struggled 
in the late 1990s with conceptual hurdles 
including how to define the duration of an 
emergency, whether non-formal schooling was 
acceptable education and whether education in 
emergencies was its own humanitarian sector, 
as it fell between emergency humanitarian 
responses that did not prioritize education and 
development work on education where actors 
rarely worked in crisis situations. Unsurprisingly, 
key humanitarian agencies had limited capacity 
to provide education in emergency situations 
(Nicolai, 2015).

Since 2000, education in situations of crisis 
and emergency has been consolidated as a 
new field, recognized as one of the six areas 
of concern at Dakar, and developed since then 
(World Education Forum, 2000). The UN and 
international NGOs that attended Dakar formed 
the Inter-Agency Network on Education in 
Emergencies (INEE), which has grown into a vast 
network of organizations and individuals working 
in over 170 countries.

Establishing minimum standards for education 
in emergencies was a key advance, developed 
through a year-long process in 2003 with 
contributions from over 2,250 individuals and 
more than 50 countries (Anderson, 2004; 
Nicolai, 2015). The standards have since been 
used extensively in both conflict and natural 
disaster settings, most frequently for preparing 
for emergencies, but also for advocacy and 
coordination (INEE, 2012). Global reports such as 
the Education Under Attack series and the 2011 
EFA Global Monitoring Report brought widespread 
attention to the field and the scale of the 
challenges facing it. A further development is 
growing financial commitment for fragile states 
by the Global Partnership for Education (Nicolai, 
2015), as this GMR’s finance chapter shows.

A new cluster approach has helped 
mainstream the response

One of the most significant developments 
for education in emergency has been the 
cluster approach of the Inter-Agency Standing 
Committee (IASC). It ensures a holistic response 
where the education cluster is one of 11 main 
sectors of humanitarian action such as health, 
water sanitation and logistics. The approach 
entails designating a lead agency and assigning 

groups of humanitarian organizations to 
each sector. 

At the global level, the Education Cluster Unit 
and the Education Cluster Working Group 
focus on strengthening capacity to prepare for, 
respond to and recover from emergencies. At 
the country level, Education Clusters have been 
activated in over 40 countries. An education 
cluster is activated in a country for a given 
humanitarian crisis’s full duration, either 
short term or, where crises are protracted, for 
years. At the time of writing, 20 country-level 
education clusters were active. The cluster 
approach, as adapted to education, has been 
used extensively for policy planning, advocacy, 
programming and capacity-building, led by 
UNICEF in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 
and by Save the Children in Haiti (Lattimer, 2012; 
Nicolai, 2015).

In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, conflict 
since 1996 has left more than 5 million people 
dead (Nicolai, 2015) and displaced as many as 
3 million (Internal Displacement Monitoring 
Centre, 2014b). In 2006, the country became 
one of the pilot countries for the IASC Education 
Cluster approach. Cluster activities included 
setting up emergency classrooms, distributing 
education kits, providing teacher training 
and accelerated learning programmes, and 
developing risk reduction plans. As a result of 
one-year bridging courses, over 126,000 children 
were able to reintegrate into school in 2013 
(Nicolai, 2015).

In Haiti, a massive earthquake in 2010 left 
over 220,000 dead and 2.3 million homeless. 
It was followed the same year by a cholera 
epidemic and Hurricane Tomas. About 80% of 
the schools in Haiti were damaged or destroyed 
as a result of the earthquake (Nicolai, 2015). In 
the months following, the cluster coordinated 
the work of more than 100 organizations. In the 
first year of response, nearly 200,000 children 
benefited from temporary learning spaces and 
over 500,000 children received basic learning 
materials (Lattimer and Berther, 2010).

Challenges remain

Despite major advances, persistent challenges 
remain in addressing education in emergencies. 
In long-term conflict situations, such as in 

Establishing 
minimum 
standards for 
education in 
emergencies 
was a key 
advance

105

GOAL 2: UNIVERSAL PRIMARY EDUCATIONEducation in complex emergencies is an evolving problemthe Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria 
and Pakistan, the length and intensity of the 
situation have had severe impacts beyond 
conflict-affected regions, through broader 
collateral damage, as well as indirect impacts 
such as forced displacements, reduced foreign 
investment and increased health problems 
(Jones and Naylor, 2014).

Furthermore, it is unclear when ‘displacement’ 
and ‘emergencies’ end. Even after displaced 
populations return, there are problems. In 
Pakistan, registered IDPs began returning 
to federally administered tribal areas at the 
end of military operations in 2009, but the 
more than 1.4 million who have returned are 
still struggling to recover their livelihoods, 
and sorely lack access to schooling (Internal 
Displacement Monitoring Centre, 2014b).
The transience of displaced people also 
complicates the delivery of education. In 
22 countries monitored in 2013, more than 
60% of IDPs were living outside camps. In 
some countries, the children of such IDPs 
may be less likely to attend school than 
those living in camps where free education is 
provided (Internal Displacement Monitoring 
Centre, 2014b).

Arguably the most important point is that, 
with education considered a less immediate 
concern in an emergency, the lack of funding 
for education within humanitarian aid budgeting 
remains a huge problem (see Finance chapter).

Conclusions

National and international commitments to 
primary education have led to considerable 
progress in many low income countries since 
2000. Gains achieved through both demand- 
and supply-side initiatives are impressive, 
especially considering the challenges faced by 
many countries in this period, from economic 
crises and natural disasters to conflict and 
population growth.

Progress towards universal primary education 
appears related to legitimacy and power: 
whether initiatives have political and community 
support and whether marginalized groups are 
considered worthy of access to education. The 
proliferation of non-government education 
providers, a development mostly unanticipated at 
the time of the World Education Forum in Dakar, 
is indicative of this situation, showing a lack of 
adequate government attention to marginalized 
groups, and the fact that these providers are 
better able to meet different types of parental 
desires, including quality and stratification.

Government and civil society must work together 
in a concerted way to promote universal primary 
education for the larger population, and to 
increase community ownership as well as 
understanding of the major benefits for everyone 
in society of improved education and development 
outcomes for marginalized groups. Multilateral 
institutions and civil society advocates that work 
on these issues globally, regionally and locally 
cannot compensate for a lack of involvement by 
national governments. Policies recommended at 
the global level to improve access to education 
are unlikely to ‘trickle down’ to the national 
level, overcome structural barriers and address 
specific contextual needs.

Finally, the commitment to education access 
must be equalled by a focus on learning and 
relevance, as discussed in more detail in 
Chapter 6 on quality. This will allow progression 
through the primary school cycle and 
advancement to further education. Focusing on 
quality will also ensure that public education 
can become a vehicle for social mobility for 
disadvantaged populations.

CHAPTER X Goal X: Early childhood care and educationHighlights ■Despite a drop in child mortality rates of nearly 50%, 6.3 million children under the age of 5 died from causes that are mostly preventable in 2013. ■Progress in improving child nutrition has been considerable. Yet globally, 1 in 4 children are still short for their age – a sign of chronic deficiency in essential nutrients. ■In 2012, 184 million children were enrolled in pre-primary education worldwide, an increase of nearly two-thirds since 1999. ■Governments have committed to expand pre-primary education but private providers still account for one-third of all enrolled children worldwide. ■By 2014, 40 countries had implemented compulsory pre-primary education. In several Latin American countries, this led to a steady improvement in the enrolment of pre-primary aged children. ■The quality of childcare for very young children remains a serious issue. The knowledge, skills, status and pay for early childhood teachers must be addressed.Highlights ■As a result of increasing transition rates and higher retention rates, participation in lower and upper secondary education has increased since 1999. In Afghanistan, China, Ecuador, Mali and Morocco, the lower secondary gross enrolment ratio has increased by at least 27 percentage points. ■Inequality persists in the transition from primary to secondary school. In the Philippines, just 69% of primary school graduates from the poorest families continued into lower secondary, compared with 94% of adolescents from the richest households. ■Two out of three countries where lower secondary education was not compulsory in 2000 had changed their legislation by 2012, including India, Indonesia, Nigeria and Pakistan. ■Over 1.7 million displaced children and young people are denied access to education. More must be done to address education access and achievement for migrant students, including policies on language, legal status and finance.  ■Adult education programmes in high income countries appear to have mostly served those who completed secondary education rather than adults who lack basic skills. ■Contemporary society requires citizens with skills for civic engagement, living a healthy life and sustainable development. New measurements and broader definitions for “skills” will become increasingly important after 2015. 1025Youth and adult skills ...................111

Many young people lack the skills they 
need for decent jobs. Global efforts 
are required to build the foundational 
skills for entering the workforce and 
actively participating in society. This 
chapter describes progress in access 
to secondary education, as well as 
barriers for marginalized groups. 
It examines skills and values that 
matter for social progress, and calls 
for education alternatives for those no 
longer in school. Finally, the chapter 
reviews the changing discourse on 
technical and vocational skills, and 
examples of adult education. 

In Vietnam, in addition to the formal curriculum, 
students participate in extracurricular activities and 
attend seminars on the environment, health and peace. 
Educating and providing children and adults with the 
skills they need to thrive in society is an important part 
of implementing the education development goals in the 
21st century.“

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALL1025Education for All Global Monitoring Report  Goal 3    Youth and adult skills

Ensuring that the learning needs of all young people and adults are met through 
equitable access to appropriate learning and life-skills programmes.

The third Education for All (EFA) goal focused 
on youth and adults, and was to be reached not 
merely through formal education in schools 
but also through experiences outside the 
school, such as on-the-job training or other 
opportunities over the life course. The wide 
focus of goal 3 came at the cost of clarity: it 
lacks a clear measurable target and refers 
to an outcome – life skills – that can be 
understood in a diversity of ways.1 Despite such 
ambiguities, this chapter addresses the following 
questions: What type of access to what types 
of skills increased since Dakar? What changes 
in opportunity are evident for marginalized 
groups? What advances have been made in 
the monitoring of life skills, policies affecting 
access to skills programmes, and the discourse 
around skills? This chapter considers three 
types of skills – foundational, transferable and 
vocational – and beyond skills for livelihoods, 
this chapter also discusses skills that matter for 
other outcomes. 

The most important indicator of progress 
in opportunities to acquire foundation skills 
is access to secondary school. The chapter 
describes policies supporting secondary school 
access as well as socio-economic inequality. 
Particular attention is given to two disadvantaged 
marginalized groups, working adolescents and 
migrant youth.

To examine attainment of transferable skills, 
this chapter reviews progress in knowledge on 
health and changes in values. An assessment 
of changes in the provision of technical and 
vocational education and training (TVET) and 
adult education is not possible due to the lack 
of systemic information at the global level. 
Developments in these areas are therefore 
described mainly using case studies.

Finally, the chapter points to new directions 
for a post-2015 framework based on direct 
measurement of transferable skills. Studies 

1. These have been discussed extensively in the previous 2002, 2006, 2007 and 
2012 EFA Global Monitoring Reports.

like the OECD’s 2012 Programme for the 
International Assessment of Adult Competencies 
(PIAAC) and the World Bank’s Skills Toward 
Employment and Productivity (STEP) framework 
gauge the importance of cognitive and non-
cognitive skills that matter to adults’ livelihoods, 
well-being and citizenship. Although direct skill 
assessments cannot yet be compared over time, 
programmes like STEP and PIAAC could make 
it possible to monitor equitable skill attainment 
in many countries in the future. Direct measures 
could begin to supplement indicators of the 
provision of skills and lifelong learning. 

Defining skills 

What are ‘skills’? Many languages distinguish 
between capabilities that are innate and 
competencies that are acquired through 
experience in schools and non-school settings. 
English uses the words ‘intelligence’ and 
‘talent’ to refer to capabilities that are inborn 
or acquired early in childhood. The Dakar 
Framework for Action used the English word 
‘skills’ to refer to competencies that can be 
gained from experiences during and after 
childhood, especially through education. 

Skills are understood by the EFA movement 
to originate from deliberate and intentional 
experiences offered by formal, non-formal, 
employer-based or other lifelong learning 
opportunities. As used in this chapter, ‘skills’ is 
more specific than general ‘knowledge’ because 
skills are intended to yield economic, social, 
developmental or political consequences. 

The Dakar Framework referred to ‘life skills’, 
advocating not only the capability of generating 
or adding value to an economic product (what 
economists term ‘human capital’), but also 
the skills individuals need for a fulfilling 
and healthy life and full participation in 
society. Understandings of life skills evolved 
after Dakar. For example, the World Health 
Organization (WHO) described life skills as 

The most 
important 
indicator of 
progress in 
opportunities 
to acquire 
foundation 
skills is access 
to secondary 
school

111

GOAL 3: YOUTH AND ADULT SKILLSDefining skills‘a group of psychosocial competencies and 
interpersonal skills that help people make 
informed decisions, solve problems, think 
critically and creatively, communicate effectively, 
build healthy relationships, empathise with 
others and cope with and manage their lives in 
a healthy and productive manner’ (WHO, 2003). 
The Interagency Working Group on Life Skills 
in EFA stated that life skills are ‘cross-cutting 
applications of knowledge, values, attitudes 
and skills that are important in the process of 
individual development and lifelong learning 
(UNESCO, 2004). In short, life skills were 
perceived as necessary to promote good health 
in oneself and one’s family, and to maximize 
one’s contributions as a citizen, beyond just 
earning a livelihood. 

The 2012 GMR, subtitled ‘Youth and Skills: 
Putting Education to Work’, focused on skills for 
employment – sometimes also called ‘livelihood 
skills’ – that could be considered ‘foundation’, 
‘transferable’ or ‘technical and vocational’. 
Foundation skills, as they relate to employment, 
are those needed to obtain work or continued 
training and include literacy and numeracy skills. 
Transferable skills are the broader range of skills 
that can be transferred and adapted to different 
work environments, and allow people to retain 
employment. They also include the capabilities 
to analyse problems, reach creative solutions, 
communicate ideas, and exercise collaboration, 
leadership and entrepreneurship. Skills include 
what are sometimes called ‘socio-emotional’ and 
non-cognitive competencies that can be acquired 
both through experience and education. In one 
sense, TVET skills are the specific technical 
know-how related to particular work activities, 
whether growing vegetables, using a sewing 
machine, engaging in bricklaying or carpentry, or 
working on a computer in an office. In a broader 
sense, such skills also can be seen as life skills.

Foundation skills:  
Participation in secondary 
education has increased

Foundation skills include the literacy and 
numeracy skills necessary for decent work 
that pays enough to meet daily needs. These 
foundation skills are also needed to obtain 

further education and training. People who 
cannot read, write and do basic arithmetic have 
fewer opportunities for gainful employment, 
entrepreneurial activity or civic participation. 
Foundation skills obtained in secondary school 
can also be considered essential for career 
advancement, active citizenship and safe choices 
about personal health. These are important 
reasons why many countries have enacted 
policies or laws making both primary education 
and lower secondary education free and 
compulsory (Benavot and Resnick, 2006). 

Although there has been some progress in 
directly assessing foundation skills, there is 
currently no such global measure. In light of 
this, an important proxy indicator of progress on 
goal 3 is access to secondary education. Those 
who gain access to secondary schooling are also 
more likely to participate in adult education and 
lifelong learning programmes.

It is also essential to monitor access to 
secondary education because equitable access 
would fulfil an EFA commitment to marginalized 
people who have difficulty accessing good 
learning environments or obtaining skills outside 
school. This may be partly because they lack the 
personal connections to do so and, if they live 
in rural areas, they may be farther away from 
opportunities for employment. 

An increasing number of adolescents who reach 
the end of the primary school cycle have made 
the transition into lower secondary school. 
Some countries made rapid gains before Dakar. 
For example, in Cabo Verde and Tunisia, the 
transition rate into secondary school increased 
from less than 40% of primary school graduates 
in 1990 to about 70% by 1999. However, for many 
countries such as Djibouti, Senegal and Nepal, 
progress was far faster after 2000 (Figure 3.1).

As a result of increasing transition rates and 
higher retention rates, participation in lower 
and upper secondary education has increased 
fast since 1999, particularly in poorer countries. 
The lower secondary education gross enrolment 
ratio has increased by at least 27 percentage 
points in Afghanistan, China, Ecuador, Mali and 
Morocco. In Mozambique, enrolment increased 
by almost five times from 7% in 1999 to 34% in 
2012. Large increases have also been observed 
in upper secondary education participation.

skills obtained 
in secondary 
school are

for career 
advancement, 
active 
citizenship, 
and safe 
choices about

health

Source: Annex, Statistical Table 7.

The gross enrolment ratio increased from 
6% to 28% in Guinea and to 50% in Bhutan 
between 1999 and 2012. It almost doubled from 
about 40% to about 75% in Indonesia and the 
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela over the period 
(Figure 3.2).

As over-age enrolment and repetition rates 
in primary education have declined since 
2000, more of those lower secondary school 
age adolescents who are in school are in fact 
enrolled in lower secondary school and not 
over-age primary school students. In El Salvador, 
where the total lower secondary school net 
enrolment ratio increased from 77% to 91%, 
the proportion of those adolescents enrolled in 
primary school fell from 32% to 26% between 
2000 and 2012.

Many countries have expanded basic 
education to include lower secondary

Several factors contributed to the expansion 
of lower secondary enrolment. The abolition of 
school fees at this level – as earlier with primary 
school fees – led more children to access 
secondary schools. This was accompanied 
in some countries by changes in the legal 
frameworks to assure basic education. Analysis 

of documents in the UNESCO Right to Education 
Database indicates that 94 out of the 107 low and 
middle income countries have legislated free 
lower secondary education (UNESCO, 2014d). Of 
these, 66 have constitutional guarantees and 28 
enacted other legal measures. As of 2015, only a 
few nations charge lower secondary school fees, 
including Botswana, Guinea, Papua New Guinea, 
South Africa and the United Republic of Tanzania.

In addition to suspending lower secondary school 
fees, two out of three countries where lower 
secondary education was not compulsory in 2000 
had changed their legislation by 2012. Among 
those countries that legislated compulsory lower 
secondary education since Dakar were India, 
Indonesia, Nigeria and Pakistan. As of 2012, only 
25 countries have no legal requirement for lower 
secondary attendance, including Iraq, Malaysia 
and Nicaragua. 

Along with establishing extended basic education 
as a legal norm, more countries suspended 
primary school leaving examinations that 
determined whether a child could continue 
schooling and in which track. However, some 
countries still retain them. In Asia, Indonesia, 
the Islamic Republic of Iran, Mongolia, Sri Lanka 
and Thailand have such examinations (Hill, 2013).

Among the most significant factors behind the 
increased demand for secondary schooling was 
the rising rate of primary education completion in 
many countries, thus enabling larger cohorts to 
become eligible for continued study. In Thailand, 
which extended compulsory education in its 1999 
National Education Act and 2003 Compulsory 
Education Act, the achievement of compulsory 
universal primary education eventually led to 
increased pressure on the government to greatly 
expand access to the lower secondary level.

The slow growth of publicly provided secondary 
education likely spurred a heightened demand 
for and interest in private alternatives. Between 
1999 and 2012, the percentage of enrolments 
in private secondary institutions rose from 
15% to 17% in developing countries; increases 
were especially pronounced in the Arab States 
and East Asia. And, as private schools sought 
students, they further accelerated the public’s 
demand for secondary schooling.

Two out of 
three countries 
where lower 
secondary 
education 
was not 
compulsory 
in 2000 had 
changed their 
legislation by 
2012

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 31025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportThe Dakar Framework for Action may have 
also helped establish and legitimize domestic 
institutions and civil society organizations 
that promoted the right to lower secondary 
education. Senegal, as shown in Figure 3.2, had 
the most notable change in the transition rate 
from primary to lower secondary. Its transition 
rate was only 24% in 1990 and 35% in 1999. But 
by 2011 it had reached 88%. This change should 
not be surprising, given that Senegal hosted 
the World Education Forum in 2000, and in 2004 
extended free and compulsory education to 
include lower secondary. The Dakar Framework 
was also influential in encouraging dialogue 
with traditional religious actors who had been 
resistant to what they viewed as Western 
forms of education. Increased dialogue helped 
generate support for legal reforms in 2004 and 
facilitate the incorporation of religious schools 
in the formal education system, thus maximizing 
the enrolment of lower secondary school-aged 
children (Villalón and Bodian, 2012).

Inequality persists in lower 
secondary education

Along with expanding access to secondary 
education, it is necessary to examine the equity 
of its distribution. As access to secondary 
schooling becomes gradually universal, it is 
usually obtained first by advantaged groups 
and only later by the marginalized and poor 
(Buchmann and Hannum, 2001; Foster, 1977; 
Hout and DiPrete, 2006; Kelley and Klein, 1977; 
Shavit and Blossfeld, 1993).

Even when low income, minority language or 
other marginalized groups achieve access to 
lower secondary education, further differentiation 
is likely between higher and lower quality 
schools, sometimes through the emergence of 
private schools. Further differentiation will also 
likely appear in the transition to the next level: 
unequal access to lower secondary means upper 
secondary remains or becomes a source of 
inequality. This pattern is found even in countries 
that promise educational opportunity to children 
irrespective of ability to pay.

Analysis of household survey data reveals 
differences between children from the 
richest and poorest households in low and 
middle income countries in the likelihood of 
transitioning from primary to lower secondary 
and from lower secondary to upper secondary 
school (Figure 3.3). In some countries, like 
Colombia, Malawi, Pakistan and the Philippines, 
gaps between wealth groups did not change 
very noticeably. In the Philippines, only 69% 
of adolescents from the poorest households 
who reached the end of primary school 
continued into lower secondary school in 2008 
compared with 94% of adolescents from the 
richest households, a situation hardly different 
relative to 2003. 

In a few countries, however, including Indonesia 
and Rwanda, the gap in transition between 
children from wealthier and poorer households 
obviously closed. In Rwanda, the poorest 
adolescents who reached the end of primary 
school and made the transition into lower 
secondary school increased from just 15% in 
2000 to 58% in 2010, more than halving the gap 
separating them from their wealthiest peers.

Inequalities also remain in the attainment 
of lower secondary education, for example 
according to where adolescents live. In a 
few countries the rural–urban gap in lower 
secondary school attainment has substantially 
reduced. In Nepal, there was a gap in attainment 
rate of about 35 percentage points in 2001 with 
only 27% of adolescents graduating from lower 
secondary school in rural areas. By 2011, the 
gap had fallen to about 20 percentage points 
with 58% of adolescents graduating from lower 
secondary school in rural areas. 

In other countries, inequalities remained 
or even increased, as urban children 
advanced faster than did rural children in 
terms of lower secondary attainment. In the 
Lao People’s Democratic Republic, the rural–
urban lower secondary education attainment 
gap increased from 29 to 42 percentage points 
between 2000 and 2011. In 2011, just 23% 
of rural adolescents graduated from lower 
secondary school compared with 65% of urban 
ones (Figure 3.4).

As secondary 
schooling 
becomes 
universal, it is 
obtained first 
by advantaged 
groups and only 
later by the 
marginalized 
and poor

Access to secondary school has been an 
issue for marginalized groups

Goal 3 affirms that education opportunities for 
skill acquisition must be equitable. Like the 
hard-to-reach groups discussed in Chapter 2, 
working children and migrants are two important 
groups whose access to secondary education 
and acquisition of skills can be monitored. 

Working adolescents have continued to face 
major challenges

In some rich economies, many young students 
work for fun, learning or discretionary income. 
However, in most of the world, work by children 
and adolescents is associated with household 
poverty and the lack of disposable income. Since 
the adoption of the Worst Forms of Child Labour 
Convention in 1999 (No. 182), the International 
Labour Organization (ILO) and its International 
Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour 
have focused on the most intolerable forms of 
child labour rather than holding countries to 

the stringent demands of the ILO Minimum Age 
Convention of 1973 (No. 138), which effectively 
prohibits most work during the ages when 
schooling is compulsory. 

As compulsory education became 
institutionalized, and as opportunities for 
low-skill work declined, there was a global 
shift of children’s activity from jobs and into 
school. However, universalizing attendance 
will not necessarily reduce the need to or the 
reality of work for many young people. Many 
children who continue their studies past primary 
education do not do so exclusively, and increased 
lower secondary school participation rates do 
not necessarily reduce children’s economic 
activity correspondingly. 

Analysis of survey data shows that even as 
countries increased school coverage, many saw 
persisting rates of part-time work by students. 
Substantial proportions of adolescents of 
secondary school age continued to work outside 
of school in most of the 16 countries analysed

(Figure 3.5). Many young people worked 
exclusively and many others combined work 
with schooling, though patterns differ across 
countries. In Cameroon, about 70% of students 
aged 12 to 14 worked in 2001 with little change 
observed by 2011.2 By contrast, the percentage 
of working students aged 12 to 14 fell from 80% 
to 47% over the same period in Togo. Likewise, 
in Senegal there was a decline in the proportion 
of students who worked, even as school 
participation increased. The more hours children 
work per week, the less likely they are to attend 
school, and those who do attend are more 
likely to lag in the years of schooling they attain 
(Understanding Children’s Work, 2015). 

The percentages of students who must work 
while studying are likely to be underestimated. 
Parents, who usually provide information about 
children’s activities, may be reluctant to tell 
interviewers that children are working, especially 
if it is considered illegal by international 
standards. Student self-reports of their 
employment status are higher. GMR analysis of 
the 2007 Trends in International Mathematics 
and Science Study (TIMSS) for Indonesia found 
that 30% of grade 8 students stated that they 
worked for pay during the school week, well 
above the estimate based on parents’ responses 
shown in Figure 3.5.

2. The term ‘work’, as used here, does not include the many domestic 
responsibilities and tasks at home, often done by girls, since this is 
considered ‘non-economic activity’ in labour force surveys. Other types of 
surveys that report domestic responsibilities typically find more children 
who are working, especially girls, than are included in Figure 3.5 under the 
‘employment’ category.

Working students lag in acquiring foundation 
skills. For example, as part of the 2003 and 
2007 TIMSS, working grade 8 students in Egypt 
scored about 70 points below their non-working 
peers in science proficiency (Figure 3.6). 
Policies can soften the impact: the negative 
association between student employment 
and academic performance is smaller among 
students whose countries had ratified the ILO 
Minimum Age Convention by the year they began 
their schooling, probably because of labour 
protections in these countries (Byun et al., 2014).

Other differences between working and non-
working students, apart from whether they 
work, complicate interpretation of differences in 
cognitive skills. Weaker students may voluntarily 
work, or weaker students might be pushed to 
find work by the economic circumstances of 
their family (Post and Pong, 2009a). It was found 
in the United States that intensive employment 
in itself reduces measurable cognitive skills 
(Greenberger and Steinberg, 1986; Marsh, 1991; 
Marsh and Kleitman, 2005; McNeal, 1997). Yet, 
negative effects of working while at school 
for skills acquisition were found even after 
controlling for family resources (Gunnarsson et 
al., 2006; Heady, 2000). Working students’ skills 
increase less in secondary school than those of 
full-time students, even if prior skill levels are 
taken into account (Post and Pong, 2000, 2009b).

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 31025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportMigrant youth need equitable access to skills

Increasingly, the world is witness to 
unprecedented human mobility: in 2010, 
an estimated 214 million people migrated 
internationally (World Bank, 2011b). About 
three-quarters of international migrants 
originate in the Global South; an estimated 
147 million to 174 million migrants were born in 
developing countries (International Organization 
for Migration (IOM), 2013). Labour demand, 
economic crises, urbanization, entrenched 
poverty, political instability and conflict 
have contributed to migration since Dakar 
(Bartlett 2015). 

Addressing the needs of migrants and 
providing them with basic skills have become 
pressing concerns in all regions (see Box 3.1). 
International migrants, in particular, face 
more challenges than their native-born peers 
in obtaining equitable access to learning 
opportunities and life skills. Several systemic 
factors – for example, legal status, segregation, 
school finance and language policy – affect 
access to both formal and non-formal education 
(Bartlett, 2015).

Young people and families with young children 
have been particularly mobile, both across and 

within nations, especially from less developed 
to more developed regions. In more affluent 
countries, UN estimations show 15.7% of people 
under age 20 were immigrants in 1990, and the 
share had increased to 18.9% by 2013 (United 
Nations, 2013). Access to education is not always 
guaranteed to migrant youth, especially those 
with irregular legal status. A survey of migration 
policies in 28 countries, including 14 developed 
countries with high rates of human development 
and 14 developing countries with lower human 
development scores, found that 40% of the 
former and more than 50% of the latter did 
not allow children with irregular status access 
to schooling (Klugman and Pereira, 2009). In 
addition to formal restrictions, migrants with 
irregular status may avoid formal schooling 
for fear of detention or deportation (Bartlett, 
2015). It is difficult to determine how many 
displaced children and youth are denied access 
to schooling, but estimates from 2004 suggested 
at least 27 million children and young people 
affected by armed conflict were not in school, the 
vast majority of whom were internally displaced 
(Ferris and Winthrop, 2010)

Moreover, deportation policies adversely affect 
migrants and their education opportunities. 
Several countries have expanded the number 
of offences that result in deportation and have 

Box 3.1: Contrasting approaches to south–south migrants in Ecuador and the Dominican Republic

Due to an internal economic crisis and intensification 
of armed conflict in Colombia, between 1999 and 2004 
Ecuador experienced increased immigration. Nearly 
60,000 Colombians were living in Ecuador by 2013, 
leading to policy challenges including separated families, 
children without parental care and growing numbers of 
asylum seekers. Ecuador addressed these through its 
2008 constitution, which, taking a human rights approach, 
incorporated notions of universal citizenship, free circulation 
of people, and migrants as deserving full access to services 
provided by the state. Since 2012, migrant children and youth 
in Ecuador have no longer been defined as foreigners, but 
rather as ‘vulnerable’, with special needs related to ‘human 
mobility’. Under the new constitution, Ecuador is committed 
to guarantee that private, public and religious schools will 
provide support and adapt the learning environment to 
satisfy the needs of this population.

The Dominican Republic and Haiti share the island of 
Hispaniola and a 380 kilometre border. The Dominican 
Republic faces pressures because the politically influential 

members of the Dominican economic elite rely upon (and 
therefore tolerate) Haitian immigrant labour, but anti-Haitian 
sentiment flares regularly. In 2005, the Inter-American Human 
Rights Court ruled that the Dominican Republic had to comply 
with its 2002 constitution, which guaranteed access to 
education for all children, regardless of immigration status. 
Since that ruling, the government has generally encouraged 
primary schools to allow all children to register. Nevertheless, 
birth certificates are required for secondary school students, 
cutting short the education of thousands of children. Until 
2010, Article 11 of the Dominican constitution guaranteed 
citizenship to almost anyone born on its territory. Then the 
constitution was changed so that citizenship is reserved for 
children born in the country to at least one parent who is a 
‘legal resident’. In 2013, a Dominican high court denationalized 
unauthorized people of Haitian descent born in the Dominican 
Republic since 1929. The denial of birth certificates and 
national identification cards has led to the denial of other 
rights, including the right to basic education.

GOAL 3: YOUTH AND ADULT SKILLSInequality persists in lower secondary educationsignificantly increased the number of migrants 
deported. Detention and deportation disrupt the 
schooling of children, not only if the children 
themselves are subject but if their parents are 
instead (Chaudry et al., 2010).

Meeting the specific needs of migrant students 
requires extra financial resources that are 
put to effective use (Brind et al., 2008). In the 
Netherlands, the Educational Priority Policy 
provided additional funding for poorer and 
ethnic minority students (Karsten, 2006). The 
British Excellence in Cities programme, for 
students living in disadvantaged urban areas 
where many migrants reside, provides support 
for teaching and learning, mentors, and 
information and communication technology 
(ICT), with some positive results (Kendall 
et al., 2005).

Language education policies and support for 
language learning is essential for the education 
of immigrant youth and their future engagement 
with the labour market (Christensen and Stanat, 
2007). According to the OECD’s Programme 
for International Student Assessment (PISA), 
in most countries, immigrants who speak the 
language of instruction at home maintain an 
estimated half a grade level advantage on 
average in mathematics over those who speak 
a different language at home, with an even 
greater gap in reading (Christensen and Stanat, 
2007; Schnepf, 2004). This partly accounts for 
the fact that in most OECD countries, except 
Australia and Canada, first-generation migrants 
trail on average their native-born peers by 
about 1.5 school years in PISA assessments 
(Nusche, 2009). 

Many institutional factors affect the education 
of immigrant youth, including support for early 
childhood education; age of school entry; the 
prominence, timing and consequences of ability 
grouping or tracking; school quality; rigour; 
diversity and responsiveness of curricula and 
pedagogies; and openness to cultural and 
religious diversity (Crul and Holdaway, 2009). 
A project that compared second-generation 
Turkish and Moroccan immigrants in six 
European countries showed that institutional 
arrangements, including the starting age for 
compulsory schooling, contact hours in primary 
school, timing of tracking, and apprenticeships 
made critical differences for immigrant 

students (Crul and Holdaway, 2009; Crul and 
Vermeulen, 2003).

The challenges facing domestic migrants have 
often been seen in the context of poor education 
provision in urban slum areas. Their education 
needs have received somewhat less attention, 
perhaps partly because the intensity of internal 
migration is slightly declining across the globe 
(United Nations Department of Economic and 
Social Affairs, 2013).  However, unprecedented 
rates of domestic migration in China, which had 
already taken place during the 1990s, created 
enormous pressure on the Chinese education 
system to respond (Box 3.2).

Transferable skills: Skills 
and values that matter for 
social progress

In addition to goal 3’s pledge to make sure youth 
and adults received equitable opportunities for 
learning and life skills, the Dakar Framework 
for Action stated: ‘All young people and adults 
must be given the opportunity to gain the 
knowledge and develop the values, attitudes 
and skills that will enable them to develop their 
capacities to work, to participate fully in their 
society, to take control of their own lives and to 
continue learning.’

Monitoring this broad goal requires information 
on values, attitudes and non-academic skills 
that are neither internationally assessed nor 
reported by national education systems. 

First, with support from the Republic of Korea, 
UNESCO has attempted to identify the type 
of life skills necessary for global citizenship. 
Core elements of an education to develop 
global citizenship include: (1) knowledge and 
understanding of specific global issues and 
trends, and knowledge of and respect for key 
universal values (e.g. peace, human rights, 
diversity, justice, democracy, caring, non-
discrimination, tolerance); (2) cognitive skills 
for critical, creative and innovative thinking, 
problem-solving and decision-making; (3) 
non-cognitive skills such as empathy, openness 
to experiences and other perspectives, 
interpersonal and communication skills, and

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 31025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportBox 3.2: Rural–urban migration: The policy challenge to schooling and China’s response

The largest migration in human history has occurred since Dakar, 
involving hundreds of millions of Chinese people moving from 
the rural interior to China’s cities (Chan, 2013). The scale of this 
movement has had profound implications for equitable opportunities 
for rural children. At the time of the Dakar Forum, rural migrants 
faced severe challenges due to China’s household registration 
system (hukou), but the country has taken steps to promote their 
schooling in recent years. These policy reforms contributed to global 
progress on goal 3 because of the large numbers of migrant youth 
affected. Established in the 1950s, the hukou system binds Chinese 
citizens’ rights with their hukou registration place (Chan and Zhang, 
1999). Until the mid-1980s, internal migration of rural citizens was 
not allowed, and there were grave educational consequences for 
the children of parents who migrated illegally. However, China then 

gradually relaxed its migration prohibitions, as the vast wave of rural–
urban migration unfolded (Hao, 2012). The historical implications for 
migration and education policies are vast (Table 3.1).

At the time of the Dakar meeting, restrictions on public education 
for those without hukou status created a market of substandard 
private schools serving rural migrant children in cities. In 2000, these 
schools were profit-driven, had poor infrastructure and offered very 
low quality education (Han, 2004), thus reinforcing the rural–urban 
educational divide. Children whom migrant parents left behind 
attended inferior rural schools, and children who accompanied their 
parents to urban areas faced either high guest fees in urban public 
schools or low quality education in substandard private schools 
serving migrant children.

GOAL 3: YOUTH AND ADULT SKILLSTransferable skills: Skills and values that matter for social progressBox 3.2 (continued)

A national policy in 2001 was a turning point in the central 
government’s approach to serving children of rural–urban 
migrants. The policy transferred the responsibility for 
financing the education of migrants from the government of 
the locality where the children had originated to that of the 
locality where they arrived. 

A 2006 amendment to the 1986 Compulsory Education 
law stated that local governments should provide migrant 
children living out of their hukou with equal conditions in 
compulsory education. This amendment facilitated a central 
government policy of 2008 that explicitly abolished fees at 
public schools for rural migrant children.

With public financing shifted to receiving areas, innovative 
policy measures were developed to help existing urban 
schools with limited enrolment capacity to absorb the ever-
growing migrant student body. In recent years, the central 
government has set aside funds for the schooling of migrant 
children to support local governments bearing the receiving 
responsibility. In addition, policies of 2006 and 2008 specified 
that local governments should fund public education according 
to the actual number of students (including migrant students) 
rather than the past criterion of students from the local hukou.

Like urban-born students, an overwhelming majority of 
rural migrant children now attend urban public schools with 
sufficient facilities and manageable class sizes. The reform 
seems to be enabling migrant children to experience relative 
success in urban schools compared with their peers in rural 
schools. China thus has moved closer to offering equitable 
opportunities in its urban areas. A nationally representative 
sample of over 22,000 students in 112 schools showed 
migrant children performing below their non-migrant peers 
in urban schools. Nevertheless, they scored about one-third 
higher than their rural peers, especially those left behind 
in villages when their parents had migrated to work in 
urban areas. 

Of even greater concern is the performance of rural students 
overall, which lags far behind that of urban students, 
even including those who originated from rural areas and 
were from similar social backgrounds. There are still large 
differences in quality between rural and urban schools, but 
rural migrant children to China’s cities are now benefiting 
from equitable finance laws that enable them to attend 
good schools.

aptitude for networking and interacting with 
people of different backgrounds and origins; and 
(4) behavioural capacity to launch and engage in 
proactive actions (UNESCO, 2013b).

A second attempt to expand the concept of 
skills beyond cognitive or livelihood skills was 
launched by the OECD (2014k) as part of its 
three year Education for Social Progress project. 
The OECD used longitudinal data collected in 
11 countries to identify the causal effects of 
skills on a variety of measures of individuals’ life 
success. It concluded that ‘social and emotional 
skills such as perseverance, sociability and 
self-confidence drive numerous measures 
of social outcome including cognitive skills, 
health and well-being. Social and emotional 
skills are malleable, and there are roles for 
policy-makers, teachers and parents to play in 
improving the learning environment.’ The OECD 
is planning a cross-national longitudinal study 
that will one day allow social and emotional 
skills to be measured directly and assessed for 
their impact on an individual’s lifetime success 
including individual well-being, active citizenship 
and employment.

While it is not possible to monitor the range of 
characteristics covered by goal 3, this section 

sheds light on two types of life skills that are 
relevant to health and society. It also examines 
two attempts to improve understanding of life 
skills, which demonstrate how such skills are 
formulated and what a monitoring framework 
might entail.

Knowledge on HIV and AIDS has increased 
but is far from universal 

In Dakar, WHO called for a goal centred on life 
skills, which it defined (WHO, 2003) as ‘abilities 
for adaptive and positive behaviour that enable 
individuals to deal effectively with the demands 
and challenges of everyday life.’ WHO further 
supported skills that help youth make informed 
decisions, communicate effectively and manage 
their lives in a healthy way. Since the 2013/14 
GMR, further evidence has emerged that 
secondary education confers more advantages 
than primary education when it comes 
to life skills.

AIDS was a grave and growing danger when 
the convenors of the Dakar Forum pressed for 
greater emphasis on life skills. The next year, 
the United Nations General Assembly Special 
Session (UNGASS) adopted a Declaration of 
Commitment on HIV/AIDS and established 

122

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 31025Education for All Global Monitoring Reporta core indicator (indicator 11) for monitoring 
life skills based on HIV education in schools. 
(UNESCO, 2014a).

The UNGASS goal was that, by 2010, at least 
95% of men and women aged 15 to 24 would 
have access to the information, youth-specific 
HIV education and services necessary to 
develop the life skills required to reduce their 
vulnerability to HIV. 

It is now possible to look at progress in  
17 countries where, in two waves of household 
surveys, young people took a brief test of 
knowledge regarding two ways to prevent 
HIV infection and whether they believed three 
prevalent misconceptions. Since the first wave, 
the most recent surveys indicate improvements 
in HIV and AIDS knowledge among young men 
in 9 countries and among young women in 
13 countries (Figure 3.7). This change suggests 
countries succeeded in a concerted effort over a 
relatively short time. The countries showing the 
greatest improvement appear to be those where 
HIV was most prevalent. It is likely that schools 
have taken HIV education more seriously in 
these countries, and that life skills education has 
played a role. In recent years, most countries 
have reported that their schools offered at least 
30 hours of life skills programmes, although it 
is not possible to determine how often schools 
specifically offered HIV education (Clarke and 
Aggleton, 2012).

sexuality rather than the risks associated 
with sex, an evolution from moralistic earlier 
approaches that were based on fear and 
considered learners as passive recipients of 
information (UNESCO, 2014a).

Attitudes towards gender equality have not 
consistently improved

Goal 3 is not only about skills but also about the 
values and attitudes that improve individual lives 
and social cohesion. One of the values that EFA 
prioritizes is gender equality. For over 20 years, 
the World Values Survey (WVS) has included a 
question that indirectly allows an analysis of adult 
attitudes to gender equality across countries and 
over time. In particular, respondents have been 
asked whether they agree with the statement 
that ‘a university education is more important for 
men than for women.’ 

Comparing responses over time shows that 
there is no consistent global trend (Figure 
3.8). In some countries, respondents in 
recent years were more likely reveal positive 
attitudes towards gender equality. In Ukraine, 
the percentage of those with positive attitudes 
increased from 64% in 1996 to 83% in 2011. But 
in other countries, there was no change, and in 
still others attitudes towards gender equality 
deteriorated. In Pakistan, the percentage of 
those with positive attitudes decreased from 77% 
in 2001 to just 48% in 2012. 

Comprehensive sexuality education has gained 
widespread support as a platform for HIV 
prevention. The new emphasis is on healthy 

Further analysis of the WVS data for this GMR 
also offers a provocative look at the relation 
between public attitudes towards higher

GOAL 3: YOUTH AND ADULT SKILLSTransferable skills: Skills and values that matter for social progresseducation and respondents’ gender and level of 
education. Women were more likely than men to 
disagree with the statement in most countries. 
And people with secondary education were more 
egalitarian towards higher education for women 
than people with less than secondary education.

Stronger evidence of link between 
education and political efficacy 

The 2013/14 GMR reported evidence of the 
positive impact of secondary education attainment 
on other important attitudes and values – for 
example, tolerance for diversity and support for 
democratic institutions. Recent evidence from 
PIAAC showed that literacy and educational 
attainment each have independent effects on 
political efficacy and civic engagement (OECD, 
2013b). In OECD countries, people who completed 
at least secondary education were also more likely 
to report they were much more likely to engage 
in volunteer activities in their communities. The 
survey shows that higher skill levels and more 
education each had positive independent effects 
on adults’ willingness to engage in the political 
process. Adults who completed more schooling 
and who responded to the PIAAC survey were less 
likely to agree that ‘people like me don’t have any 
say about what the government does’ and likely to 

disagree that ‘there are only a few people you can 
trust completely’ (OECD, 2013b).

Education alternatives are 
needed for youth and adults 
who are no longer in school

Beyond the expansion of formal schooling, goal 
3 is a reminder that countries have committed 
themselves to meeting the education needs of 
out-of-school youth and of adults whose formal 
education opportunities were cut short. An 
array of alternative, ‘second chance’ and non-
formal programmes can be cited as examples 
of progress in this area (Duke and Hinzen, 
2008). Prominent examples can also be seen in 
Bangladesh, India and Thailand (Banerji, 2015).

In Bangladesh, BRAC programmes aim to bring 
out-of-school children into the primary education 
system and prepare them for the secondary level. 
More than 97% of BRAC primary school graduates 
continue to formal secondary school. However, 
many BRAC graduates cannot complete their 
secondary education due to poverty. Therefore, 
BRAC representatives conduct regular follow-
up meetings with children, guardians, teachers

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 31025Education for All Global Monitoring Reportand school committee members, and BRAC 
provides financial support to poor primary school 
graduates. BRAC graduates are encouraged 
to join clubs where they have opportunities for 
reading, sports and cultural activities, and where 
they receive life skill and livelihood training. 
BRAC also has a new initiative, Skills Training for 
Advancing Resources, in which adolescents who 
dropped out of school are helped to gain skills 
and enter the job market.

In India, the National Institute of Open Schooling 
(NIOS) was established in 1990 with ‘authority to 
register, examine and certify students registered 
with it up to pre-degree courses.’ NIOS offers 
‘open basic education programmes’ for those 
aged 14 and older. Courses and certification are 
geared for levels that are equivalent to grades 
3, 5 and 8 in the formal system (Banerji, 2015). 
Learners also have access to vocational courses 
and life enrichment programmes that lead to 
secondary and higher secondary certification 
examinations. For senior and secondary levels, 
NIOS allows choices of academic and vocational 
courses and flexibility in sitting examinations, 
with up to nine chances over five years. For 
academic courses beyond the basic level, there 
are close to 4,000 study centres run by accredited 
institutions and just under 2,000 accredited 
vocational institutions. Enrolment figures and 
the number of certified learners have risen 
steadily over the years. As of 2011, NIOS statistics 
indicate a cumulative total of 2.2 million students. 
Since 2007, the number of females has been 
significantly higher than that of males. NIOS is 
often called the world’s largest open school. 

Also in India, the Pratham Open School of 
Education (POSE) aims to reach young girls and 
women who have been marginalized from the 
mainstream education system and give them 
a second chance to complete their schooling. 
Started in 2011 as a residential programme, today 
it has expanded to seven states and provides a 
three month condensed foundation course to 
bridge the gap between basic concepts and the 
secondary school curriculum. This is followed 
by an examination to shortlist candidates for the 
second phase of classes, where students prepare 
for the state board exams. POSE also addresses 
aspects like personality development and focuses 
on enhancing soft skills such as articulation, 
confidence and self-expression. The larger goal 
is to better equip students to enter the workforce 
and be well placed in society. POSE leverages 

its students to increase its outreach, requiring 
them to teach basic math and language to 
children at the primary level in their villages and 
communities. So far, POSE students have taught 
20,000 primary school children.

Thailand produced a National EFA Action Plan 
to run parallel to the National Education Plan 
(2002–2016). EFA goals 3 and 4 were combined 
into a composite goal focusing on adult literacy 
and on basic and continuing education for all 
adults. This created an alternative not only for 
the disadvantaged, but for all people not in a 
position to attend formal schooling, such as 
prison inmates, street children and Thai nationals 
living abroad. Moreover, it expanded from 
literacy and primary education to an extensive 
network of education provision, including 
secondary education, vocational training, life 
skills through distance learning, workplace and 
community learning centres, and the joint sharing 
of resources with the formal school system. 
Skill-related programmes are planned and 
implemented in collaboration with other sector 
ministries (Hoppers, 2008).

Unfortunately, little systematic assessment of 
these non-formal education alternatives for  
out-of-school adolescents and youth has been 
carried out, either immediate outcomes or  
long-term impact. The task is made more difficult 
by the fact that much monitoring and evaluation 
work is controlled by the sponsoring agencies, 
and the assessments they produce may not be 
relevant for policy and planning.

An example of good practice can be found in  
the rigorous evaluation of Ishraq (‘sunrise’), 
a second-chance programme for adolescent 
girls in Upper Egypt (Population Council, 2013). 
Ishraq was launched in 2001 in four villages 
in Egypt’s Menya governorate, ranked second 
to last among 27 on the Human Development 
Index. The programme included literacy training 
for out-of-school girls aged 12 to 15, as well 
as a curriculum of life skills developed by the 
Center for Development and Population Activities 
and other NGOs.

By 2008, the programme had succeeded in 
preparing most girls for Egypt’s Adult Education 
Agency exam (with an 81% pass rate) and 
encouraging them to enter or re-enter formal 
schools. To assess the long-term impact of Ishraq 
on life skills, the Population Council matched

past participants with young women who did 
not participate but were similar in important 
background characteristics, including income 
level and formal education. The young women 
who participated in Ishraq were found to have 
acquired greater self-esteem, locus of control, 
and confidence in decision-making than peers 
who did not participate. Ishraq’s graduates 
also developed different attitudes than non-
participants towards desired family size and were 
more likely to want to delay marriage until at 
least age 18.

Technical and vocational skills: 
Approaches are evolving

Secondary school helped me explore my areas of 
interest and it did impact what I do today, though 
not substantially. On-the-job training, rather than 
academic institutions, helped me acquire the skills 
I have today. 

Naim Keruwala (26), Student, India

Technical and vocational skills can be acquired 
through work placement programmes linked to 
secondary schooling and formal technical and 
vocational education, or through work-based 
training, including traditional apprenticeships 
and training through agricultural cooperatives. 
However, as yet there is no global storehouse of 
information about training taking place outside 
the authority of education ministries. 

In the absence of such comprehensive 
information, the school-related data given to 
the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) make 
it at least possible to take stock of change 
inside nations’ secondary schools. There are 
28 countries that show substantial gains or 
declines in the percentages of students enrolled 
in vocational tracks as opposed to general tracks 
relative to total secondary enrolment: in 12 of 
these the share increased, and in 16 it decreased. 
There appears to be no regional pattern in these 
changes (Figure 3.9).

It is also useful to recall that the origin of the 
EFA movement in Jomtien coincided with a

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 31025Education for All Global Monitoring Reportcritical review of TVET by one of the conference’s 
conveners, the World Bank (Middleton et al., 
1991). This review convinced many countries and 
donors that skill training prior to labour force 
entry would yield positive returns only if training 
was tied to demand. Skill training alone did not 
create jobs. The emphasis on basic skills in 
EFA prompted a rethinking of TVET’s purposes. 
Many countries downsized this part of the sector, 
especially as TVET models in former Socialist 
countries became less influential after the 
Cold War ended.

Thus, at the time of the Dakar conference, there 
were few advocates of technical and vocational 
skills (King, 2011, 2013). In retrospect, it is 
surprising that in the entire Dakar Framework 
for Action, no reference or mention can 
be found of either the 1989 Convention on 
Technical and Vocational Education or the 1999 
Recommendations of the Second International 
Congress on Technical and Vocational Education 
in Seoul.3 After Dakar, no efforts were made 
to delegate responsibility for the collection of 
information on the many public and private 
providers of TVET, on skills learned outside the 
education system, or on non-formal or continuing 
adult education experiences on the job.

However, there has been much greater attention 
to TVET in recent years. In the European Union, a 
focus on training since 1994 was accelerated after 
2008, led by the European Training Foundation 
(ETF) in Turin, Italy. In 2010, the ETF launched the 
Torino Process, including a review of vocational 
education and training policies and systems in all 
its partner countries.

Another important driver of change has been 
the OECD, which from 2007 to 2010 conducted 
Learning for Jobs, a review of initial vocational 
education and training in 17 countries (OECD, 
2010a). This was followed by Skills Beyond 
School, an OECD policy review that is analysing 
information on post-secondary vocational 
education and training, and assessing the 
preparation of youth and adults for technical 
and professional jobs. It considers international 
differences in factors such as responsiveness to 
labour market needs, inclusion, career guidance, 
finance, governance, teaching quality and 
workplace learning.

3. It is also noteworthy that UNESCO’s Revised Recommendation concerning 
Technical and Vocational Education (2001) makes no reference to the EFA 
movement or the EFA goals adopted just one year earlier.

A third impetus for renewed focus on skills 
came from the ILO, which in 2004 adopted 
Recommendation 195, a broader and less 
institutionalized view of human resource 
development than that seen in the ILO Vocational 
Training Recommendations of 1962 and 1975. 
The new recommendation considers education, 
training and lifelong learning, defining the 
last as encompassing ‘all learning activities 
undertaken throughout life for the development 
of competencies and qualifications’. This 
recommendation, in force for most of the period 
since 2000, has widened the focus of skill 
development. Independent of the EFA movement, 
it calls on countries to ‘formulate, apply and 
review national human resources development, 
education, training and lifelong learning policies 
which are consistent with economic, fiscal and 
social policies.’

Yet another reason for the greater attention to 
skills since Dakar is that the very definition of 
skills has widened beyond those concerned with 
livelihood. In 2012, a new and much broader 
understanding of skill objectives emerged from 
the Third International Congress on Technical and 
Vocational Education and Training in Shanghai, 
China, leading to a declaration, the Shanghai 
Consensus (UNESCO, 2012d), and consultation 
for new UN recommendations on TVET and adult 
education (King, 2013).

Most advocates today see skill training not as 
separate from but as an integral part of general 
education, offering foundation and transferable 
skills at the same time as job and life skills (Tikly, 
2013). The discourse has thus shifted beyond 
the exclusive focus on economic production that 
historically supported TVET (Anderson, 2009). 
A future foundation for TVET may emerge from 
a new approach and perspective where the 
goal of TVET is work experience that not only 
generates income but also is meaningful and 
enhances workers’ capacity for future growth 
(McGrath, 2012).

With the increased attention to TVET, as well 
as clearer understanding and definitions of the 
skills involved, it is surprising that systematic 
data for monitoring and evaluating effective TVET 
programmes are lacking. International calls 
have been made to expand data collection in this 
area, such as the ILO’s 2004 recommendation 
calling on countries to collect TVET-related 
information, and the Shanghai Consensus, which 

The goal of 
TVET is work 
that not only 
generates 
income 
but also is 
meaningful 
and enhances 
workers’ 
capacity for 
future growth

127

GOAL 3: YOUTH AND ADULT SKILLSTechnical and vocational skills: Approaches are evolvingcalls for ‘frameworks and instruments to improve 
collection of quantitative and qualitative evidence 
relevant to the formulation of the national policy 
agenda … and its monitoring and evaluation’ 
(UNESCO, 2012d).

Despite this, rigorous evidence to inform TVET 
policy has been scarce, and monitoring and 
evaluation have been given low priority at the 
national level (Veal, 2013). In the largest meta-
analysis of TVET programmes ever attempted 
(Tripney et al., 2013), over 8,000 research reports 
were screened on the effect of different models 
of TVET interventions on employment and 
employability outcomes in low and middle income 
countries. But very few of these studies (only 
26 out of the 8,000) had the necessary rigour to 
evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. 
Furthermore, the programmes reviewed in the 
few rigorous studies found effect sizes that 
were ‘small, or even negligible’. Comprehensive 
regional reviews in Latin America also found 
little information available on measuring skill 
development in marginalized populations or on 
assessment of the outputs and impact of relevant 
policies and programmes (Jacinto, 2012, 2010).

These findings set a challenging agenda on 
technical and vocational skills to be addressed 
post-2015. If vocational curricula do not confer 
essential skills today, such a finding would be 
consistent with a large body of sociological and 
education policy research that finds a trade-off 
between the efficacy of job matching and equality 
of opportunity (Bol and Werfhorst, 2013). In 
other words, it is not clear whether vocational 
programmes provide skills to workers who are 
then allocated to a fixed number of positions, 
or whether the programmes truly increase the 
stock of capabilities in the economy, so that new 
jobs are created.

Continuing and  
adult education:  
Four contrasting cases

Skills being taught in formal education do not meet 
the expectations of the actual working world. It is 
heartbreaking to see someone who has expertise in 
a field working in something far from their skills. 

– Audry Maulana (20), Student, Indonesia

Goal 3 commits societies to equitable skill 
development for adults who are beyond the age of 
formal schooling. It is therefore important to ask 
who has access to continuing and adult education. 
Answering this question requires survey data that 
so far exist only in few cases.

From the OECD Programme for the International 
Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC) data, 
it is possible to confirm the findings of previous 
investigations on this question (Badescu et al., 
2013). New research commissioned for this GMR 
finds that, in nearly every country participating 
in PIAAC, the odds of receiving some type of 
adult education within the previous 12 months 
are much lower for adults who did not complete 
secondary school than for adults with secondary 
education (Figure 3.10) (Desjardins, 2015). For 
example, Cypriots with secondary education were 
nearly 3 times as likely to have obtained adult 
education than were those without secondary; 
Norwegians were about 1.5 times more likely.

This is at least partly because adult education 
tends to be offered by firms to employed, rather 
than to unemployed or underemployed, adults. 
Further analysis shows that women are less 
likely to have received adult education than 
men. The odds of receiving adult education 
were also far higher for adults whose parents 
had attained higher levels of formal schooling. 
Targeted government support may be able to 
reach the adults most in need, but only if funds 
are earmarked and complemented with outreach 
activities. Unless support is carefully designed, 
adult education opportunities tend be taken 
up by adults who have already benefited from 
formal schooling.

Many governments seek to correct for market 
failures and to level social inequality through 
supporting public and private employer 
programmes. As with opportunities for technical 
and vocational skills, employers and other diverse 
providers of continuing and adult education do 
not report participant numbers or outcomes. It 
is nevertheless useful to highlight the diverse 
experiences of four countries in recent years 
trying to address equality of opportunity in adult 
education (Desjardins, 2015).

Brazil’s Education of Youth and Adults (EJA) skill 
programme is aimed at people aged 15 and 
older who did not complete formal education.

or working-class families. EJA has increased 
its presence in remote and needy areas of the 
country, though it is far from able to meet the 
needs of all. However, the quality of education 
obtained via EJA is deficient and dropout rates are 
high, making it difficult for adults to expand their 
educational opportunities and mobility. Despite 
being integrated into the overall education 
system, EJA remains in practice a weak pathway 
back to formal education.

In the 1990s, Norway strengthened its already 
strong adult education system with reforms 
that boosted the level and distribution of adult 
education. In 2006, the government promoted 
a major initiative that channelled funds to 
employers for courses for employees with low 
levels of general skills in literacy, numeracy, 
ICT and oral communication. After a major 
increase in funds, from NOK 14 million to 

NOK 105 million, the initiative reached nearly 
700 firms. The country’s adult education system is 
diverse: in addition to the work-focused initiative, 
programmes outside the formal system include 
‘folk’ high schools, education associations, 
language training centres for immigrants, and 
distance education. The focus is not just on skills 
used in the workplace but also includes culture, 
family and personal development. Key skills 
useful for the economy, such as non-routine 
cognition and non-routine communication, are 
not distinguished from similar skills used in 
civil society.

In 2007, the Republic of Korea revised the 
coordination, development and implementation 
of its adult education system, including its 
National Institute for Lifelong Education, Regional 
Institutes for Lifelong Education and Local 
Lifelong Learning Centres. Many activities were 
redesigned to mobilize stakeholders, such as a 
campaign to select and develop lifelong learning 
cities (Republic of Korea Ministry of Education, 
Science and Technology MEST, 2013). National 
data reveal steadily increasing participation

more likely to have obtained adult education than were those without secondary. The results are based on logistical regressions using PIAAC data and control for the effects of age, gender, literacy proficiency 
and parents’ educational attainment.

GOAL 3: YOUTH AND ADULT SKILLSContinuing and adult education: Four contrasting casesrates, from about 26% in 2008 to about 36% 
in 2012. The government created four initiatives to 
promote job-related skills for employees of small 
and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs):

 ■ The SME Training Consortium Programme, 

introduced in 2003, was renamed the 
Consortium for HRD Ability Magnified 
Programme (CHAMP) in 2012. As of 2013, 
159 training consortiums (CHAMP, 2014) 
were receiving subsidies for facilities and 
personnel, covering over 271,000 employees 
and nearly 115,000 SMEs (Republic 
of Korea Ministry of Employment and 
Labor MOEL, 2013).

 ■ The government subsidized advanced training 

programmes. Employees who qualify are 
trained free of charge at vocational training 
institutions with state-of-the-art facilities and 
equipment, and their employers receive part 
of their labour costs. Participation doubled 
from 2006 to 2012.

 ■ Since 2006, the government has 

subsidized organized study within SMEs. 
Support is available for up to three years, 
depending on results.

 ■ The government provides subsidies for self-
directed learning through its Job Upgrading 
and Maturing Programme for SME employees 
and non-regular workers.

In Viet Nam, a 2005 amendment to the national 
education law made non-formal adult education 
and adult literacy training a major component 
of the overall education system. This measure 
included provisions for skill advancement in the 
workplace, second-chance opportunities linked to 
the formal education system, and the development 
of people as citizens and essential participants 
in communities. Programmes are now diverse 
and aspire to serve many different needs of the 
population, for example through programmes 
that focus on HIV prevention, peace and human 
rights, gender, health care for mothers and 
children, prevention of drug use, nutrition, and the 
environment. Participation rates in adult education 
have risen in recent years: there were almost 10 
million participants in adult learning and non-
formal education programmes in 2008, compared 
with just over half a million in 1999. Community 
Learning Centres are the most important platform 

for access to adult education opportunities; there 
were nearly 10,000 centres in 2010. They play 
a critical role in connecting organizations and 
communities, and coordinate formerly separate 
programmes. By bringing together individuals 
and agencies from various sectors in addition to 
education, Viet Nam’s programmes greatly expand 
the scope of educational activities in those sectors.

Direct measures of hard and 
soft skills are emerging in 
many countries

Much of this chapter focused on pathways to 
skill acquisition. This is partly because direct 
measures of skills are still under development. 
However, direct measures of cognitive (‘hard’) and 
socio-emotional (‘soft’) skills are being advanced. 
New types of measurement, along with attention 
to a broader definition of ‘skills’ than in the past, 
will be increasingly important after 2015. Experts 
including Nobel laureate James Heckman 
(Heckman and Kautz, 2012) have shown that 
socio-emotional skills are not immutable but can 
be learned through positive school experiences 
and may be as important as cognitive skills in 
obtaining good employment.

Two examples of current direct measures of hard 
and soft skills are the OECD’s Programme for the 
International Assessment of Adult Competencies 
(PIAAC), conducted from 2008 to 2013, and the 
World Bank’s ongoing Skills Toward Employment 
and Productivity study (STEP). Their results can 
and should be used to answer key questions 
about how different types of education relate to 
what kinds of skills and learning, and how these 
skills contribute to an individual’s employment 
opportunities and civic engagement.

PIACC

PIAAC offers direct measures of learning and 
skills acquisition that are considered important 
for progress towards goal 3. The PIAAC survey 
interviewed representative national samples 
of adults, aged 16 to 65, assessing literacy and 
numeracy skills and the ability to solve problems 
in technology-rich environments. It also collected 
information about how skills were used at work, 
in the home and in the community.

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 31025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportMeasures of adult competencies, through PIACC, 
support the idea that learning takes place over the 
life course and not only during childhood or within 
schools. National differences in skill levels among 
young adults relate only loosely to the national 
skill levels of 15-year-old students 10 years 
earlier as evidenced by the OECD’s Programme 
for International Student Assessment (PISA). 
Most cross-national differences in adult literacy 
and numeracy are not accounted for by national 
differences in student proficiencies (OECD, 2013c). 
One interpretation of the low association between 
national averages of PISA and PIAAC is that skills 
can be learned after individuals leave school, and 
can be lost if the skills are not used regularly. 
The workplace is an important context for skill 
acquisition and retention. 

Findings from PIAAC also show that curricular 
focus can impact skill acquisition: there are 
clear differences in numeracy and literacy scores 
between adults who had previously studied in 
vocational programmes and general education, 
whose last completed level of schooling was 
upper secondary.4 In the United States, for 
example, older cohorts with vocational training 
had greater numeracy skills than did adults 
having general education. However, for younger 
people there was no such advantage. On the 

other hand, in Estonia, Germany, the Netherlands, 
Poland and the Republic of Korea, differences 
were wider in recent cohorts (ages 16 to 29) than 
in older ones (ages 30 to 65) (Figure 3.11). In 
such settings, the evidence suggests that skill 
acquisition in vocational programmes is more 
limited than in general programmes, and this 
negative effect has become more salient among 
younger cohorts.5

Measures 
of adult 
competencies 
support the 
idea that 
learning 
takes place 
throughout life

Certainly the observed skill gap between those 
who completed general education vs vocational 
programmes, and whether it has widened in 
recent years, deserves further scrutiny and 
longitudinal research. Of greater significance 
is identifying other settings and learning 
frameworks – for example, distance and open 
education, non-formal education, on-the-
job training and adult education – that may 
significantly augment skill acquisition among 
adults over the life course.

STEP

The World Bank’s STEP study is another strategy 
to measure, and potentially match, the skill 
sets of individuals and companies in the same 
area. It is based on samples of households and 
enterprises in mainly urban areas of middle

4. A recent PISA assessment found that low achievers and students from 
lower socio-economic backgrounds were more likely to enrol (or be 
channeled) into vocational programmes, and that their tested skill levels 
are lower  (Altinok, 2012). The preponderance of weaker, male and less 
advantaged students in such programmes would provide a clear explanation 
of the difference in PIACC scores. However, in 19 of the 22 countries studied, 
the negative impact of vocation education on skill acquisition remained, even 
after controlling for gender, socio-economic status and motivation.

5. This finding, if corroborated, would supplement research that raises doubts 
about the effectiveness of vocational programmes for skill acquisition, as 
well as post-secondary attainment and earnings (Ayalon and Shavit, 2004; 
Carbonaro, 2005; Plank et al., 2008). It would also add to policy-oriented 
research that finds a trade-off between the efficacy of job matching in the 
short term and greater inequality of opportunity in the long term (Bol and 
Werfhorst, 2013).

GOAL 3: YOUTH AND ADULT SKILLSDirect measures of hard and soft skills are emerging in many countriesBox 3.3: Effects of soft skills, formal 
education, and technical skills on earnings 
in Colombia, Ghana and Sri Lanka

Economists have always known that school years are 
just a crude indicator of the abilities that come from 
education. In STEP, the World Bank created indicators 
for the soft skill of openness and for the technical 
skills associated with computer use. ‘Openness’ was 
measured by responses to three questions often used 
by psychologists in personality tests. Computing skill 
was indicated by self-reported frequency of computer 
use on the job and off. Analyses of STEP surveys show 
that all three indicators affect the earnings of workers in 
Colombia, Ghana and Sri Lanka (Figure 3.12).

schooling but also by soft skills and technical skills

income countries. STEP was conducted in a 
first wave of eight countries in 2012 (Bolivia, 
China’s Yunnan province, Colombia, Ghana, 
the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Sri Lanka, 
Ukraine and Viet Nam) and a second wave of 
five countries in 2013 (Armenia, Azerbaijan, 
Georgia, Kenya and the former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia). In general, the STEP surveys 
reveal the adult skills used and rewarded in early 
employment, and the skills associated with TVET 
curricula and other training.

STEP measured three areas: reading proficiency 
(which is discussed in more detail in Chapter 
4); self-reported information on personality, 
behaviour, and time and risk preferences; and 
task-specific skills that the respondent possessed 
or used both in and outside of work, including 
numeracy and computer use. 

One of STEP’s innovations was to develop 
measurements for soft skills such as social 
adjustment, openness to learning, confidence and 
sense of security.6 STEP attempted to create a 
cross-culturally valid set of indicators for non-
cognitive socio-emotional skills that matter for 
other outcomes. After extensive pilot testing, 
the survey included a self-report of personality 
traits and behaviour that were transferable and 
could be considered non-cognitive or soft skills. 
STEP confirmed the value of soft skills in general, 
and more specifically found that ‘openness’ 
has positive effects on earnings, even when the 
positive effect of years of education is taken into 
account. ICT skills, measured by frequency of 
computer use, were shown to have a similar 
positive effect (Box 3.3).

6. This builds on earlier research on ‘individual modernization’ and 
orientations such as ‘openness to new experience’ which are related to 
education (Inkeles and Smith, 1974).

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 31025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportAdvocates for lifelong learning and leaders of 
basic education should help each other specify 
which skills will be monitored with future 
instruments, and collaborate on the frameworks 
which will establish standards and guide their 
promotion and monitoring. Although goal 3 was 
criticized as being out of step with the UN norms 
guiding adult education and TVET, standard-
setting frameworks now being developed will 
define the aims and programmes to be monitored 
after 2015. At the same time, UNESCO has led 
the articulation of skills that are foundational for 
global citizenship and sustainability. Advocates 
of basic education and lifelong learning are 
integrating global citizenship and sustainability 
into a broad skill framework.

One conclusion from the GMR’s monitoring of 
goal 3 is that better coordination and cooperation 
are needed among stakeholders: ministries, 
civil society organizations, advocates of lifelong 
learning and schooling, enterprises and 
providers of education and training, whether 
or not they are based in schools. In line with 
ILO Recommendation 195 and the Shanghai 
Consensus, greater information on skill provision 
outside school, and its outcomes, will make future 
monitoring possible for this essential dimension 
of education.

Conclusions

The progress towards universal primary education 
since Dakar, discussed in the previous chapter, 
has made the need for equitable opportunities 
for secondary education and post-primary 
skills even more urgent. Although there has 
been major progress in expanding access to 
the lower secondary and even upper secondary 
levels, inequality in terms of income and location 
persists. Working children, while increasingly 
included in school, often must continue to 
work, and their academic success is likely to be 
harmed. Migrant children are at risk of being 
further marginalized unless countries take steps 
to integrate them.

Monitoring skills will be easier in the future 
because of the emergence of direct assessments 
of adults’ non-cognitive and cognitive skills. Direct 
assessments can also be helpful in gauging 
changes in orientations that facilitate learning, 
such as ‘openness’, an indicator measured by 
STEP. These outcomes now go beyond foundation 
skills and include other skills important for work 
and citizenship. 

Assessments of knowledge in specific areas, such 
as HIV and AIDS, have indicated positive change 
since Dakar. Apart from knowledge, assessments 
of attitudes or values show change in some areas, 
including with regard to women’s educational 
opportunities. These assessments have emerged 
at the same time that the concept of ‘skills’ has 
been broadened beyond livelihood skills to include 
those needed for citizenship and, perhaps in the 
future, for sustainable development.

Goal 4: Adult literacy

135

Highlights ■There are about 781 million illiterate adults. The rate of illiteracy is likely to have dropped slightly from 18% in 2000 to 14% in 2015, which means that the Dakar target of halving illiteracy has not been achieved. ■Only 17 out of 73 countries with a literacy rate below 95% in 2000 halved their illiteracy rate by 2015. ■Progress has been made towards gender parity in literacy. All countries where fewer than 90 women for every 100 men were literate in 2000 have moved towards parity, but none of them will reach parity by 2015. ■Progress in adult literacy rates may be the consequence of younger, better educated people replacing older, less educated ones and not due to the implementation of effective literacy programmes. ■Since 2000, there have been major innovations in the assessment of literacy skills which are aligned with a concept of literacy as a continuum. More needs to be done to extend the use of such assessment tools around the world. ■While changes in daily life such as mobile technology may increase demand for the acquisition of literacy skills, their impact on literacy outcomes has not yet been shown.1025Adult literacy .................................137

Literacy is fundamental for 
participating in society. However, the 
goal of halving global illiteracy rates 
by 2015 has been missed. While 
progress has been made, some 
positive trends were not the result of 
concerted programmatic efforts but 
instead more schooled populations 
entering adulthood. This chapter 
explores factors that help explain 
limited progress in adult literacy. 
It describes how assessments 
of literacy are improving and 
expanding, and recommends more 
sophisticated targets and strong 
support for adult literacy strategies 
and literate environments. 

Literacy is more than the personal ability to read and write. It is a powerful 
vehicle to empower people and help them obtain the adequate life skills and 
entrepreneurship capacities to tackle contemporary challenges and optimize 
opportunities for sustainable development. It is for this reason that our 
government made investing in literacy a priority through the successful 
National Literacy Campaign Programme.“

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALL1025Education for All Global Monitoring Report  Goal 4    Adult literacy

Achieving a 50 per cent improvement in levels of adult literacy by 2015, especially 
for women, and equitable access to basic and continuing education for all adults.

Since 2000, progress towards EFA’s fourth 
goal has been slower than improvements in 
other goals, including in primary school access 
and completion. This slow progress leads to 
three important questions: How pervasive is 
the phenomenon of low literacy skills among 
adults today? Why does it persist? And what are 
countries and international agencies doing to 
monitor and improve literacy? Addressing these 
questions is the purpose of this chapter.

As the introduction to this Education for All 
(EFA) Global Monitoring Report (GMR) underlines, 
nearly 781 million adults are deficient in 
literacy skills. Judging from recent direct 
assessments of adults’ reading ability, a more 
accurate estimate would be considerably higher. 
This chapter shows that since 2000, few low-
literacy countries have reduced the illiteracy 
rate by 50%.1

It is a concern that the adult literacy goal 
has not been met, because the benefits of 
literacy and numeracy go beyond individuals. 
While UNESCO’s 1950s definition of ‘literacy’ 
was merely an ability to ‘read and write, with 
understanding, a short, simple statement 
about everyday life’, by 1990 literacy was 
more recognized as a skill that contributes to 
individual well-being. More recently, UNESCO 
(2005a) considered literacy as the ability 
to ‘identify, understand, interpret, create, 
communicate and compute using printed 
and written materials’ associated with varied 
contexts. Today, literacy is seen as a continuum 
of skills that enables individuals to achieve their 
goals in work and life and participate fully in 
society, a point confirmed by the international 
community in the 2009 Belém Framework for 
Action (UIL, 2010). The spread of literacy and 
literate environments also develops a web 
of active social relations and contributes to 
communities and social institutions  
(Benavot, forthcoming).

This chapter assesses country progress towards 
the adult literacy targets drawing first upon 

1. Since 2006, the GMR has interpreted the goal as implying 50% reduction in 
illiteracy rates.

indirect assessments of literacy skills. It then 
elaborates how countries are increasingly 
conducting direct assessments of literacy, which 
are both more accurate and context-specific.

However, the chapter also shows that most of 
the reductions in adult illiteracy rates reflect 
the entry of younger, more educated, cohorts 
into adulthood, rather than improvement within 
cohorts of adults who were past school age. 
Accordingly, it focuses on four factors that could 
have enabled improvement of adult literacy since 
2000, but have not had major impact: global 
commitment to adult literacy, literacy campaigns 
and programmes, policies on multilingualism, 
and demand for literacy through environments 
requiring better skills.

Most countries are still  
far from goal 4

The Mobilization and recruitment of learners 
through awareness campaigns is crucial for the 
success of all large-scale literacy programs. Most 
of Nepal’s literacy graduates encouraged others to 
participate in literacy classes.

– Vishnu Karki 
Room to Read, Nepal

Monitoring adult literacy requires consistent 
information to allow comparisons. But obtaining 
such information can be sometimes challenging 
because definitions of literacy have evolved since 
2000 (Box 4.1). Focusing on countries with a 
literacy rate below 95% in the 1995–2004 period 
and where information was consistently based 
on self-declarations, only 17 out of 73 countries 
are projected to at least halve their adult 
illiteracy rate by 2015 (Figure 4.1).

The lowest rate of illiteracy decline was 1% 
in Guinea; the highest was 83% in Kuwait. In 
general, wealthier countries experienced the 
fastest declines in illiteracy, such as China, 
Saudi Arabia and Singapore. By contrast, mainly 
poor countries, such as Cambodia, Chad and 
Mozambique, continued to be furthest from 
achieving the target.

Today, literacy 
is seen as a 
continuum 
of skills that 
enables  
individuals  
to achieve  
their goals in 
work and life

GOAL 4: ADULT LITERACYMost countries are still far from goal 4Box 4.1 Consistent definitions of literacy are

circa 2000 and 2015 

Countries and policy-makers recognize the need for 
better and more nuanced information on literacy than 
what currently exists. However, changes to definitions can 
hamper global assessment of progress over time.

Until recently, almost all estimates reported by the UIS were 
based on declarations by the household head or other 
household members on whether they could read or write, 
with some countries presuming literacy for those who had 
completed primary school. In recent years, in the absence 
of up-to-date traditional sources, the UIS has been obliged 
to use sources that rely on direct assessment. Changes in 
measurement methods are recorded, but the implications 
of these changes are not always well understood. 

However, the problems with comparison over time go 
beyond a lack of comparable data sources. Another 
problem is that national definitions of literacy have even 
changed in countries where literacy rates are based on 
the same sources and methods. Malaysia used school 
attendance to define literacy in 2010 but not in previous 
years. At the time of the Dakar Framework, China defined 
literacy differently in rural and urban areas; its definitions 
were made consistent only in the 2010 census. Country 
definitions can also even change over a short period. 
In 2007, to be ‘literate’ in the Bolivarian Republic of 
Venezuela meant being able to read and write at least a 
paragraph in any language, but in 2009 it meant only that 
survey respondents said they could read and write.

Source: UIS (2014b).

The Dakar Framework made explicit reference 
for the goal to be reached ‘especially 
for women’. The record is mixed. Of the 
73 countries compared above, the projected 
change by 2015 is faster for females than for 
the average population.

Undoubtedly, there has been progress. 
All countries where fewer than 90 women for 
every 100 men were literate in or around 2000, 
have moved towards parity. For example, in 
Timor-Leste, for every 100 literate men, there 
were only 66 literate women in 2001 but 83 in 
2010; the ratio is projected to increase to 89 by 
2015 (Figure 4.2). Global improvement since 
2000 appears to extend a move towards gender 
parity that began earlier, judging from countries 
such as Bangladesh, Burundi, Chad and Yemen, 
which also made substantial progress between 
1990 and 2000. But none of these countries will 
have reached parity by 2015.

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 41025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportInternational and national 
surveys facilitate direct 
assessment of literacy

The problems with measuring literacy from self-
declarations or declarations on behalf of others 
have led to efforts to conduct direct literacy 
assessments through household surveys.  
Despite additional insights from this approach, 
most standard household surveys that assess 
literacy skills directly are based on a simple 
binary division between literacy and illiteracy. 

Since Dakar, however, literacy has increasingly 
been seen not as a single but as a plural 
concept; as an action by actors who are 
differently placed in various social, cultural, 
political, economic and historical contexts, and 
who each have different purposes in reading 
and writing various types of texts. Literacy takes 
different shapes as a continuum of skills used 
for communication. Literacy researchers today 
ask how people use their literacy, what use it has 
in their lives, and what implications it carries for 

their interpersonal relationships (Bartlett, 2008; 
Prins, 2009; Street, 2003).

Countries and international agencies have 
therefore begun to conduct more sophisticated 
investigations to gauge not only whether adults 
are ‘literate’ or ‘illiterate’ but also their level of 
literacy and the consequences for individuals 
and societies (Ahmed, 2011; Esposito et al., 
2014; Guadalupe and Cardoso, 2011).

DHS and MICS

Since 2000, the two main international household 
survey programmes, the Demographic and 
Health Survey (DHS) and the Multiple Indicator 
Cluster Survey (MICS), have attempted to assess 
literacy directly by asking household respondents 
to read a sentence from a card. Adults who had 
continued to secondary school were not given 
this test because they were presumed literate. 
Despite the limitations of this simple technique, 
used in a survey designed for a different 
purpose, the resulting measurements are more 
accurate than self-declarations and have made a

GOAL 4: ADULT LITERACYInternational and national surveys facilitate direct assessment of literacyBased 
on direct 
assessment, 
the world 
is even 
further from 
universal 
adult literacy 
than official 
estimates 
suggest

considerable contribution to our understanding of 
literacy levels.

In recent years, the UIS has selectively used 
the information from these surveys when no 
other recent traditional source of information on 
literacy based on self-assessment was available. 
This switch in source allows a comparison 
between earlier projections based on self-
assessment and the latest projections based 
on direct assessment for 20 countries, mostly 
sub-Saharan African (Figure 4.3). Substantial 
differences between the two are often apparent. 
When estimates are based on direct assessment, 
even more adults appear to be deficient in 
reading skills than when estimates are derived 
from self-declarations. The average difference 
for these 20 countries is about eight percentage 
points, which means that the world is even 
further from universal adult literacy than official 
estimates suggest.

PIAAC

The OECD developed the Programme for the 
International Assessment of Adult Competencies 
(PIAAC), a study in 25 highly literate societies 
that sampled 166,000 persons aged 16 to 65. It 
extends the literacy domains originally covered 
in the International Adult Literacy Survey of 

the 1990s, and builds on the Adult Literacy 
and Life Skills Survey administered in the 
period 2003–2007 in 13 countries with highly 
literate populations.

As with its predecessors, the scaled levels 
and scores of PIAAC can be compared across 
countries, education attainment levels and types 
of employment. This direct assessment shows 
that, even in high income countries, a notable 
minority of adults have only very low levels of 
proficiency in reading (OECD, 2013c).

PIAAC defines six levels of proficiency: level 1, 
and levels 1 through 5. Individuals proficient at 
level 1 can read brief texts on familiar topics 
and ‘locate a single piece of information that is 
identical to or synonymous with the information 
given in the question or directive’ (OECD, 
2013c). Around 3% of adults read below level 
1 in PIAAC participant countries and a further 
12% read at level 1 but no higher. The results 
imply that about as many as one in seven adults 
either never became proficient readers while 
they were in school, or their reading abilities 
atrophied because they were not being used. In 
countries such as France, Italy and Spain, more 
than one in four adults had low literacy skills 
(OECD, 2013c).

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 41025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportInternational differences in adult literacy are 
not only related to differences in education 
attainment. Adults continue to learn and adapt 
to the needs of their occupations. Not only do 
more literate adults work in jobs that demand 
literacy skills, but skilled occupations also help 
develop reading proficiency. In such occupations, 
the reading environment is more conducive to 
retaining literacy skills than in jobs requiring 
little reading. The results of PIAAC show wide 
gaps within countries between the reading 
abilities of workers in different occupations, with 
adults in occupations classified by the OECD as 
‘skilled’ scoring much higher in literacy than 
those in elementary occupations. These gaps are 
wider in some OECD countries than in others. 
For example, the reading score gap between the 
two occupation types was almost twice as high in 
Norway as it was in Slovakia (Figure 4.4). 

STEP

The World Bank launched the Skills towards 
Employment and Productivity (STEP) surveys 
of adult skills, including literacy, in 13 middle 
income countries in 2010 (World Bank, 
2014g). The study uses the same definition 
of literacy and the same six levels of literacy 
proficiency as PIAAC. 

STEP surveys have been carried out among 
populations possessing relatively lower literacy 
skills, despite the fact that in most cases only 
urban areas have been sampled. For that 
reason, respondents were first screened using 
eight questions to determine whether a full 
assessment was possible.

Among countries where data have been 
released, the lowest rate of passing the initial 
screen was in urban Ghana, where about 66% 
of men and 38% of women in urban areas went 
on to take the full assessment in English. By 
contrast, in Sri Lanka, where the assessment 
was administered in either Sinhalese or Tamil, 
the percentage of respondents passing the 
initial screen was far higher, 81%, with no 
gender disparity.

This large gap goes beyond what we know 
already regarding differences in schooling 
attainment and self-reported literacy skills 
between the two countries. For example, 

Skilled 
occupations 
also help 
develop 
reading 
proficiency

according to UIS data, the adult literacy rate in 
2010 was 71% in Ghana and 91% in Sri Lanka. 
This is not surprising given that in 2010, 30% of 
the adult population in Ghana had no schooling 
compared with only 4% in Sri Lanka (Barro and 
Lee, 2013). The gap revealed by STEP may also 
reflect, at least partly, differences in the quality 
of schooling. However, the assessment in Ghana 
was administered in English, the home language 
of less than 2% of sampled adults. Among the 
small number who used English, 90% passed 
the initial screening. In Sri Lanka, the vast 
majority of adults had the opportunity to take the 
assessment in their mother tongue.

In the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Colombia, 
Ghana and Viet Nam, the surveys showed clear 
relationships between reading proficiency 
and the amount of reading required by the 
respondents’ occupation, as in PIAAC countries 
(Figure 4.5). Adults whose jobs demanded more 
reading had higher proficiency levels. The scores 
for urban workers in reading-intensive jobs 
in Viet Nam were similar to scores in France, 
Italy and Spain.

GOAL 4: ADULT LITERACYInternational and national surveys facilitate direct assessment of literacyLAMP

The UIS initiated the Literacy Assessment and 
Monitoring Programme (LAMP) to highlight the 
multiple dimensions of literacy as measured 
in prose reading, document reading and 
numeracy (UIS, 2009).

LAMP sampled adults from both rural and 
urban areas in Jordan, Mongolia, Palestine and 
Paraguay. Its complexity, along with changes in UIS 
administration, delayed LAMP’s development and 
any release of official reports or data (Guadalupe, 
2014). This may be why some countries initially 
willing to participate found alternative approaches. 
For example, Kenya developed its own literacy 
survey, while Viet Nam joined STEP.

LAMP defined three levels of literacy attainment. 
Results from Paraguay show that adults in 
rural areas have lower prose reading skills than 
urban dwellers, although there was no such 
gap between rural and urban areas in terms 
of numeracy skills (Figure 4.6). Only 9% of 
rural adults achieved the highest level in prose 
reading skills (level 3) compared with 20% of 
urban adults. A possible reason for the gap is 
that fewer rural than urban residents identify 
Spanish as a mother tongue (Zarza et al., 2014). 

National adult literacy assessments

Many lower literacy countries began to use 
literacy assessments in the 1980s. Some included 
them in larger household surveys, a cost-effective 
strategy with many advantages (Venkatraman, 
2008). Others used surveys specifically focused on 
adult literacy. The Kenya National Adult Literacy 
Survey of 2006, administered in 18 local languages 
in addition to English and Kiswahili, found wide 
urban–rural differences and adult national 
literacy rates of 59% for women and 64% for men 
(UNESCO, 2008b). The estimate for women was 
13 points below the rate that UIS estimated based 
on self-declarations of ability to read, while the 
estimate for men was 15 points lower.

Since 2008, the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics 
has drawn a random national sample of 
households to test for levels of literacy and 
numeracy. The second national literacy survey, 
conducted in 2011 in several languages, 
defined four levels of literacy and estimated the 
distribution of males and females aged 11 to 45 
by each level. These estimates give a different 
picture of literacy than what is seen through 
self- or proxy-declaration estimates. In 2011, the 
census declaration method led to adult literacy 
rate estimates of 64% for men and 58% for

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 41025Education for All Global Monitoring Reportwomen in this age group (Bangladesh Bureau 
of Statistics, 2013). But the literacy survey of 
the same year, a direct assessment, showed 
that only 57% of men and 50% of women were 
functionally literate (Table 4.1). 

One advantage of national assessments is 
increasing the numbers of national stakeholders 
and experts dedicated to adult literacy. One 
disadvantage is that external monitoring may 
become more difficult because national agencies 
have a conflict of interest, being responsible 
for monitoring literacy and reducing illiteracy 
rates at the same time. This dual role can create 
pressure to show progress or to restrict access 
to data by independent assessors.

Comparing cohorts shows 
almost no real gains in adult 
literacy since 2000

Since 2000, there have been considerable 
improvements in the approaches taken to assess 
literacy skills in adult populations. Although these 
methods have not yet been widely enough adopted 
to give a global picture, evidence suggests that 
traditional measures of literacy have been narrow 
in scope and have not captured the extent to 
which adults possess skills that allow them to 
participate fully in society. 

However, there is another major gap in our 
knowledge. Literacy programmes are premised 
on the notion that adults can improve their 
literacy skills. Unfortunately, the utility of the 
adult literacy rate for assessing the success of 
literacy programmes is hampered by the fact 
that this indicator is based on a different adult 

population at different points in time. As a result, 
even if not a single adult changes their literacy 
status, the adult literacy rate may increase or 
decline, purely through composition effects. The 
most obvious case is that of cohort replacement: 
young individuals with higher education 
attainment and literacy skills cross into the adult 
age bracket, while older individuals with lower 
education attainment and literacy skills depart. 
This could lead to an improvement in the adult 
literacy rate that is real, but achieved without a 
single illiterate adult becoming literate at the 
individual level.

As a result, the trajectory of adult literacy may 
differ substantially depending on whether we 
look, for example, at a group of people aged 
20–30 years in 2000 and 2010 or a group of 
people aged 20–30 years in 2000 and 30–40 years 
in 2010. Any change we observe in the latter case 
will not be due to changing schooling but literacy 
skill acquisition through literacy programmes 
or other opportunities in life. Analysing literacy 
trends using this latter cohort approach provides 
an important complementary perspective to 
understand changes in adult literacy and their 
possible causes. Yet such a perspective has 
been rarely applied outside of studies of lifelong 
learning in industrialized countries.

New analysis for this GMR has followed precisely 
this latter approach. Ideally, this would involve 
monitoring the literacy skills of a particular 
group of individuals over time. However, such 
studies are extremely rare. What is possible 
instead is to use DHS data and follow the literacy 
status of a given birth cohort as it ages. Two 
to three waves of DHS from 30 countries were 
used (Barakat, 2015a). The analysis focused on 
the female samples of these surveys, which are 
larger and therefore more robust.

GOAL 4: ADULT LITERACYComparing cohorts shows almost no real gains in adult literacy since 2000The central result is that most countries are on a 
trajectory of slow but definite improvement in the 
literacy rates of young female adults over time 
(Figure 4.7; dashed lines); but these apparent 
gains disappear from a cohort perspective 
(Figure 4.7; continuous thick lines). For example, 
in Malawi the literacy rate of women aged 
20–34 years was 49% in 2000 and 63% in 2010. 
However, the literacy rate of the cohort of women 
who were aged 20–34 years in 2000 and 30–44 
years in 2010 remained constant at 49%. In 
Ethiopia, the literacy rate of the cohort of women 
who were aged 20–34 years in 2000 had fallen 
from 21% to 16% eleven years later when these 
women were aged 31–45 years. 

While the results for only a few countries 
are shown, they are representative of the 
30 countries included in the analysis. In most

follows women aged 20–34 in 2000 who were aged 30–44 by 2010. The dashed line follows the same 
age group; for example, the dashed line in Malawi follows women aged 20–34 in 2000 and 2010.

countries, literacy among a particular cohort 
stagnated or even declined over time as skills 
were underutilized. This does not contradict 
the increase in overall adult literacy. However, 
this increase is driven almost entirely by the 
replacement of older women with low literacy 
skills by younger women with higher literacy 
skills that enter into the age group. The results 
hold true even if taking into account that 
people with higher literacy skills have a lower 
probability of early death or a higher probability 
of migration. 

Further analysis focusing on subgroups of 
women by education level shows that even the 
limited gains mostly concern women who had at 
least begun primary school. The gains disappear 
among women who never attended school as 
children. In other words, adults who improved 
their literacy are more likely to have had at least 
some formal schooling (Barakat, 2015b).

In the figures above, Nepal is an outlier. Not only 
did it post the most rapid improvement in the 
adult literacy of women aged 20-34 among the 
countries analysed but is also the only country 
where a sustained improvement is confirmed at 
the cohort level over three survey waves. While 
the 2001 survey was restricted to ever-married 
women, the 2006 and 2011 surveys included all 
women in the target population. One reason for 
this positive performance could be the success 
of the government’s investment of US$35 
million in the 2008–2012 National Literacy 
Campaign Programme (Nepal National Planning 
Commission, 2013), which received UNESCO’s 
Confucius Literacy Prize in 2010.

Explaining limited progress  
in adult literacy

If the literacy skills of adults who were above 
school age did not improve in most developing 
countries, then considerable doubt is cast on 
the impact of efforts to improve the literacy 
skills of adult populations since 2000. The 
remainder of the chapter assesses four factors 
that may help explain why progress was not 
achieved. These include the extent of global 
political commitment, the effectiveness of 
literacy campaigns and programmes, the scope 
of attempts to promote mother tongue literacy 

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 41025Education for All Global Monitoring Reportprogrammes, and the influence of demand for 
literacy. While there has not been an assessment 
of their relative importance, evidence since 2000 
suggests that national literacy policies should 
take all four factors into account.

The global commitment to adult literacy 
was ambiguous

World literacy rates grew fastest during the 1970s 
and illiteracy was reduced by more than half from 
1950 to around 2000 (Carr-Hill, 2008). Even from 
1970 to 2000, literacy increased from 28% to 60% 
in sub-Saharan Africa and from 29% to 63% in 
the Arab States (UNESCO, 2006b). Encouraged by 
this progress, the international community has 
repeatedly made declarations to promote adult 
literacy over the past quarter-century. Declared 
targets have raised expectations that illiteracy 
would follow a path like that of polio and could 
be ‘eradicated’. The UNESCO-stimulated Plan 
of Action for the Eradication of Illiteracy by the 
Year 2000 was adopted in 1989. The 1990 World 
Declaration on Education for All in Jomtien 
emphasized that literacy was ‘a necessary skill 
in itself and the foundation of other life skills’. 
The 2000 Dakar Framework for Action also set a 
specific target for improving literacy. 

Unlike the EFA Declaration, however, the 
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 
included no specific reference to adult learning 
or literacy. The implicit assumption was that 
universal primary education of good quality 
would eventually lead to adult literacy. The MDGs 
both reflected and helped shape development 
aims and assistance. Some argue that as a 
consequence, adult literacy has slipped down 
both international and national agendas (Wagner, 
2010). An analysis for this GMR compared 
two national education plans – one drafted 
around 2000 and the other since 2007 – from 
30 countries. It confirmed that adult literacy 
was neglected compared with other EFA goals 
(IIEP, 2015).

What has advanced is thinking about literacy. 
The United Nations declared 2003–2012 as the 
UN Literacy Decade (UNLD). In 2006, UNESCO 
created the Literacy Initiative for Empowerment 
(LIFE) as the global framework for implementing 
the UNLD when it became apparent that 
existing efforts would be insufficient to achieve 
the targets by 2015. The aim was to encourage 

governments, non-government organizations 
(NGOs), the private sector and development 
agencies to revitalize and advance literacy 
efforts. LIFE focused on 35 countries in which 
85% of the world’s non-literate adults resided 
and promoted a broader concept of literacy.  

Another important response to adult illiteracy 
was the Belém Framework for Action, a result 
of UNESCO’s Sixth International Conference on 
Adult Education (CONFINTEA VI) in December 
2009 in Belém, Brazil. The framework was 
consistent with a holistic view of literacy 
(Oxenham, 2008), placing it at the centre of adult 
education and as a point of departure for lifelong 
learning and development goals. It helped 
reframe literacy within the UN system; the UIL 
was asked to lead policy responses (UIL, 2010).

The 2nd Global Report on Adult Learning and 
Education: Rethinking Literacy, known as GRALE2 
(UIL, 2013), showed messages from the Belém 
Framework integrated into national debates 
and policy reform. It offered a comprehensive 
account of national literacy policies and 
progress from analysing 129 submitted national 
progress reports. 

Despite laudable global initiatives to 
reconceptualise adult literacy since 2000 and 
initiate literacy programmes that embrace these 
principles, these programmes were not very 
effective in practice. The midterm evaluation of 
LIFE found that it had been difficult to create a 
common understanding of the initiative. While 
significant changes were initiated in literacy 
programmes, in the context of the CapEFA LIFE 
programmes, these were found to be lacking a 
long-term vision in line with national education 
strategies (UIL, 2012; MDF, 2013).

Literacy campaigns and programmes have 
changed, but their impact is elusive

Governments initiated mass adult literacy 
campaigns in the 1970s and 1980s, in some 
cases following radical social reform. But in the 
1990s, such campaigns became less common 
as a result of an international shift in focus 
to universal primary education (Robinson-
Pant, 2010). This was reinforced by political 
reasons as well as a critique of the way 
campaigns understood how literacy is acquired 
(Boughton, 2010).

GOAL 4: ADULT LITERACYExplaining limited progress in adult literacyNevertheless, interest by regional organisations 
and governments in launching literacy 
campaigns has increased since 2000, especially 
in Latin America (Table 4.2). Most of the 
campaigns set ambitious targets, but the 

deadlines have already passed in some cases 
with targets unmet. Some scholars have argued 
that campaigns had failed almost everywhere 
(Rogers, 2003; Wagner, 2013).

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 41025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportMajor campaigns carry risks. They can raise 
unrealistic expectations. They do not always 
cater to diversity, using a centrally designed 
‘one size fits all’ approach with a prescribed 
curriculum, objectives and materials. Some 
countries have targeted specific populations, 
such as prison inmates in Pakistan, people 
with disabilities in Ecuador, or indigenous 
communities in Nicaragua (Hanemann, 2015). 

The language of campaigns often portrays 
illiteracy as a ‘social illness’ which can be 
‘eradicated’ with the right intervention, as 
found in the Plurinational State of Bolivia and 
in Timor-Leste. This can stigmatize illiteracy, 

demotivate those with low literacy skills and 
lead them to hide their problems, particularly 
if political leaders declare the country to be 
‘illiteracy-free’. 

Monitoring and evaluation systems to assess 
success have been lacking. The inherently 
complex features of adult literacy education, 
which demand strong capacity and coordination 
mechanisms, may have prevented such progress 
(UIL, 2012). One exception is the South Africa 
national literacy campaign (Box 4.2).

Teacher recruitment and training is considered 

Box 4.2 Adult literacy campaigns and programmes often lack research on their effectiveness

Although literacy campaigns set ambitious targets, there 
are often no monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to track 
progress and report results. 

The literacy campaign model Yo Sí Puedo (Yes I Can) was 
developed in 2001 at the Institute of Pedagogy for Latin 
America and the Caribbean, based in Havana. The campaign 
initially provided mass literacy programmes via radio, and 
later through audiovisual programmes delivered via television 
or DVD. Between 2003 and 2013, more than 7 million people 
in 30 countries – mainly in Latin America and the Caribbean 
and sub-Saharan Africa – learned to read and write using 
this literacy model. The three month course is divided into 
three phases: training, teaching of reading and writing, and 
consolidation. In 2004, when the regional alliance known 
as ALBA (formerly Alianza Bolivariana para los Pueblos de 
Nuestra América) was created, it promoted Yo Sí Puedo. 
Three ALBA countries have declared themselves ‘illiteracy-
free’ since – the Plurinational State of Bolivia (2009), Ecuador 
(2009) and Nicaragua (2011). Some governments see Yo Sí 
Puedo as ‘a low-cost method of reaching very large numbers 
of people in a fairly short period of time’. However, despite its 
wide adoption, there have been no independent evaluations 
of its cost-effectiveness or its capacity to achieve sustainable 
reading skills on a large scale.

Saakshar Bharat Mission, India’s nationwide, government-
sponsored literacy programme, was launched in 2009. 
Public awareness and acceptance of it have been raised 
through extensive use of the mass media. The programme 
aims to achieve the government target of an 80% national 
adult literacy rate, and to provide functional literacy 
to 70 million people, of whom 60 million are women. 
Women’s literacy skills are linked ‘with empowerment of 
women’ and thus ‘inclusive growth in the sociocultural, 
economic and political spheres.’ Saakshar Bharat also 

aims to reach 1.5 million adults with a basic education 
programme and the same number with a vocational skills 
development programme. As with other such campaigns, 
its cost-effectiveness and capacity to promote sustainable 
reading skills on a large scale have not been evaluated 
independently.

South Africa’s Kha Ri Gude Mass Literacy Programme, 
launched in April 2008, aimed to make 4.7 million adults 
literate by the end of 2012. Most participants have been 
women. The learning materials follow an integrated approach 
to acquiring literacy, drawing on ‘language experience’ 
and ‘whole word’ concepts and including recent findings of 
neuro-cognitive research. Materials are highly structured, 
with built-in sequenced activities to teach reading and 
writing, including learning games that help learners develop 
the required reading speed to read with understanding 
and acquire sustainable literacy skill levels. The curriculum 
is organized around eight themes which are relevant to 
learners’ motivation. Instead of a final exam, assessment 
is based on internal evidence in the form of a standardized 
assessment tool (all learners perform the same tasks and 
are marked against the same criteria). Learners are tested 
continuously through a Learner Assessment Portfolio of 
10 literacy assessment activities in their mother tongue 
and 10 numeracy activities. The activities are competence-
based and time-linked to the stages of the learning process. 
The portfolios are marked by the facilitator, moderated by 
supervisors and controlled by coordinators, then returned 
to the campaign head office where final marking is verified 
by the South African Qualifications Authority. The available 
data would have allowed longitudinal evaluations of the 
programme’s effectiveness, but such research has not yet 
been conducted.

GOAL 4: ADULT LITERACYExplaining limited progress in adult literacythe weakest point in literacy programmes. Many 
systems continue to rely on volunteers, such 
as the Brasil Alfabetizado programme or the 
National Literacy Programme in Ghana. 

Overall, despite the renewed interest 
of governments and the ambition that 
characterised approaches to literacy campaigns 
after 2000, they have not had a major global 
impact on improving literacy skills. 

Progress in recognizing the importance of 
the mother tongue

The Dakar Framework for Action stressed 
‘the importance of local languages for initial 
literacy’. After Dakar, there were increasing calls 
for adult literacy based on the mother tongue, 
supported by research on multilingual education 
in formal and non-formal settings. However, 
many leaders, while recognizing the educational 
benefits of using learners’ first language, 
have been ambivalent about the feasibility of 
multilingual approaches, fearing division or 
conflict in situations of linguistic diversity.

The impact of this hesitation by leaders has 
rarely been spelled out for the conduct of adult 
literacy programmes. Multilingual approaches 
have greater credibility today than at the start 
of the EFA period, but are only slowly being 
translated into tangible benefits. Even countries 
with a relatively long history of these approaches 
rely on non-state actors and specialized 
institutes rather than mainstreaming efforts into 
national planning and budgeting.

The closer practitioners come to the realities of 
communities speaking non-dominant languages, 
the better they understand that the language 
of learning is a barrier when it is not the local 
language. Conversely, the more leaders set 
their sights on the global arena, market and 
connections, the less attention they appear to 
give to local realities and community needs.

In Mexico’s most recent (2010) census, speakers 
of indigenous languages represented about 
6.6 million people, some 6.5% of the population 
(INEGI, 2012). A government initiative, Modelo 
Educación para la Vida y el Trabajo (Learning 
Model for Life and Work), launched in 2000, 
was designed to address indigenous groups 
through their own language, with the possibility 

of learning and using Spanish as well. Two 
learning tracks were developed for indigenous 
communities: one for bilingual speakers and one 
for those initially monolingual in an indigenous 
language (Robinson, 2015). Since 2007, stronger 
government emphasis on marginalized groups, 
particularly indigenous populations, has led to 
the use of more languages – now 45 of them 
– in learning literacy, and the development of 
learning materials in each (Gobierno de México, 
2012). However, while the current national 
education plan identifies indigenous populations 
as facing a particular literacy challenge, it 
proposes no specific actions, only referring to a 
need for contextually appropriate programmes. 
Also, it proposes no strategies for adult literacy 
(Robinson, 2015).

In Morocco, the only government-sanctioned 
languages were modern standard Arabic and 
French until the mid-1990s. The use, let alone 
promotion, of Amazigh was discouraged. The 
change of language policy is evidenced by 
constitutional reform. The 1996 constitution 
designated Arabic as the official language. The 
2011 constitution refers to ‘protection of the 
languages and cultural expressions practised 
in Morocco’, gives language a separate clause, 
and designates both Arabic and Amazigh as 
official languages. Neither constitution mentions 
French. Under the new constitution, public 
offices increasingly display their titles in both 
Arabic and Amazigh, but there is almost no 
daily written use of Amazigh. In 2005–2008, a 
joint project between the Ministry of Education’s 
Department for the Struggle against Illiteracy 
and USAID introduced the approach of using 
a ‘language bridge’ in female adult literacy 
programmes, designed to inform them of the 
new family legal framework. This approach 
taught adult women to first write in their mother 
tongues before bridging to broader literacy skills 
in Arabic (Robinson, 2015).

Papua New Guinea has 838 languages, the 
most of any country in the world (Lewis et al., 
2013). English is the official language, while 
the pidgin languages Tok Pisin and Hiri Motu 
are both recognised as lingua francas for wider 
communication. Papua New Guinea’s 1975 
constitution includes a clause on promoting 
literacy and exhorts all persons and governmental 
bodies to endeavour to achieve universal literacy

in 2000 clearly linked literacy acquisition with 
linguistic context. Four of its five goals for 
literacy are related to language choice, the 
intent clearly being to make literacy accessible 
in the languages people speak. A report on adult 
education notes an increase in the use of Tok 
Pisin and lists a further 13 languages that serve 
as regional lingua francas (Papua New Guinea 
National Department of Education, 2008). 
However, strong commitments by non-state 
actors in adult literacy resulted in disengagement 
by the government and a consequent lack of 
public investment in adult literacy. The most 
recent assessments show there is a long way to 
go, even in Tok Pisin (Robinson, 2015).

Since 2000, conditions have been more 
favourable in many low literacy countries for 
increasing focus on the use of mother tongue 
as the medium of instruction in adult literacy 
programmes. However, either because of 
logistical constraints or because of ambivalent 
attitudes by political leaders, they have not yet 
made a major contribution to improving adult 
literacy skills on a sufficiently large scale.

Changes in daily life have not led to a 
strong increase in the demand for literacy

Parents that have faced the hardships of not being 
able to write letters, use mobile phones or ATMs 
do all they can to provide their children with an 
education so they don’t ever become excluded due 
to illiteracy. 

– Omovigho Rani Ebireri,  
University of Maiduguri, Nigeria

It is unlikely that literacy skills can ever be 
promoted among adults unless demand for 
literacy is also increased. Literacy requires not 
only a better supply of learning opportunities 
but also more opportunities to use, improve and 
retain literacy skills. 

Such opportunities have been growing since 
2000. Favourable contexts have emerged in 
which a strong literate environment contributes 
to acquisition and retention of literacy skills 
through collaboration at the community level, 
for example in agricultural marketing, public 
health interventions, microfinance initiatives or 
water management investments (Easton, 2015). 
In addition, rapid changes in communication 

technology have brought with them new 
opportunities to use literacy. However, despite 
a growing recognition that literacy programmes 
need to be attached to these opportunities, the 
impact on literacy skill acquisition has not yet 
been perceptible.

Projects related to agricultural marketing 
and livelihood development have involved 
building literacy skills. In Cameroon, Mali and 
Mozambique, community-level management 
skills and capacities, including literacy, were 
successfully developed through cooperative 
strategies to improve opportunities for small 
farmers to benefit from market participation, 
where previously this had been a source of 
exploitation (Bingen, Serrano et al., 2003). 
Participatory action research has been used in 
Latin America to help farmers understand the 
full cycle from their fields to consumers’ tables, 
and to identify where they could intervene more 
productively, what they needed to learn to do so, 
and how to fulfil these learning needs, including 
better literacy skills (Ashby et al., 2009).

Local organization and management of new 
health services has also been linked with 
literacy. Among indigenous Ayta communities 
of Luzon in the Philippines, an essential part 
of the training of new village health workers 
was involvement in animated discussions of the 
meanings of personal, family and community 
health and their socio-political implications 
(Estacio, 2013). In Gnagna and Koulpeologo 
provinces of Burkina Faso, a reproductive 
health initiative supported by an international 
NGO led to training in gynaecology and long-
term contraceptive measures that incorporated 
literacy into public health interventions 
(Lankoande and McKaig, 2005).

Microfinance initiatives have continued to be 
used as a lever to help households escape 
poverty but have also created opportunities to 
use literacy and numeracy skills, in the context 
of growing monetization and more frequent 
market exchanges. As part of such initiatives, 
cooperatives have trained community leaders 
in simple accounting, loan management and 
assessment of creditworthiness. Community 
members have been encouraged to apply for 
credit in writing. Leaders of local institutions 
gradually trained themselves to carry out formal 
assessments of the feasibility of proposed loans 

Literacy requires 
not only a 
better supply 
of learning 
opportunities 
but also more 
opportunities 
to use, improve 
and retain 
literacy skills

GOAL 4: ADULT LITERACYExplaining limited progress in adult literacyand provide potential borrowers with technical 
assistance to ensure the creditworthiness of 
their ventures (Easton, 2015). An NGO-sponsored 
initiative to establish a microfinance institution 
in six villages in Karnataka state, India, created 
an innovative model of community mobilization. 
Rather than enrolling only educated clients 
or training poorer and less literate ones, the 
institution’s officers bridged the gap. They 
created self-help groups in which literate 
participants could explain management issues to 
those initially less capable (Brook et al., 2008).

Common resource management initiatives also 
create opportunities where literacy skills are 
needed. At the non-formal Farmer Water School 
in Kurnool district of Andhra Pradesh state, 
India, trainees valued literacy as an important 
skill for decision-making on water management 
and crop choices (Chavva and Smith, 2012). 
However, literacy skills, while valued, were 
not necessary for all farmers to improve their 
groundwater and crop management. This 
suggests that despite many changes in rural 
economies and society, the relatively slow pace 
of change may have often not been fast enough 
for adults to need literacy skills. Combined with 
the small scale of interventions that have tried to 
match community development with literacy skill 
acquisition, this may help explain why demand 
for literacy has grown less than expected, 
and literacy outcomes have not improved 
among adults. 

However, another change, the rapid expansion of 
communication technologies, holds considerable 
promise. It is easy to underestimate the pace of 
transformation. The Jomtien EFA Declaration 
made no mention of ‘computer’ or ‘internet’. While 
these words appear in the 2000 Dakar Framework, 
they occur only twice in the 78 page document, 
and then only in relation to what schools 
should do to promote equitable learning. In 
the meantime, mobile phone use has grown 
exponentially even in low literacy societies. Could 
mobile devices change the literacy environment?

Internet access still remains low in much of 
sub-Saharan Africa, but it may be possible to 
take advantage of the universality of mobile 
phones to promote stronger literacy environments 
and reading practices. People already use 
mobile devices for banking, bill paying and 

social communication. They even participate in 
democratic practices, such as engaging with 
political leaders via SMS (Asino et al., 2011). A 
recent comparative survey of the use of mobile 
devices, completed by over 4,000 people in 
seven countries (Ethiopia, Ghana, India, Kenya, 
Nigeria, Pakistan and Zimbabwe), found that 
while more men read books on mobile phones 
than women, women spent many more hours 
reading than men did. The Worldreader’s mobile 
application also demonstrates how technology 
helps create a literacy environment and 
encourages reading. In 2013, 334,000 unique users 
per month accessed books and stories for free in 
English as well as other languages including Hindi, 
Kiswahili, Twi and Yoruba (West and Chew, 2014). 
Educational exercises on mobile phones, when 
added to an adult education programme in Niger, 
improved reading and numeracy outcomes 
significantly more than in programmes without 
mobile phones (Aker et al., 2012).

The potential of mobile phones to increase 
demand for literacy skills may become apparent 
in coming years. Using mobile phones to 
text and email enhances the use of text as 
communication. But clear evidence is lacking of 
their impact on improving literacy skills.  

Conclusions

Many positive developments must be 
acknowledged in approaches to adult literacy 
since 2000. There has been a clear trend towards 
measuring literacy skills on a continuum as 
opposed to either/or assessments. Resources 
developed by LAMP, PIAAC and STEP will 
be valuable for the development of national 
monitoring. Some of these conceptualizations 
have influenced policy and programme 
development in many countries.

However, very few countries met the EFA literacy 
target of halving their 2000 adult illiteracy rate by 
2015. Moreover, adults whose literacy is estimated 
in later years received more schooling than the 
adults whose literacy was estimated in earlier 
years. When it is possible to follow a cohort over 
time, there are few countries where women 
increased their literacy rates as adults. Thus even 
the limited progress in women’s adult literacy

of younger, better educated women replacing 
older, less educated ones.

Four factors may help explain this poor record. 
First of all, global commitment was weak. Calls 
for action to focus on a more holistic view of 
literacy at the global level were not matched by 
a willingness to adequately fund programmes at 
the national level. Second, large, nationally owned 
literacy campaigns and programmes re-emerged 
after a relative decline in the 1990s, but the lack 
of coordination and capacity appear to have 
prevented them from making a visible impact. 
This is also true of genuine attempts to introduce 
mother tongue as a medium of instruction in adult 
literacy programmes. Finally, despite apparently 
favourable conditions that could increase 
the demand for literacy among individuals in 
developing countries, programmes have not been 
sufficiently linked to such opportunities.

Goal 5: Gender parity

153

Highlights ■At the primary level, 69% of countries with data have achieved or are likely to reach gender parity by 2015. Progress is slower in secondary enrolment with fewer than half projected to reach gender parity by 2015. ■Progress in tackling severe gender disparity has been made. Between 1999 and 2012, the number of countries with fewer than 90 girls enrolled for every 100 boys fell from 33 to just 16. ■In sub-Saharan Africa, the poorest girls remain most likely to never attend primary school. In Guinea and Niger in 2012, approximatively 70% of the poorest girls had never attended primary school, compared with less than 20% of the richest boys. ■The recruitment of female teachers at all levels of education, textbook and curriculum reform, and training in gender-sensitive teaching are critical to improving gender equality in schools. ■Global and national advocacy has led to improvements in girls’ education and progress in reducing gender gaps. However, policies that tackle child marriage and school-related gender-based violence need to be strengthened. ■Boys experience disparities in secondary education. Although gaps have narrowed or closed in many rich countries, they have widened in others, and the problem is emerging in some poorer countries.1025Gender parity and equality ...........155

There has been strong movement 
worldwide towards greater gender 
parity, particularly in primary education. 
This chapter reviews global progress 
towards gender parity and equality since 
Dakar. It reviews policies and practices 
that have successfully increased the 
demand for girls’ education, ranging 
from gender mainstreaming and 
policy reform to improving school 
infrastructure, reducing early marriage 
and adolescent pregnancy, and creating 
equitable school and classroom 
environments. However, many 
challenges remain, and this chapter 
also calls attention to persistent gender 
disparity in educational attainment.

Morocco has mobilized significant human and financial resources to 
develop a strategy to fight against disparities between girls and boys, 
having achieved significant results in terms of parity. This strategy is 
based on the implementation of a new adapted model of community 
schools, social support to reduce the impact of socioeconomic 
factors, and the development of non-formal education.”

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALL1025Education for All Global Monitoring Report  Goal 5    Gender parity and equality

Eliminating gender disparities in primary and secondary education by 2005, and 
achieving gender equality in education by 2015, with a focus on ensuring girls’ 
full and equal access to and achievement in basic education of good quality.

For a combination of reasons – many of which have 
a gendered dimension – millions of girls and boys 
around the world still face considerable difficulty 
in getting access to, attending and progressing 
through school, and learning well while there. This 
chapter of the EFA Global Monitoring Report (GMR) 
looks retrospectively at policies and programmes 
relating to achieving gender parity and equality in 
education, with the central understanding that all 
children – girls and boys – have a basic right to 
education opportunities to enable them to reach 
their full potential in life. It explores progress 
towards the realization of goal 5, as well as 
barriers that continue to prevent it.

The realization of gender equality in education 
remains a serious issue of social justice. Gender 
equality is a more complex notion than gender 
parity and harder to measure. It requires moving 
beyond counting the numbers of boys and girls 
in school to exploring the quality of girls’ and 
boys’ experiences in the classroom and school 
community, their achievements in education 
institutions and their aspirations for the future.

Since the World Education Forum in Dakar in 
2000, uneven progress has been made towards 
realizing gender parity in primary education. 
Although the target of reaching gender parity in 
primary enrolment by 2005 was missed, trend 
projections made for this GMR indicate that 
69% of countries with data will have achieved it 
by 2015. Progress towards eliminating gender 
disparities in secondary education has been 
much less marked; only 48% of countries will 
have reached parity by 2015 (Bruneforth, 2015). 

Goal 5 calls for eliminating disparities in 
both primary and secondary education. Of 
145 countries with data for both levels, less 
than half, 43%, have achieved gender parity in 
enrolments for both primary and secondary, or 
are likely to do so by 2015. Just over one-quarter, 
27%, are likely to reach gender parity in primary 
education, but not in secondary education. But 
progress has been made, and accelerated, 
over the last fifteen years: analysis of trend 

projections detailed elsewhere in this GMR 
show that the number of countries at parity in 
both primary and secondary will be 62 by 2015, 
whereas if trends for 1990–1999 had continued 
at the same pace, this number would have stood 
at only 25 (Bruneforth, 2015). 

Following an overview of progress towards  
gender parity in primary and secondary education, 
this chapter discusses efforts by government and 
civil society to build support for gender equality. 
Framed by consideration of children’s rights to, 
within and through education, the rest of the chapter 
examines policies to address economic and social 
barriers to girls’ and boys’ education, including 
supply-side interventions to improve accessibility 
and school infrastructure, and measures to enhance 
gender equality within schools. A final section 
highlights the gender dimensions of learning 
outcomes and subject choice.

Progress towards gender parity

Progress has been made in primary 
education, but more needs to be done

Gender disparity in primary enrolment has 
been substantially reduced since 1999, but 
not eliminated. Among the 161 countries with 
data for 1999 and 2012, the number at parity 
– measured by a gender parity index (GPI) of 
between 0.97 and 1.03 – rose from 83 in 1999  
to 104 in 2012. The number of countries with 
a GPI under 0.97 – with fewer girls enrolled 
relative to boys – dropped from 73 to 48. Of 
countries yet to achieve parity by 2012, a majority 
had disparities at the expense of girls and only  
nine at the expense of boys.

There was particular improvement in reducing 
gender disparity in primary enrolment in  
South and West Asia, where the regional 
GPI increased from 0.83 in 1999 to parity in 
2012. Regional averages mask wide variation 
among countries, however. Only four of the 

69% of 
countries 
will achieve 
gender parity 
in primary 
education by 
2015 

155

GOAL 5: GENDER PARITY AND EQUALITYProgress towards gender parityeight countries with data over the period 
achieved parity: Bhutan, India, the Islamic 
Republic of Iran and Sri Lanka. Despite 
considerable progress in getting girls into 
school, Afghanistan had just 72 girls enrolled for 
every 100 boys. In Nepal, previous gender gaps 
have been reversed, with more girls than boys 
enrolled in primary education in 2012.

often starting from a point of severe 
disadvantage for girls (Figure 5.1). Burundi  
was far from parity in 1999, with 79 girls  
enrolled for every 100 boys, but it had 
eliminated this gender gap by 2012. Other 
countries, including Benin, Burkina Faso and 
Morocco, while not achieving parity, made 
notable progress.

The regional GPIs for primary enrolment  
in the Arab States, 0.93 in 2012, and  
sub-Saharan Africa, 0.92, represent 
improvement but not parity. There has been 
 a clear trend of reducing gender disparity  
in the primary gross enrolment ratio for a 
majority of countries in these two regions,  

Countries where gender gaps have been 
reversed underline the dynamic nature of 
achieving gender parity. Careful analysis of 
these trends is needed to inform future policy. 
In Gambia, Nepal and Senegal, increases in the 
ratio of girls’ enrolment relative to boys’ reflect 
not only a slight advantage in girls’ enrolment at

boys dropping out of school. In Senegal in 1999, 
81 boys were leaving primary school for every 
100 girls. By 2011, the situation was reversed: 
113 boys dropped out for every 100 girls. Caution 
is needed, therefore, in understanding changes 
in gender parity, which might reflect undesirable 
developments in the education system.

Progress in countries where girls faced  
the greatest disadvantage

Since 1999, important progress has been made 
in reducing gender gaps in primary enrolment 
in many of the countries where girls faced the 
worst disadvantage. Of the 161 countries with 

data for both 1999 and 2012, 33 – including 20 
in sub-Saharan Africa – had severe disparities 
at the expense of girls in 1999, with fewer than 
90 girls enrolled for every 100 boys; by 2012 the 
number had fallen to 16. Afghanistan, the lowest 
ranking country in 1999, has overcome immense 
obstacles to raise its estimated primary gross 
enrolment ratio for girls from less than 4% 
in 1999 to 87% in 2012, resulting in its GPI 
increasing from 0.08 to 0.72.

Figure 5.2 compares progress in countries with 
data for 1990, 1999 and 2012. Among the 28 
countries with GPIs below 0.90 in 1999, 16 had 
passed this threshold by 2012. Of these, Bhutan, 
Burundi and India achieved gender parity,

GOAL 5: GENDER PARITY AND EQUALITYProgress towards gender parityand in some countries that had not reached 
gender parity, the index still increased 
dramatically. Benin, Burkina Faso,  
Guinea-Bissau and Senegal progressed  
faster in 1999–2012 than in 1990–1999.  
Comoros, Morocco and Pakistan built on 
progress from the 1990s to move towards  
gender parity after Dakar.

In Ethiopia 
and Senegal,

reduced the 
gender gap

Countries such as Guatemala and Morocco,  
close to the goal of gender parity and with high 
overall enrolment, need to increase efforts to 
address obstacles to schooling faced by the  
most marginalized girls. Djibouti, Eritrea and 
Niger, all of which had a gross enrolment ratio 
of less than 80% in 2012, face the dual challenge 
of increasing the number of children in school 
while continuing efforts to reduce severe 
gender disparity.

The poorest girls remain the least likely  
to enrol

Understanding the patterns behind gender 
differences in school enrolment is important, 
particularly in countries still struggling to 
increase enrolment overall. Do children  
enter school and then drop out? Do they  
fail to enrol in the first place? About 43% of  
the world’s out-of-school children will never  
go to school. Considerable gender disparity 
exists: 48% of girls are likely never to enrol, 
compared with 37% of boys. But boys are  
more likely to leave school early: 26%,  
compared with 20% of girls (see Figure 0.5,  
in the Overview). Analysis of household survey 
data from low and middle income countries 
shows that in countries with large populations  
of primary-age children who have never  
attended school, girls are still less likely than 
boys to go to school, particularly among the 
poorest children.

During the 2000s, 9 of 10 countries with  
the highest percentages of children who had 
never attended school were in sub-Saharan 
Africa (Figure 5.3). While the overall proportion 
of children who had never attended school  
fell, gender disparity remained in most of  
these countries. The poorest girls continued  
to be most likely never to have attended. In  
Niger and Guinea, approximately 70% of the 
poorest girls had never attended school –  
notably higher than the share of the poorest 
boys – compared with less than 20% of the 
richest boys.

In Ethiopia and Senegal, education policies 
targeting girls supported progress to reduce  
the gender gap between the poorest girls and 
boys, although large numbers of both still 
missed out on school. In Pakistan, between 
2006 and 2012, little progress was made in 
reducing the proportion of the poorest children 
who had never attended and in reducing the 
gender gap of 18 percentage points between the 
poorest girls and boys. By contrast, among the 
richest children, little gender disparity existed 
in either year.

Once in school, girls progress  
alongside boys 

When enrolled, girls stand an equal or  
better chance than boys of continuing to the 
upper grades of primary school: survival rates  
to grade 5 for girls have consistently been 
equal to or higher than those of boys in many 
countries. Of 68 countries with data for both 
years, 57 had either parity in grade 5 survival 
rates or disparity at the expense of boys in 1999, 
and 58 in 2011. 

Even in countries where girls are severely 
disadvantaged at the point of initial intake, 
survival rates to grade 5 among enrolled 
children generally show narrower gender gaps 
or none at all. In Cameroon and Côte d’Ivoire, 
countries with a GPI of less than 0.90 for gross 
intake rates, survival rates for girls and boys are 
at parity (Figure 5.4).

In the few countries where boys are 
disadvantaged at the point of intake, including 
Gambia, Malawi and Nepal, gross enrolment 
ratios are lower for boys than for girls. In 

countries where no gender gap exists in intake 
rates but boys are disadvantaged in terms 
of survival to grade 5, such as Bangladesh, 
Myanmar and the United Republic of Tanzania, 
boys are at higher risk of dropout.

Poverty deepens gender disparities in 
primary education completion

Using a measure of school completion – the 
primary attainment rate – that includes all 
school-age children in a population rather 
than just those enrolled, gender disparity in 
completion of primary schooling has often 
remained far wider among the poorest  
children than the richest (Figure 5.5). Despite 
overall progress in reducing gender disparity 
in primary attainment since 2000, the poorest 
girls still face severe disadvantage in entering 
and completing primary education. In countries 
such as the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, 
Mozambique and Uganda, where gender parity 
in primary attainment has been achieved since 
2000 for the richest girls, the poorest girls 
still lag far behind the poorest boys. In the 
Lao People’s Democratic Republic, among the

richest children the proportion of girls who 
attained full primary education rose from 88 per 
100 boys in 2000 to parity in 2010, while among 
the poorest children it fell from 77 to 70 girls 
per 100 boys.

Countries including Brazil, the Dominican 
Republic and Nicaragua have seen gender 
disparity in primary attainment at the  
expense of the poorest boys improve since  
2000, while in countries including Haiti and 
Zimbabwe, wide disparities have emerged,  
with the poorest boys now less likely to  
complete primary education. Strategies 
to address the emergence of low primary 
attainment among poorer boys need to  
tackle why boys leave school early. Getting  
more girls, particularly those who are poor  
and disadvantaged, into school in the first  
place remains a necessary goal for countries 
seeking to improve overall attainment for  
girls. But careful examination of patterns at 
entry point and in subsequent grades is also 
required to ensure equitable participation 
and completion of primary education for both 
girls and boys.

Gender disparity is wider and more varied 
in secondary education

Gender disparity is found in a greater number  
of countries in secondary education than  
it is in primary. By 2012, 63% of countries 
with data had yet to achieve gender parity in 
secondary enrolment. The numbers of countries 
with disparities at the expense of boys and  
of girls were equal: in nearly 32%, fewer than 
97 girls were enrolled for every 100 boys; in the 
same share, girls outpaced boys.

The picture varies by region. In sub-Saharan 
Africa and South and West Asia, girls continue to 
be more disadvantaged in secondary enrolment. 
In sub-Saharan Africa, the average number of 
girls enrolled relative to boys has only risen 
slightly since 1999, to 84 for every 100 boys in 
2012. In South and West Asia, despite greater 
progress, 93 girls on average were enrolled for 
every 100 boys in 2012. In Latin America and the 
Caribbean, by contrast, a GPI of 1.07 in 2012, 
unchanged from 1999, reflects fewer boys than 
girls enrolled in a majority of countries – on 
average, 93 boys for every 100 girls.

GOAL 5: GENDER PARITY AND EQUALITYProgress towards gender parityOverall, gender disparities are narrowing. Of 
133 countries with data in both years, 30 had a 
GPI of less than 0.90 in 1999, indicating severe 
disadvantage for girls. By 2012, this was the case 
for just 19 countries, of which the majority were 
in the Arab States or sub-Saharan Africa. The 
number of countries where boys faced severe 
disadvantage – a GPI of greater than 1.11 – 
declined from 18 to 9 over the period (Figure 5.6).

The most extreme cases of disparity are still 
at girls’ expense. Despite progress since 1999, 
in 2012, 13 countries had fewer than 80 girls 
enrolled in secondary education for every 100 
boys. In Angola, the situation actually worsened, 
from 76 girls per 100 boys in 1999 to 65 in 2012. 
In Central African Republic and Chad, both 

recently affected by conflict, approximately half 
as many girls as boys were enrolled in secondary 
school in 2012.

Changes in the pattern of boys’ disadvantage in 
secondary education have varied since 1999. In 
a number of middle and high income countries 
with high levels of secondary enrolment overall, 
persistent gender gaps at the expense of boys 
have narrowed, closing in all Western European 
countries except Finland and Luxembourg by 
2012. In Mongolia and South Africa, strong 
progress in reducing disparities saw both 
countries close to achieving gender parity. 
In some richer countries such as Argentina, 
Suriname and several Caribbean countries, 
gender gaps in secondary enrolment have

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 51025Education for All Global Monitoring Reportwidened, and have emerged in a few poorer 
countries including Bangladesh, Myanmar 
and Rwanda. In Lesotho, only 71 boys were 
enrolled for every 100 girls in 2012, a ratio 
unchanged since 1999. 

Poor primary attainment and dropout from 
secondary education reinforce disparity

Gender disparity in the numbers of children 
entering and completing lower secondary 
schooling has narrowed, although parity  
has yet to be achieved in many countries. 
Analysis of household survey data from 78 
countries for this GMR shows that, on average, 
the number of girls attaining lower secondary 
increased from 81 per 100 boys in 2000 to 93 

in 2010. Most disparity in lower secondary 
attainment in these countries is accounted for 
by initial disparity in primary attainment. While 
enrolled boys and girls made the transition from 
the final primary grade into lower secondary 
in equal numbers, the average number of girls 
reaching that final primary grade was 93 for 
every 100 boys in 2010, leaving greater numbers 
of girls behind.

However, the group average masks considerable 
differences. In poorer countries where girls have 
historically been disadvantaged, gender disparity 
in lower secondary attainment remains a serious 
issue, though progress has been made. In richer 
countries, a rise in disparity at the expense of 
boys is observed.

GOAL 5: GENDER PARITY AND EQUALITYProgress towards gender paritySome poorer countries, such as Malawi and 
Cambodia, have seen considerable progress 
towards parity in lower secondary attainment, 
driven almost exclusively by progress in reducing 
disparity in primary attainment. Cambodia, 
where only 66 girls attained a primary education 
for every 100 boys in 2000, achieved parity 
within 10 years. This contributed to its progress 
towards parity in lower secondary, achieving 
a GPI of 0.90 in 2010. Malawi made a strong 
move towards parity in primary attainment. But 
disparity remained at all three points: in 2010 
for every 100 boys, 90 girls attained primary, 
82 made the transition to lower secondary and 
only 75 survived through to the end of lower 
secondary. In both countries, disparities increase 
at entry to and completion of lower secondary, 
indicating important bottlenecks (Figure 5.7).

In the richer countries of Brazil and Tunisia, 
disparity in lower secondary attainment has 
widened at the expense of boys, primarily as 
a result of increasing dropout among boys. In 
Brazil, the GPI for lower secondary attainment 
rose from 1.12 in 2000 to 1.18 in 2010. In Tunisia, 
parity in primary attainment and entry to lower 
secondary, previously at the expense of girls, 
was achieved by 2010, but fewer boys than girls 
now persist to the last grade of lower secondary. 
In Viet Nam, a previous gender gap has 
largely disappeared.

Boys are even more likely than girls to drop  
out in upper secondary. For the 78 countries with 
data, only 95 boys for every 100 girls survived to 
the end of upper secondary in 2010, with little 
change since 2000. In countries where boys 
were already disadvantaged in lower secondary 
attainment, such as Brazil, this widened disparity 
still further. 

Completion rates for adolescent boys have been  
a growing concern in many OECD countries, 
where in 2011 on average 73% of girls completed 
upper secondary education on time but only  
63% of boys did. Girls’ graduation rates from 
upper secondary school exceed those of boys in 
all  OECD countries except Germany. The gaps 
were widest in Iceland and Portugal, where 
graduation rates among girls exceeded those of 
boys by 20% or more (OECD, 2012c).

Promoting an enabling 
environment

Sustained global advocacy has led to 
unprecedented government and civil society 
support for gender parity and equality in 
education in recent years, particularly for girls’ 
access to schooling (see Overview). In 2000, 
the Dakar Framework for Action and the UN 
Millennium Development Goals directed the 
international community to eliminate gender 
disparity in primary and secondary education. 
In addition, the Dakar Framework laid out key 
strategies to achieve gender equality by 2015. 
Also launched in 2000, the United Nations 
Girls’ Education Initiative (UNGEI) was the 
first global partnership to specifically promote 
girls’ education and raise awareness of gender 
equality issues in education.

Governments, in turn, have implemented 
legislative and policy reform; mainstreamed 
gender into education institutional structures, 
planning and budgeting; and built a critical 
mass of support within societies. Civil society 
action has brought increased awareness of 
the importance of girls’ education. While the 
goal of gender parity in education by 2005 was 
not met, and significant obstacles to achieving 
both parity and equality remain, there has been 
increased engagement with gender issues in 
education since 2000.

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 51025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportGender mainstreaming and budgeting 
provide a focus

Gender mainstreaming aims to make gender 
equality a central ideal reflected in the 
structures and practices of institutions and 
society as a whole rather than a separate 
issue or sector. The Dakar Framework calls for 
government commitment to mainstreaming 
gender throughout education systems.

The Beijing Platform for Action, agreed at the 
1995 World Conference on Women in Beijing, 
endorsed gender mainstreaming as a crucial 
tool for achieving commitment to gender 
equality (UNESCO and UN Women, 2014). A 
key aim was to integrate a gender perspective 
in policy, programming and budgeting across 
ministries (UN, 1995).

During the two decades since Beijing, policies 
towards gender mainstreaming in the education 
sector have been widely adopted (Unterhalter 
et al., 2010). In Burkina Faso, the government’s 
education plan for 2001–2010 put in place 
strategies to strengthen the Directorate for 
the Promotion of Girls’ Education, part of 
the Ministry of Basic Education and Literacy 
(UNESCO, 2008b). In Yemen, the Community 
Participation Unit was set up in 2003 and 
the Girls’ Education Sector was established 
in 2006, both created within the Ministry of 
Education to enact the National Girls’ Education 
Strategy (Kefaya, 2007). In Burkina Faso, girls’ 
primary gross enrolment ratio increased by 
47% between 1999 and 2005; in Yemen, it 
increased by 46%.

The UN Development Fund for Women, now  
UN Women, promotes gender responsive 
budgeting in over 60 countries worldwide  
(UN Women, 2012b). The approach scrutinizes 
government budgetary practices for their 
differing effects on men and women, girls and 
boys (Unterhalter, 2007). It also enables civil 
society groups to hold governments accountable 
for their commitment to gender equality 
(Global Campaign for Education and RESULTS 
Education Fund, 2011). In the United Republic 
of Tanzania, the Gender Budgeting Initiative has 
helped recognize and reduce girls’ household 
labour time by providing better community 
water facilities (Plan International, 2012; UN 
Women, 2012a).

Research suggests that investing adequate 
resources throughout the education system for 
gender mainstreaming strategies helps ensure 
gender equality in educational institutions 
(Unterhalter et al., 2014). Yet, in many countries, 
gender mainstreaming initiatives have faced 
constraints. Achieving transformative change 
in institutional settings remains an enormous 
challenge. Resources to effect change have 
been inadequate, gender units marginalized 
within institutions, advocacy support insufficient, 
and implementation limited by entrenched 
forms of discrimination (Subrahmanian, 2006; 
Unterhalter et al., 2010). The success of the 
Shiksha Karmi Project in Rajasthan, India, which 
aimed to involve men and women from remote 
communities in improving children’s access 
to education, was undermined by persistent 
discriminatory attitudes towards women among 
some project leaders (Jain, 2003).

Legislation and policy reform 
underpin progress

Progress towards greater equity in education has 
been supported by legal and policy commitments. 
In UNESCO’s recent overview of measures 
supporting the right to education, 40 of the 
59 reporting member states refer explicitly to 
guaranteeing girls’ and women’s right to education 
or to forbidding gender-based discrimination 
in national constitutions, legislation or specific 
policies (UNESCO and UN Women, 2014).

The OECD’s 2012 Social Institutions and Gender 
Index (SIGI) shows that since 2009 many non-
OECD countries have made promising progress 
in tackling discrimination against women and 
girls. The number of countries with specific 
legislation to combat domestic violence more 
than doubled, from 21 in 2009 to 53 in 2012, and 
29 countries established quotas for women’s 
political participation (OECD, 2012d).

Much more can be done. Despite positive steps, 
discriminatory social institutions continue to 
undermine gender equality. In 86 out of 121 
countries in the 2012 SIGI, discriminatory 
inheritance laws or practices persist. Although 
many countries have strengthened legislation 
banning early marriage, its prevalence across 
countries in 2012, at an average of 17% of 
women married between 15 and 19 years of age, 
remains unacceptably high (OECD, 2012d).

Despite 
positive steps, 
discriminatory 
social institutions 
continue to 
undermine 
gender equality

GOAL 5: GENDER PARITY AND EQUALITYPromoting an enabling environmentSeveral countries that reduced wide gender 
gaps in education, including Burkina Faso, 
Ethiopia, Ghana and Morocco, integrated a 
gender perspective into national education 
plans, strategic plans or policies, including 
the promotion of girls’ right to education and 
targeted responses to girls’ low enrolment 
(UNESCO and UN Women, 2014).

Analysis of education sector plans in 30 countries, 
carried out for this GMR, found that countries 
that included a gender goal in their plans in both 
2000 and 2012 made substantial gains towards 
gender parity in primary enrolment. Such 
countries include Burkina Faso, Mozambique 
and Sierra Leone. In the Gambia, Mauritania and 
Senegal, girls’ enrolment rose during this period 
to over half of total primary enrolment, effectively 
reversing the gender gap (UNESCO-IIEP, 2014).

Comprehensive policy frameworks have 
supported progress in countries with large 
gender gaps in participation

Effective policies to improve gender parity 
address barriers through multiple strategies. 
Countries that have made substantial progress 
on reducing wide gender gaps in education have 
in place comprehensive policy frameworks, 
underpinned by legislative reform, that combine 
a variety of measures to improve education 
access, especially for girls.

India and Turkey have closed gender gaps in 
primary and lower secondary education. In India, 
multiple strategies helped improve the accessibility 
and quality of girls’ schooling. They included free 
textbooks for all girls, back-to-school camps and 
bridging courses, recruitment of female teachers, 
and national programmes to increase demand 
for schooling among rural and disadvantaged 
girls (Govinda, 2008). In Turkey, legislative reform 
and school construction to expand participation 
in primary and lower secondary education were 
complemented by incentives for girls from poor 
households and a national awareness campaign  
to increase girls’ enrolment (Sasmaz, 2014).

Burundi and Ethiopia have significantly improved 
gender parity at the primary level while making 
rapid progress on overall enrolment. Both countries 
provided incentives for girls’ enrolment in grade 1 
at the official age to allow for primary education 
completion before puberty; in Burundi, parental 

contributions were waived for girls in the first year 
of primary school. Interventions to promote girls’ 
education included mothers’ groups in Burundi 
(Vachon, 2007) and community sensitization 
campaigns in Ethiopia (Bines, 2007). Legislative 
change to reduce child marriage has supported  
an enabling policy environment (Psaki, 2015).

Policies addressing gender disparity at the 
expense of boys, however, remain scarce and rarely 
form the comprehensive, multilevel frameworks 
developed for girls’ education. Often the focus is 
on boys’ poor achievement and disengagement 
from schooling. Countries in Latin America and the 
Caribbean, including Belize, El Salvador, Jamaica 
and Trinidad and Tobago, have introduced several 
stand-alone policies and interventions since 2000. 
These include strategies to mainstream technical 
and vocational subjects into the curriculum,  
school and community-based programmes to 
tackle youth crime and violence, and mentoring 
initiatives (Jha et al., 2012; Jha and Kelleher, 2006).

Increasing demand and 
supporting rights to education

The following section examines ways in which 
governments, non-government organizations 
(NGOs) and civil society have sought to 
overcome economic and sociocultural barriers 
to schooling and reduce gender gaps, and where 
there is evidence of progress. Three key areas 
of action are: promoting positive values and 
attitudes to girls’ education through community 
mobilization and advocacy campaigns, providing 
incentives to offset school and opportunity 
costs, and tackling early marriage and 
adolescent pregnancy.

Changing attitudes and mobilizing support 
for girls’ education 

Social institutions – formal and informal laws, 
and social and cultural norms and practices – 
can help explain why gender parity and equality 
in education have not been achieved in some 
countries. Policy interventions that do not 
account for discriminatory social institutions 
fail to tackle the drivers of gender inequality 
(OECD, 2012a). Analysis based on the 2012 
SIGI found that countries with higher levels 
of discrimination against women generally 

India and 
Turkey 
have closed 
gender gaps 
in primary 
and lower 
secondary 
education 

166

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 51025Education for All Global Monitoring Reportperformed worse on a range of development 
indicators, including education (OECD, 2012d).

Entrenched discriminatory social norms and 
attitudes to wider gender equality negatively 
affect demand for girls’ education and 
restrict the benefits of girls’ improved access 
to education. These norms are reflected in 
practices such as early marriage, traditional 
seclusion practices, the favouring of boys in 
families’ education investment and the gendered 
division of household labour (OECD, 2012d). In 
many countries, for example, women and girls 
take on the bulk of domestic work (Lyon et al., 
2013), including collecting fuel wood, hauling 
water and caring for younger siblings – all of 
which can limit children’s ability to attend school 
(Dreibelbis et al., 2013; Keilland, 2015; Nankhuni 
and Findeis, 2004). However, girls’ domestic 
work is nearly invisible, unlikely to be reached 
by child labour laws, and receives little attention 
from policy-makers (UNESCO, 2008b). 

Conversely, promoting the importance of 
education as a human right and increasing 
demand for schooling, particularly for 
girls, is linked with improving awareness of 
education’s economic and sociocultural value 
to individuals, families, communities and 
societies. National advocacy and community 
mobilization campaigns have been used as part 
of wider policy frameworks to change parental 
attitudes and build a groundswell of support for 
girls’ education. 

Early, large-scale social mobilization campaigns 
in the 1990s in Burkina Faso (Hickson et al., 
2003), Ethiopia (Bines, 2007) and Malawi (Rugh, 
2000) helped build extensive community support 
for girls’ education. Tajikistan’s National 
Strategy for Education Development (NSED) 
2015 included television and radio campaigns to 
promote girls’ education. The more recent NSED 
2020 continues the use of media campaigns, but 
aims specifically at improving the particularly 
low enrolment of girls in post-compulsory 
secondary education (UNICEF, 2013b), 90 girls 
for every 100 boys in 2012.

National education coalitions, representing civil 
society in political forums, can support advocacy 
for girls’ education and gender equality. The 
Global Campaign for Education, established 
in the lead-up to the Dakar conference, works 

with over 80 national education coalitions that 
represent civil society voices in political forums 
(Global Campaign for Education, 2014; Verger 
and Novelli, 2012). Its ‘Make It Right’ campaign 
calls for robust government plans to be drawn 
up in collaboration with civil society and backed 
by resources to achieve gender equality in 
education (Global Campaign for Education 
and RESULTS Education Fund, 2011). One of 
its members, the Ghana National Education 
Coalition Campaign, obtained a pledge by 
the Ministry of Education to develop a gender 
education policy, as part of the government 
agenda for 2012 (Global Campaign for Education, 
2012), to address gender disparity at the 
secondary level, where 91 girls were enrolled  
for every 100 boys.1

Community mobilization strategies have also 
been integrated into many non-government 
programmes and small-scale projects 
supporting girls’ education. In Burkina Faso, 
community mobilization activities were  
part of a project to provide quality, girl-friendly 
schools (Kazianga et al., 2012). In India, 
the District Primary Education Programme 
supported early initiatives to increase girls’ 
enrolment by mobilizing and organizing 
women through a women’s advocacy project 
(Unterhalter, 2007). 

Campaigns that have proved particularly 
effective engage partners from multiple  
sectors, are supported by national planning 
and policy, and directly involve grass-roots 
organizations and communities (Parkes and 
Heslop, 2013). In Turkey, the inclusion of 
multiple stakeholders in a national campaign to 
promote girls’ education resulted in increased 
enrolments in the targeted districts (Box 5.1). 
However, the example also underlines the 
challenges described above of entrenched 
social discrimination. Despite increased levels 
of schooling among young women, supported by 
this campaign, attitudes towards gender equality 
have not improved more broadly (Dincer et al., 
2014). Women’s rights are still not fully protected 
in Turkey’s constitution and penal code. High 
levels of domestic violence against women 
persist and women’s participation in the political 
arena and the labour market remains poor 
(Pasali, 2013).

GOAL 5: GENDER PARITY AND EQUALITYIncreasing demand and supporting rights to educationBox 5.1: Multiple stakeholders support campaign to promote girls’ education in Turkey

The ‘Hey Girls, Let’s Go to School!’ campaign, initiated by 
UNICEF Turkey and carried out in collaboration with the 
Ministry of National Education, supported government efforts 
to expand access to education and increase girls’ enrolment. 
The campaign was launched in 2003 in the 10 Turkish 
provinces with the most gender disparity in access to  
basic education.

Following a shift in approach, the campaign established a 
new model of relationships among a wide range of central 
and provincial stakeholders: officials met frequently to solve 
problems local teams faced. Both state officials and teachers 
were heavily involved in home visits – an effective strategy 
in persuading families to send girls to school. And local civil 
society organizations were made part of the campaign.

Since the ministry lacked accurate information on out-of-
school children, a steering committee sent consultants to the 
10 provinces to assess needs and inform local stakeholders 
about the campaign. This met with limited success due to 
the hierarchical structure of the Turkish education system: 
consultants were perceived as inspectors, and uptake of the 
campaign was poor.

The 10 provinces selected at the beginning of the campaign 
made better progress than the other Turkish provinces in 
closing gender gaps in enrolment. It is estimated that up to 
350,000 children were enrolled in school during the four 
years of the campaign.

Reducing costs of schooling

Throughout the Education for All era, global 
attention has been directed towards redressing 
gender disparities in enrolment and attainment 
by lowering school-related costs, which can 
disproportionately affect girls. In countries 
with low female enrolment and completion, 
strategies to increase parental demand through 
incentives have included targeted fee waivers 
and scholarships to offset direct school costs 
and cash stipends to reduce additional costs of 
schooling to families.

One commitment in Benin’s EFA national 
assessment plan in 2000 was to eliminate school 
fees for all girls in public primary schools in 
rural areas (Benin Ministry of Education and 
Scientific Research, 2000). Combined with 
community mobilization strategies to increase 
demand for girls’ education, this saw gender 
gaps at primary level reduced substantially, with 
the GPI increasing from 0.64 in 1999 to 0.89 in 
2012. In 2006, Yemen introduced a school fee and 
uniform waiver for all primary girls.

Scholarships and stipends can help girls 
continue in education. In Cambodia, scholarships 
for girls to make the transition from primary to 
secondary, conditional on regular attendance 
and grade progression, helped increase girls’ 
enrolment by between 22 and 32 percentage 
points (Filmer and Schady, 2008). In Punjab 
province in Pakistan, the Female School Stipend 

Programme was established in 2003, targeting 
girls in grades 6 to 8 in government schools 
in districts with the lowest literacy rates. This 
led to increased enrolment rates ranging from 
11% to 32% for all cohorts during the first four 
years of the programme (Independent Evaluation 
Group, 2011a).

Nevertheless, issues of equity remain a concern. 
In Bangladesh, despite the acclaimed success of 
a secondary school stipend programme for rural 
girls in increasing girls’ enrolment, data suggest 
girls from wealthier, landowning households 
benefited disproportionately (Khandker et al., 
2003). In Nepal, scholarships were not always 
sufficient to cover all school costs, such as 
educational materials, and failed to provide 
incentives for the poorest families to send girls 
to school (Ridley and Bista, 2004).

Furthermore, while attempting to redress 
disparities in access, scholarships and stipends 
may lead to other forms of gender inequity. 
A primary education stipend programme in 
Bangladesh had a negative impact on grade 
progression for boys from poor households, who 
were ineligible to receive the stipends available 
to girls at the secondary level (Baulch, 2011). 
In Pakistan, evidence shows that in families 
where girls are eligible for stipends restricted 
to government schools, boys are more likely 
to be enrolled in private schools, which often 
afford a better quality of education (Independent 
Evaluation Group, 2011a).

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 51025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportEarly marriage and adolescent pregnancy

Early entry into marriage and pregnancy limits 
adolescent girls’ access to and continuation 
in education. School attendance is often 
incompatible with the responsibilities and 
expectations of marriage and motherhood  
in many cultures (Mensch et al., 2005).  
The relationship between early marriage, 
child-bearing and girls’ education is complex, 
however. As the 2013/14 GMR noted, a strong 
body of evidence indicates girls’ participation 
in formal education is itself an important 
factor in delaying marriage and child-bearing 
(UNESCO, 2014c). Decisions about education, 
age of marriage and pregnancy can be a result 
of combined underlying factors, such as poverty, 
discriminatory social norms and household 
composition, as well as accessibility and quality 
of education provision (Psaki, 2015). Conflict 
and humanitarian crises also exacerbate girls’ 
vulnerability to early marriage (Lemmon, 2014).

Legislation on child marriage has been 
strengthened, but is not sufficient to eliminate 
the practice

International human rights law forbids child 
marriage. In the Programme of Action adopted 
at the 1994 International Conference on 
Population and Development, signatories agreed 
to enforce laws against child marriage. Regional 
treaties, including the African Charter on Human 
and Peoples’ Rights and the African Protocol 
on the Rights of Women (2004), also commit 
governments to prevent child marriage. Of 55 
developing countries with data, the legal age of 
marriage increased between 1990 and 2000 for 
women in 23 countries and for men in 20. As of 
2010, 158 countries had laws setting 18 as the 
legal age of marriage for girls without parental 
consent (Loaiza and Wong, 2012).

Progress towards eliminating child marriage 
globally has been slow. Household survey data 
for 2000–2011 indicated that in 41 countries, 30% 
or more of women aged 20 to 24 were married 
or in union by the age of 18 (Loaiza and Wong, 
2012). And there is insufficient evidence whether 
legislation alone is an effective deterrent to this 
practice (Psaki, 2015). In Bangladesh, where the 
prevalence of child marriage at an estimated  
66% is among the highest in the world, legislation 
limits the age of marriage to 18, although the law 

allows for exceptions (Brown, 2012; Loaiza and 
Wong, 2012). An evaluation of the 1974 National 
Marriage Act in Indonesia found no significant 
departure from the trend in child marriage 
following the act’s introduction (Lee-Rife et al., 
2012). In Yemen, a 2009 law set the minimum 
age for marriage at 17, but conservative 
parliament members and clerics objected and 
the law was not implemented (AlAmodi, 2013).

The incidence of child marriage has been 
reduced substantially in some countries, 
however, including Bolivia, Ethiopia and Nepal. 
In Ethiopia, where education attainment levels 
also improved, it is estimated that the prevalence 
of early marriage fell by over 20% between 2005 
and 2011 (Loaiza and Wong, 2012). This was 
achieved through a comprehensive framework 
of legislative change, advocacy and community 
mobilization campaigns (Box 5.2).

Box 5.2: Tackling child marriage in Ethiopia

In Ethiopia, it is currently estimated that 41% of women aged 
20 to 24 were married or in union before age 18. Advocacy 
campaigns, community mobilization and girls’ clubs have 
shown positive effects in tackling child marriage.

The Ethiopian Constitution of 1995 emphasizes the importance 
of addressing traditional attitudes and discrimination against 
women. This commitment was reinforced in additional policies 
and four education sector development programmes. The 2000 
Revised Family Proclamation set the legal age of marriage at 
18 for boys and girls. Uptake was slow, but by 2008, six of the 
nine regional governments had enacted corresponding laws. 

The Ministry of Women, Children and Youth Affairs is finalizing 
a policy on harmful traditional practices, including early 
marriage, and leading the national Alliance to End Child 
Marriage, formed in 2013. Government campaigns have been 
particularly prominent in the Amhara region, where rates of 
child marriage, although still extremely high, fell from 74% 
to 56% between 2005 and 2011. Documented community 
actions include fines imposed on families arranging underage 
marriages and school clubs reporting planned weddings.

NGOs have also played a role, albeit a smaller one. The 
Population Council’s Berhane Hewan programme, which 
combined community mobilization and financial incentives 
to delay marriage, found that participating girls aged 10 to 14 
were 3 times more likely to remain in school and 10 times less 
likely to marry in comparison with peers in a control group.

GOAL 5: GENDER PARITY AND EQUALITYIncreasing demand and supporting rights to educationAdolescent mothers face challenges in 
continuing their education

While adolescent pregnancy and early  
child-bearing is a concern for both developed 
and developing countries, rates are higher  
in middle and low income countries. In 2010,  
36.4 million women in developing countries  
aged 20 to 24 reported having given birth  
before age 18, and 2 million before age  
15 (UNFPA, 2013b).

An estimated 90% of adolescent pregnancies 
in the developing world are to girls who are 
married (UNFPA, 2013b). Married girls face 
higher exposure to sex and lower probability 
of using contraception than their unmarried 
peers, along with pressure to conceive quickly 
after marriage (Presler-Marshall and Jones, 
2012). Thus, reducing adolescent pregnancy 
can be addressed through effective policies 
and programmes to delay marriage. Globally, 
however, the risk of early and unintended 
pregnancy outside marriage has increased 
(Hindin and Fatusi, 2009; Mensch et al., 2006; 
Presler-Marshall and Jones, 2012). While the 
prevalence of child marriage declined in  
sub-Saharan Africa between 1994 and 2004, 
the prevalence of premarital sex before age 18 
increased in 19 out of 27 countries analysed 
(Mensch et al., 2006).

Pregnancy has been identified as a key driver 
of dropout and exclusion among female 
secondary school students in sub-Saharan 
African countries (Makamare, 2014), including 
Cameroon (Eloundou-Enyegue, 2004) and South 
Africa (Geisler et al., 2009). In Latin American 
countries, the high rate of pregnancy among 
adolescents is a serious concern for public 
policy. In Chile, being a mother reduces the 
likelihood of secondary education completion by 
24% to 37% (Kruger et al., 2009). 

Since the late 1990s, several sub-Saharan 
African countries have introduced policies 
supporting the readmission of girls following 
the birth of a child (Makamare, 2014). But even 
where policies exist, uptake is often limited, with 
education providers and communities unaware 
of re-entry policies or unsupportive of girls’ 
return. In schools, stigma and discrimination 
against pregnant girls and adolescent mothers 
are common (UNESCO, 2014b). In South Africa, 

legislation forbids schools from excluding 
pregnant girls, but only about one in three return 
after childbirth. Those who do return often face 
negative attitudes and practices from teachers 
and peers (Bhana et al., 2010).

Alternative education can support out-of-school 
adolescent mothers. Non-formal second-chance 
programmes in Angola and Malawi have created 
opportunities for adolescent mothers to attend 
classes by allowing them to bring their children 
with them (Jere, 2012; Save the Children, 2012). 
In Jamaica, a government-funded programme 
provided continuing education to adolescent 
mothers who, until a change in legislation 
in 2013, were excluded from school when 
pregnant. The programme has been effective 
in reintegrating girls into formal education 
and reducing further pregnancies (UNFPA, 
2013a, 2013b).

Programmes working directly with young 
people have positive effects

Programmes working directly with girls are 
particularly successful (Lee-Rife et al., 2012)  
The Abriendo Oportunidades project for 
indigenous girls in Guatemala had reached  
3,500 girls by 2011 and had a positive impact.  
A 2010 evaluation found that all participants  
had completed sixth grade, compared with less 
than 82% of their peers nationally, and that  
97% remained childless during the programme, 
compared with 78% of non-participants (Catino 
et al., 2013).

In Kenya, Uganda, the United Republic of 
Tanzania and Zambia, the Young Men as  
Equal Partners project (2005–2009) worked  
with teachers, community leaders, health  
service providers and peer educators to 
encourage young men and women aged  
10 to 24 to engage in responsible sexual 
behaviour, and to strengthen gender equality 
in decision-making regarding sexual and 
reproductive health. Activities included sexuality 
education, gender awareness training, provision 
of youth-friendly health services, counselling 
and condom distribution (RFSU, 2009). 
Pregnancy rates in targeted areas fell during  
the project period. In Kenya, it was reported  
that pregnancies in targeted schools dropped 
from 1 in 29 girls in 2006 to 1 in 97 girls in  
2009 (RFSU, 2011).

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 51025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportExpanding and improving 
school infrastructure

The goals of gender parity and equality have also 
been both directly and indirectly supported by 
policies to increase the availability and adequacy 
of school infrastructure. Increasing the supply 
of schools, including girls-only schools, and 
improving school facilities can, in some contexts, 
have a disproportionate benefit for girls. This 
section examines the impact of increased 
availability and accessibility of schools, as well 
as water and sanitation, as strategies to improve 
girls’ attendance at school.

Reducing distances to school

Girls’ enrolment and attendance are  
particularly sensitive to distances to school.  
This is especially true in contexts where  
parents are concerned for girls’ security to 
and from school, such as slums in Nairobi 
(Mudege et al., 2008), or where traditional 
gendered seclusion practices are in place, such 
as Pakistan (Andrabi et al., 2007; Jacoby and 
Mansuri, 2011). In Chad, a study of 179 villages 
in 2002–2003 found that children’s enrolment 
dropped dramatically when schools were in 
a village other than their own, and that as 
distances increased, girls’ enrolment fell  
more quickly than boys’ (Lehman, 2003).

Building schools in underserved communities 
has helped overcome barriers to girls’ education 
related to distance. A study in Ghor province 
in Afghanistan, where villages were randomly 
selected to receive a primary school building, 
found that overall enrolment increased by 42 
percentage points and that girls’ enrolment 
increased by 17 percentage points more than 
that of boys, eliminating an existing gender gap 
(Burde and Linden, 2012).

Policy measures increasing the availability  
of schools can result in greater enrolment  
gains for girls (Glick, 2008). In Egypt, the 
Education Enhancement Programme,  
initiated in the late 1990s, included massive 
investment in new schools, targeting deprived 
rural areas, where girls’ enrolment was 
traditionally low. It made significant progress 
in raising the primary enrolment ratios of girls 
and reducing the enrolment gap with boys 

(Iqbal and Riad, 2004). In 1990, 84 girls for every 
100 boys were enrolled in primary education 
in Egypt. The figure rose to 92 in 1999 and had 
reached 96 by 2012.

Governments facing declining school-age 
populations have made policy decisions to 
reduce the numbers of schools in remote areas. 
Such decisions need to be considered in light 
of their unintended effects on gender disparity. 
In China, where fewer girls than boys achieve 
a secondary education, a policy to merge rural 
primary schools reduced the numbers of rural 
schools from 440,000 in 2000 to 253,000 in 2008. 
However, a study of 102 rural communities in 
7 provinces found that the presence of a local 
primary school increased girls’ completion of 
lower secondary by 17 percentage points (Li 
and Liu, 2014).

The availability of post-primary schools can 
influence the effectiveness of other strategies 
to improve gender parity at primary and 
secondary levels (Unterhalter et al., 2014). A 
longitudinal study in Pakistan found a strong 
positive relationship between the availability of 
post-primary schooling and girls’ retention in 
primary school (Lloyd and Young, 2009). And in 
Bangladesh, where stipends for girls have driven 
enormous growth in secondary enrolment, the 
government’s action a decade earlier to bring 
Islamic schools into the formal sector increased 
the availability of places (Asadullah and 
Chaudhury, 2009). 

Improving water and sanitation facilities

The Dakar Framework for Action highlights 
the provision of safe and separate sanitation 
facilities for girls as a key strategy in improving 
school attendance for girls and promoting more 
equitable school environments. Also launched in 
Dakar, a task force called Focusing Resources on 
Effective School Health advocated for adequate 
water, hygiene and toilet facilities in schools 
as particularly relevant to girls (Joerger and 
Hoffmann, 2002). In recent years, the WASH in 
Schools global partnership has continued to 
champion these efforts. Critical to the push for 
improved sanitation has been the understanding 
that adolescent girls’ concerns over privacy, 
particularly during menstruation, influence their 
education decisions and can act as an obstacle 
to school attendance (Adukia, 2014).

GOAL 5: GENDER PARITY AND EQUALITYExpanding and improving school infrastructureSchool water and sanitation provision in many 
developing countries has improved over the 
past decade, but progress has been slow: of 
126 countries with data, the average percentage 
of primary schools with adequate sanitation 
coverage rose from 59% in 2008 to 68% in 
2012; in 52 of the least developed and other low 
income countries, the share rose from 35% to 
50% (UNICEF, 2013g).

In a study for the 2010 GMR, a review of 44 
national education plans for developing and 
transition countries from 2005 to 2009 found 
that 25 included strategies to improve water 
and sanitation in schools, with 11 specifically 
linked to gender-related objectives. Initiatives 
included building separate latrines for girls and 
boys (UNESCO-IIEP, 2009). In 2012, 60% of the 
funds in the Punjab Education Sector Reforms 
Programme in Pakistan were earmarked 
for improving facilities in girls’ schools, 
with provision of toilets a top priority (ASER 
Pakistan, 2014).

Data are limited on the extent of separate 
facilities for girls and whether they are well 
maintained or even functional. Government 
monitoring of minimum standards often deals 
only with basic coverage indicators. Funding 
from international agencies to improve data 
collection has highlighted continued poor 
conditions, in some cases prompting government 
response. In the United Republic of Tanzania, 
school census data showed that, as of 2010, 
all primary and lower secondary schools had 
single-sex latrines. Yet a 2010 mapping exercise 
by SNV, WaterAid and UNICEF found that only 
11% of schools surveyed met the minimum 
standards of 20 students per girls’ latrine and 
25 per boys’ latrine, 52% of girls’ latrines lacked 
doors, and 92% of schools lacked functional 
handwashing facilities (SNV/WaterAid/UNICEF, 
2010). This information led to the development of 
an integrated national strategic plan to improve 
water and sanitation facilities in schools, which 
included key objectives addressing the specific 
needs of adolescent girls (United Republic of 
Tanzania Ministry of Education and Vocational 
Training, 2012).

Surprisingly little evidence is available on the 
impact of single-sex toilets on girls’ enrolment 
and completion, and how effective they are as a 
stand-alone strategy to improve girls’ attendance 
(Birdthistle et al., 2011). Available evidence 
presents a mixed picture. Evidence from Kenya 
indicates that the quality of primary school 
toilets, in terms of cleanliness and maintenance, 
may be more important than quantity in 
improving attendance (Dreibelbis et al., 2013). 
In Malawi, a longitudinal study of adolescents 
found no association between single-sex 
toilet availability and girls’ school attendance. 
Furthermore, menstruation accounted for 
only a small proportion of girls’ absenteeism, 
insufficient to create a gender gap in attendance 
(Grant et al., 2013).

In India, however, after a school latrine 
construction effort in the early 2000s, girls’ 
enrolment increased more than that of boys’ in 
schools with latrines. At younger ages, girls and 
boys both benefited substantially from latrines, 
whether sex-specific or not, but separate 
latrines were a critical factor in adolescent girls’ 
enrolment, which increased substantially after 
separate latrines were installed. This differential 
impact on older girls suggests that privacy and 
menstruation issues may indeed be a key factor 
in girls’ attendance in India. The construction 
of single-sex toilets also had a positive impact 
on the share of female teachers at schools, 
suggesting another possible route by which girls 
can benefit (Adukia, 2014).

More research is needed to assess the impact 
of toilet availability within interventions that 
combine infrastructure with training, outreach 
and hygiene education, including menstrual 
hygiene management. Whether a significant 
factor in girls’ attainment or not, access to  
better facilities and support is likely to have 
positive effects on girls’ dignity and the overall 
quality of their school experience (Unterhalter 
et al., 2014).

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 51025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportPolicies to improve boys’ 
participation are also needed

The needs of millions of boys around the world are 
not adequately met by formal education systems, 
a fact sometimes overlooked in light of the overall 
disproportionate disadvantage girls continue to 
face. While girls remain less likely than boys to 
enter school in the first place, in many countries 
boys are at higher risk of failing to progress and 
complete a cycle of education. It is important 
to note that a disadvantage for boys does not 
necessarily transpose to an advantage for girls. 
Distinct policies for girls and boys are needed to 
support the enrolment and completion of both.

In addition to human rights implications for boys 
who, for whatever reason, suffer from inadequate 
access to education, high dropout rates among 
boys have broader repercussions for gender 
relations. Research from the International Men 
and Gender Equality Survey, conducted in 2009 
and 2010 in Brazil, Chile, Croatia, India, Mexico 
and Rwanda, found that men with less education 
expressed discriminatory gender views, were 
more likely to be violent in the home and were 
less likely to be involved in child care if they 
were fathers. Men with secondary education 
demonstrated more gender-equitable attitudes 
and practices (Barker et al., 2011).

Several factors increase boys’ risk of 
leaving school

Significant numbers of boys leave school early 
due to poverty and the obligation or desire to 
work (Barker et al., 2012), often combined with 
late entry, poor performance and a subsequent 
lack of interest in school, as well as factors such 
as ethnicity and other forms of marginalization 
(Hunt, 2008; Jha et al., 2012).

In southern African countries, including 
Botswana, Lesotho and Namibia, boys are taken 
out of school to herd cattle (Jha and Kelleher, 
2006). In Mongolia, boys in poor herder families 
have historically experienced high rates of 
dropout and continue to be the most educationally 
disadvantaged rural group (Steiner-Khamsi  
and Gerebnaa, 2008). In Brazil and Jamaica, 
boys in low income urban settings often drop 
out to work in manual labour, construction 
or other semi-skilled jobs that do not require 
completion of secondary education because they 

see education as offering no guarantee of future 
employment (Barker et al., 2012).

Boys from poorer households or minority 
groups are often at higher risk of dropout. 
Families may respond to economic shocks by 
withdrawing boys from school to work. In Brazil, 
the likelihood of boys from poor households 
dropping out of school following a sudden 
fall in family income was 46% higher than for 
boys from non-poor households (Duryea et 
al., 2007). Economic hardship also enhances 
susceptibility to gang membership and violence, 
often underpinned by a lack of educated male 
role models and perceptions of schooling as 
unmanly, for example in the Caribbean (Barker 
et al., 2012; Smith and Green, 2007). In OECD 
countries, boys frequently leave school because 
of poor academic performance throughout 
their schooling, with those from low income 
backgrounds or minority groups at the highest 
risk (OECD, 2012c).

Gender stereotyping and entrenched violence 
in schools compound the problem. Boys are 
often perceived as tough and undisciplined, 
and consequently are more likely to experience 
corporal punishment than girls. A recent case study 
in Mongolia links the higher likelihood of violence 
against boys in schools with increased likelihood of 
dropout, especially for those boys from low income 
and migrant families already disadvantaged by 
economic pressures (Hepworth, 2013). 

Policies to address boys’ school leaving  
are limited

Developing countries’ education policies often 
pay little attention to improving boys’ enrolment 
in and completion of primary or secondary 
education, even in countries with severe gender 
disparity at boys’ expense (Jha et al., 2012). For 
example, no strategies to reduce the gender 
gap and tackle barriers to boys’ attainment 
are evident in policy documents in Lesotho or 
Swaziland (Lesotho Ministry of Education, 2002; 
Swaziland Ministry of Education and Training, 
2011). Yet Lesotho’s extreme gender disparity 
at the secondary level, with more than 140 girls 
enrolled for every 100 boys, is largely unchanged 
since 1999. In the Philippines and Thailand, 
where disparity in enrolment at the expense of 
boys emerges in secondary education, gender 
equality mechanisms and policies focus largely 
on women and girls (Hepworth, 2013).

Developing 
countries’ 
education 
policies often 
overlook boys’ 
enrolment and 
completion 

173

GOAL 5: GENDER PARITY AND EQUALITYPolicies to improve boys’ participation are also neededMongolia, where the gender gap at the expense 
of boys in secondary enrolment has been 
reduced substantially since 1999, provides a 
rare example of policy supporting boys’ access 
to education. Government policy issued in 2004 
explicitly targeted high male dropout rates. 
However, this appears to have been reversed in 
the most recent education action plan, which 
makes no specific reference to boys or other 
disadvantaged groups (Hepworth, 2013).

In Jamaica, a government programme providing 
education grants to vulnerable households 
introduced higher payments for boys enrolled in 
secondary school as a response to boys’ lower 
attainment, thus benefiting boys from poorer 
households who are at greater risk of leaving 
school (Fiszbein and Schady, 2009). Through 
regional conferences, Caribbean countries 
have been active in sharing strategies and 
interventions such as mentoring, second-chance 
initiatives, training and community dialogue that 
are aimed at responding to school dropout (World 
Bank and Commonwealth Secretariat, 2009).

Equitable school and  
classroom environments

Gender equality in education requires not only 
equality of access, but also equality in the 
learning process, in educational outcomes 
and in external results. The Dakar Framework 
highlights school-related factors that can 
constrain the achievement of equality and calls 
for schools to be safe and gender-sensitive 
learning environments.

The 2008 GMR identified three sets of 
provisions essential to improving the quality of 
learning in schools in general, but for girls in 
particular: enhancing the number and quality of 
teachers, including female teachers; reforming 
curricula and textbooks to remove gender 
bias; and making classroom practices more 
gender-sensitive through training (UNESCO, 
2008b). Recent years have seen a growing 
focus on gender-based violence in the wider 
school environment.

Recruiting female teachers

The proportion of female teachers is an 
important indicator of progress towards gender 
equality. Increasing the presence of female 
teachers has been shown to have a positive 
effect in countries where girls face disadvantage 
in participation in education. 

Globally, the share of women in the primary 
teaching force has increased since 1999, from 
58% to 63% in 2012. They are a substantial 
majority in many countries, particularly in 
Central Asia, Central and Eastern Europe, 
and North America and Western Europe. In 
secondary education, the global average remains 
unchanged at 52%. In several countries in the 
Arab States, South and West Asia and much of 
sub-Saharan Africa, female teachers remain in 
the minority at both the primary and secondary 
levels. Overall, women made up 43% of primary 
teachers in sub-Saharan Africa in 2012 and 31% 
of secondary teachers.

In countries including Afghanistan, Benin, 
Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Morocco, Mozambique, 
Nepal and Niger, recruitment of female teachers 
has been a prominent strategy in national 
education plans over the past decade, linked to 
strategies to encourage girls’ enrolment and 
retention (UNESCO-IIEP, 2009). In Afghanistan, 
where conservative communities do not allow 
girls to be taught by men, two national plans 
have included clear targets on female teacher 
recruitment to address low levels of girls’ 
enrolment. These included strategies to increase 
the number of female primary and secondary 
teachers by 50% by 2010 (Afghanstan Ministry 
of Education, 2007) and to recruit and train 
50,000 grade 12 graduates, of whom 45% were 
to be women (Afghanstan Ministry of Education, 
2014). Between 1999 and 2012, the percentage 
of female teachers in Afghanistan rose from an 
extremely low 10% to 31% in primary education.

Over the same period, substantial progress was 
made towards achieving a gender balance in the 
teaching force in several countries where women 
were a minority. In Nepal, which had explicit 
policies for female recruitment, the share of

174

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 51025Education for All Global Monitoring Reportfemale primary teachers rose from 23% in 1999 
to 42% in 2012. Similarly in Morocco, the share 
rose from 39% to 54% (Figure 5.8). 

The proportion of women among new entrants 
into primary teaching in countries including 
Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Mozambique 
and Nepal reflects genuine effort: they now 
make up a majority of new teachers. On average 
between 2009 and 2012, 60% of new teachers 
in Nepal and 62% in Mozambique were women. 
With more women entering the profession, the 
chance of achieving gender balance among 
primary teachers by 2015 is greatly improved.

By contrast, in Ethiopia, strategies to increase 
the proportion of women in primary teaching are 
unlikely to be sustained unless action is taken to 
boost the share of new teachers who are women, 
which averaged 28% between 2009 and 2012.

In countries where a large majority of 
primary teachers are women, patterns of 
new recruitment over the period continued to 
favour them. They accounted for 87% of all new 

teachers in France and Germany, although the 
proportion was notably lower in some countries, 
such as the Czech Republic and Ukraine. In 
contrast, in Brazil, less than half of new teachers 
were women (Figure 5.8).

Female representation in the teaching force 
falls as the level of education rises. On average 
across OECD countries, two-thirds of teachers 
are women, but the proportion decreases as the 
level of education increases: from 97% at the 
pre-primary level to 82% at the primary level, 
68% at the lower secondary level and 56% at the 
upper secondary level (OECD, 2013a). 

In Ghana, where gender gaps in secondary 
enrolment remain despite achieving parity at 
the primary level, women made up less than 
one-quarter of secondary teaching staff in 2013. 
In Central African Republic, Chad, Guinea and 
Mali, which have severe gender disparities in 
education, less than 12% of secondary teachers 
were women in 2012, denying adolescent girls 
important role models.

of new entrants in several countries

GOAL 5: GENDER PARITY AND EQUALITYEquitable school and classroom environmentsIncreasing influence by non-state providers 
has been an important international trend in 
teacher recruitment. Growth in non-formal 
schooling and private provision has expanded 
female recruitment. In low income countries 
where women’s mobility has traditionally been 
restricted, this has produced alternative routes 
for women to become teachers, particularly 
in rural areas. In Afghanistan, the NGO BRAC 
hired mainly married women recruited locally 
and trained them to teach lower primary 
grades (Anwar and Islam, 2013). In Pakistan, 
low-fee private primary schools employ young, 
untrained, unmarried women from local 
communities (Andrabi et al., 2008). But issues 
of gender equality remain a concern. A recent 
study in Jordan, where women represent 88% 
of the workforce in private schools, found that 
female teachers employed in private schools 
earned 42% less than their male counterparts 
(ILO, 2013c).

Leadership opportunities for female teachers

A considerable bias in favour of promoting male 
teachers to school managerial positions was 
shown in data from 12 countries surveyed in 
the Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium 
for Monitoring Educational Quality (SACMEQ) III 
project. In Kenya and the United Republic 
of Tanzania, while almost half of all primary 
teachers were female, women made up less than 
20% of school principals (UNESCO-IIEP, 2011). 
Even where a majority of teachers are women, 
proportionally fewer women than men ascend 
to leadership positions. In OECD countries, men 
are more likely to be school principals than be 
regular teachers. In Portugal and the Republic 
of Korea, less than one-third of regular lower 
secondary teachers are male, but men make up 
61% and 87%, respectively, of school principals 
(OECD, 2014l).

The impact of teacher gender

The presence of female teachers can allay 
parents’ fears of security issues and help 
increase demand for girls’ schooling, particularly 
in countries where cultural and social barriers 
to girls’ enrolment exist. A study in 30 developing 
countries found that increasing the proportion 
of female teachers in a district increased girls’ 
access and retention in education, particularly 
in rural areas (Huisman and Smits, 2009a; 

Huisman and Smits, 2009b). In some contexts, 
recruitment of female teachers can have a 
beneficial effect on girls’ performance and 
continuation in secondary education (Aslam 
and Kingdon, 2007; UIS, 2010). In Tunisia, 
where gender parity in primary enrolment was 
achieved in 2012, the greater numbers of female 
teachers in schools in recent years was positively 
associated both with girls’ grade averages and 
scores on primary school leaving examinations 
(Baliamoune, 2011; Lockheed and Mete, 2007).

A study in five Indian states found that while 
female teachers were more likely than male 
teachers to view all children as equally capable 
of learning, recent training received by teachers 
was a more important factor than teacher 
gender for student achievement (Chudgar and 
Sankar, 2008). Other studies have shown that 
factors of similarity between teachers and 
students, such as ethnicity, caste and religion, 
can be as important for learning outcomes as 
gender is, if not more so, particularly for boys 
(Rawal and Kingdon, 2010). Student concerns 
about teachers may relate more to individual 
teachers’ abilities than to whether they are 
female or male, as was found in the United 
Kingdom (Francis et al., 2008).

Research has failed to find any causal link 
between boys’ underachievement or low 
participation in school and the gender of their 
teacher (Kelleher, 2011). Wider gender norms, 
however, can lead to some boys disengaging 
from school and dropping out (Cobbett and 
Younger, 2012; Kelleher, 2011).

Gender-sensitive training for 
classroom practice

Teachers play a critical part in forming students’ 
understanding of gender roles. Teachers’ 
attitudes, practices and differential expectations 
of boys and girls in class can reproduce 
gender stereotypes and affect girls’ and boys’ 
motivation, participation and learning outcomes. 
In many settings, classroom observations show 
teachers of both sexes interacting more often 
with boys, thus encouraging passivity among 
girls (Eurydice, 2010). Research in the Republic 
of Korea found male students dominating 
interactions with teachers by being called on 
more often by teachers or calling out in class 
(Jung and Chung, 2006).

The presence 
of female 
teachers can 
allay parents’ 
fears of security 
issues and 
help increase 
demand for 
girls’ schooling

176

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 51025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportInitial and ongoing teacher education regarding 
inclusion, gender-sensitive pedagogy and 
classroom management can reduce teacher 
bias and build more supportive school 
environments. Gender-sensitive training that 
equips teachers to improve diversity in teaching 
and assessment styles can help ensure that girls 
and boys participate equally in class (Postles, 
2013). Research indicates learner-centred, 
collaborative teaching methods can help improve 
learning for both boys and girls (Jha et al., 2012; 
Oloyede et al., 2012).

Integrating gender-sensitive training into 
teacher education

Before 2000, education reform relating to 
classroom practice tended to concentrate on 
improving teaching methods for subject-related 
student performance. Relatively little attention 
was paid to gender-sensitive training, even in 
countries that made efforts to address gender 
inequality more widely, such as Belgium, France 
and Switzerland (Baudino, 2007).

Change has been slow. A 2010 review found 
that gender-sensitive teaching as a class 
management tool had been implemented in 
about one-third of European countries (Eurydice, 
2010). A separate review of education policy in 
40 developing countries indicated that policies to 
integrate gender training into teacher education 
remained scarce (Hunt, 2013).

Gender-sensitive training in developing countries 
has been largely funded by donors or international 
NGOs, either as add-on programmes or as 
part of wider sector reforms. The Gender-
Responsive Pedagogy model is an example 
of a well-established add-on training model. 
Developed by the Forum for African Women 
Educationalists, training has reached over 6,600 
teachers since 2005 (FAWE, 2013). In Indonesia, 
under the USAID-supported Decentralized Basic 
Education reform, gender-sensitive training was 
introduced as a strategy to improve the quality of 
education (USAID, 2008). The Commonwealth of 
Learning, in partnership with UNICEF, supports 
mainstreaming of gender-sensitive, child-friendly 
schooling approaches in pre-service and  
in-service teacher education in Botswana, 
Lesotho, Malawi, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, 
Sri Lanka, Swaziland, Trinidad and Tobago, and 
Zambia (Umar et al., 2012).

Some governments have made efforts to include 
gender training in formal teacher education 
policy and programmes. A 12 month certificate 
of education course for teachers in Bangladesh 
includes a unit on gender issues, which gives 
teachers ways to explore their own practice and 
develop more inclusive approaches (Heijnen-
Maathuis, 2008). Kenya’s Education Sector 
Support Programme 2005–2010 included explicit 
strategies for gender-sensitive teacher training 
(Kenya Government, 2005). Mexico’s 2013–2018 
national education plan promotes a gender-
sensitive approach to teacher education (Mexico 
Government, 2007); in-service programmes 
can support gender-sensitive classroom 
practices, but are optional. Papua New Guinea’s 
2009–2014 Gender Equity Strategic Plan calls 
for gender equity to inform all pre-service and 
in-service teacher education (Papua New Guinea 
Department of Education, 2009).

Even where such policies exist, however, a 
lack of clear strategies, poor implementation 
and supervision, and inadequate evaluation of 
outcomes frequently limit their effectiveness, as 
in Cameroon (Box 5.3). In addition, there is still 
a lack of knowledge about the extent to which 
teachers and teacher trainers draw on training 
in gender issues and how learners respond to it 
(Unterhalter et al., 2014).

Policies to 
integrate 
gender training 
into teacher 
education 
remain scarce 

Box 5.3: Greater efforts to implement policy on 
gender-sensitive training are needed in Cameroon

Cameroon’s 2006–2015 Education Sector Strategy and 2010–2020 
Growth and Employment Strategy Paper refer to implementation  
of teaching approaches that are sensitive to gender through initial 
and ongoing primary and secondary teacher training, along with 
gender training for school managers and advisers. However, 
research conducted in 2012, involving 313 stakeholders and 109 
teachers from 10 primary and secondary schools in 4 regions, 
highlights the gap between policy and practice. During discussions, 
teachers demonstrated a lack of awareness of, or unfamiliarity 
with, gender-responsive pedagogy. In spite of the government 
policies, they reported that gender issues had figured in training 
only informally, such as during discussions about other aspects 
of teaching. Furthermore, stereotypical views of gender among 
teachers were common, curriculum materials did not promote 
gender equality and high pupil/teacher ratios impeded the use of  
a diversity of teaching methods.

GOAL 5: GENDER PARITY AND EQUALITYEquitable school and classroom environmentsCurriculum and textbook reform to promote 
gender equality

In the classroom, gender-responsive teaching 
is guided not only by pedagogic approaches but 
also by curriculum content, textbooks and other 
learning materials, which serve as vehicles for 
socialization (Brugeilles and Cromer, 2009). 
Schools can be a powerful entry point for 
promoting equitable gender relations and diverse 
possibilities for male and female roles. Curricula 
can encourage children to question gender 
stereotypes and promote equitable behaviour. 
Conversely, discriminatory gender norms 
conveyed in textbooks can damage children’s 
self-esteem, lower their engagement and limit 
their expectations (Esplen, 2009). The Dakar 
Framework of Action highlights the need for 
learning content and materials to encourage and 
support equality and respect between genders. 
In 2010, UNGEI reiterated the importance of 
eliminating gender bias in school teaching and 
learning materials and called for greater attention 
to this policy issue (UNGEI, 2010).

Eliminating gender bias in textbooks

Gender bias is rife in textbooks. Despite prior 
widespread revisions, textbooks worldwide around 
2000 continued to show distinct patterns of gender 
bias: females were often under-represented or 
absent, and depictions of males and females in 
both the professional and domestic spheres relied 
on traditional gender stereotypes (Blumberg, 
2007). Women were depicted in half as many 
images as men in Spanish language and literature 
textbooks (González and Entonado, 2004). Social 
studies texts used in China in 2000 showed all 
scientists as male (Yi, 2002).

The EFA movement provided new impetus for 
donors and governments to address gender 
bias in education. One of three strategies 
in Pakistan’s 2001–2015 EFA action plan to 
improve gender parity and equality was a call 
for curricula and textbooks to be free of gender 
bias (Mirza, 2004). International agencies have 
promoted policies and initiatives to tackle gender 
bias in textbooks in low income countries. 
Between 1998 and 2005, the World Bank shifted 
the focus of its expenditure on girls’ education 
interventions towards improving the quality of 
educational resources, including eliminating 
gender bias. Several large education initiatives 

– including in Bangladesh, Chad, Ghana, Guinea 
and Nepal – had explicit components aimed 
at eliminating gender bias from curricula and/
or textbooks (Blumberg, 2007). UNESCO has 
funded gender audits of textbooks, including 
in Jordan (Alayan and Al-Khalidi, 2010) and 
Pakistan (Mirza, 2004). In China, the Ford 
Foundation funded research to investigate 
gender bias in textbooks and supported the 
development of education plans, activities and 
reference materials to promote gender equality 
(Blumberg, 2007).

Recent studies show, however, that despite 
attempts to provide greater gender balance, bias 
in textbooks remains pervasive in many countries, 
including Georgia, the Islamic Republic of Iran, 
Nigeria and Pakistan (Asatoorian et al., 2011; 
Foroutan, 2012; Mustapha, 2012; Shah, 2012) and 
some high income countries such as Australia 
(Lee and Collins, 2009). A lack of political will and 
support within wider society limits enactment 
of policy reform to eliminate gender bias in 
education resources. In some instances, policy 
recommendations from the global level have 
failed to find sufficient national support, resulting 
in slow progress. While the findings of the Ford 
Foundation research were widely disseminated 
in China, some stakeholders were sceptical 
about the importance of advocating for change 
(Blumberg, 2007). In Pakistan, resistance within 
institutions responsible for curriculum reform 
and textbook production has contributed to the 
low political priority given to textbook revision, 
reinforced by a lack of public support (Blumberg, 
2015). Another challenge, as found in Georgia, is 
that key professionals responsible for providing 
guidelines for textbook production and approving 
textbooks for use lack adequate knowledge 
regarding gender sensitivity (Asatoorian et al., 
2011; Blumberg, 2007).

Inclusion of gender in curricula

Gender reviews of curricula have helped raise 
awareness and supported change towards more 
gender-responsive content and resources. In 
the United Republic of Tanzania, the national 
secondary school syllabuses, revised in 2010, 
contain gender-related topics. In civics, nearly 
25% of form 2 lessons are devoted to gender; 
form 4 includes gender in the study of culture; 
and the 2010 civics exam included questions on 
gender inequality (Miske, 2013).

Despite 
attempts 
to provide 
greater gender 
balance, bias 
in textbooks 
remains 
pervasive 
in many 
countries 

178

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 51025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportGender-responsive curricula that develop 
transferable skills have potential to support 
learning and promote positive gender relations. 
Gender Equity Movement in Schools, a project in 
Mumbai, India, developed an add-on curriculum 
including content on gender roles, violence, 
and sexual and reproductive health for standard 
6 and 7 children. Graduates demonstrated 
greater problem-solving skills and self-
confidence, alongside improved attitudes and 
gender awareness (Achyut et al., 2011). An 
interdisciplinary curriculum developed for the 
Sistema de Aprendizaje Tutorial, a secondary 
school programme for rural girls in Honduras 
including those who are indigenous, uses 
student-centred and inquiry-based learning 
that emphasizes dialogue. Its content questions 
dominant power structures and challenges 
gender stereotypes (Miske, 2013).

Comprehensive sex education is a critical 
curriculum area for promoting greater gender 
equality. Yet sex education programmes may 
fail to deal with the gender dynamics that 
accompany sexual and reproductive health 
(Stromquist, 2007). Inadequate treatment of 
human rights and gender equality in curricula 
has been identified as a problem in educational 
responses to HIV (UNAIDS Inter-agency Task 
Team on Education, 2006). A review of school 
sex education curricula in 10 countries in 
eastern and southern Africa showed all but 
2 had moderate to serious gaps in topics 
relating to gender. Discussion of gender-based 
violence was overlooked in many curricula, 
and the overall approach to gender was 
considered weak and sometimes contradictory 
(UNICEF, 2013b). Sweden, by contrast, has 
a long established curriculum that teaches 
sexuality in the context of its psychological, 
ethical and social dimensions and personal 
relationships, and supports equally sharing 
of sexual decision-making by girls and boys 
(Stromquist, 2007).

Tackling gender-based violence in schools

The Dakar Framework for Action calls on 
governments to make comprehensive efforts 
to eliminate gender bias and discrimination. 
It requires stakeholders to ensure students’ 
personal security, and notes girls are especially 
vulnerable to abuse and harassment, both at 
school and on the journey there and back.

School-related gender-based violence is 
defined as acts or threats of sexual, physical 
or psychological violence occurring in and 
around schools and educational settings as a 
result of gender norms and stereotypes and 
unequal power dynamics (Greene et al., 2013). It 
includes, but is not limited to, threats or acts of 
physical violence and bullying, non-consensual 
touching, sexual harassment, assault and rape 
(Leach et al., 2014). It also refers to differences 
between girls’ and boys’ experiences of violence 
in school settings, such as corporal punishment 
(Humphreys, 2008).

Often boys are more likely to experience frequent 
and severe physical violence, while girls are 
more often subject to sexual harassment and 
abuse, perpetrated to varying degrees by male 
students and teachers (Pinheiro, 2006; UNICEF, 
2014c). Yet these distinctions are not clear-
cut; girls also commit violent acts (Bhana, 
2008) and boys also experience sexual abuse 
(Nandita et al., 2014). Homophobic bullying and 
harassment and cyberbullying2 are increasingly 
being recognized as areas of concern (Fancy and 
Fraser, 2014; UNESCO, 2012a).

School-related gender-based violence is more 
and more a global concern

School-related gender-based violence is 
one of the worst manifestations of gender 
discrimination and seriously undermines 
attempts to achieve gender equality in education 
(Leach et al., 2012). Gender-based violence 
has short- and long-term consequences for 
both boys and girls. In addition to physical 
and psychological trauma, gender-based 
violence has long-lasting health and social 
consequences. Unsafe and violent school 
experiences have been shown to have a negative 
impact on boys’ and girls’ achievement and 
attainment (Mullis et al., 2012; UNESCO, 2008b).

Since 2000, a growing body of research has 
emerged of widespread gender-based violence 
in school settings, much of it focused on sexual 
violence against girls and predominantly in 
sub-Saharan Africa (Burton, 2005; Dunne et 
al., 2005; Human Rights Watch, 2001; Leach et 
al., 2003; Parkes and Heslop, 2013). There is

homosexuality of the victim. Cyberbullying refers to bullying using the 
internet or mobile devices.

GOAL 5: GENDER PARITY AND EQUALITYEquitable school and classroom environmentsevidence that sexual violence is entrenched 
in authoritarian and highly gendered school 
environments (Dunne et al., 2005). Older male 
students take advantage of their position to 
abuse female students. In Cameroon, 30% of 
sexual violence experienced by girls going to 
school was committed by male students (Devers 
et al., 2012). Teachers also commit sexual abuse 
and exploitation, often with impunity. In Malawi,  
20% of teachers surveyed reported being 
aware of colleagues forcing or coercing female 
students into sexual acts (Burton, 2005). In 
Sierra Leone, male teachers had perpetrated 
almost one-third of reported cases of girls being 
forced or coerced into sex in exchange for money, 
goods or grades (ACPF, 2010). 

In Latin America and the Caribbean, studies  
have largely focused on physical violence, 
including the spillover effects of gang violence 
in schools (Jones et al., 2008). Yet broad social 
tolerance for family and community violence, 
especially against women, provides the social 
context for sexual violence against girls by  
male students and teachers (Leach et al., 2014). 
A study concerning female adolescent victims  
of sexual violence in Ecuador found that  
37% of perpetrators were teachers (Jones et al., 
2008). Social taboos make researching gender-
based violence difficult in Asian countries and 
incidences of abuse are often unreported. 
Yet small-scale studies in South and West 
Asia report sexualized behaviour by teachers 
towards girls (Pawlak, 2014). Findings from a 
recent study of five countries in Asia highlight 
incidences of sexual violence against both boys 
and girls. In Viet Nam, 21% of girls and 17% of 
boys aged 12–17 reported experiencing sexual 
violence at school (Nandita et al., 2014). 

Physical violence, including corporal 
punishment, also has gendered dimensions 
(Parkes, 2015).  In Indonesia, 27% of boys aged 
12–17 reported having been physically punished 
by a teacher in the previous six months, 
compared with 9% of girls (Nandita et al., 2014). 
In Thailand, research found 56% of lesbian, gay, 
bisexual and transgender students had reported 
being bullied in the past month (UNESCO, 2014f).

Gender-based violence is not confined to poorer 
countries. At the time of Dakar, a survey of over 
2,000 secondary students across the United 
States revealed that over 80% had experienced 

sexual harassment at school (Harris Interactive, 
2001). A recent study in the Netherlands found 
27% of students had been sexually harassed by 
school personnel (Mncube and Harber, 2013). 
In countries such as Japan and New Zealand, 
access to online technology is driving new 
forms of school-related gender-based violence, 
including cyberbullying  (Pawlak, 2014).

Policy and programming responses to school-
related gender-based violence

Over the past decade, there has been a marked 
increase in policy and action to tackle violence in 
schools. The 2006 UN World Report on Violence 
Against Children documented violence against 
children – including in school settings – as a 
global phenomenon (Pinheiro, 2006); after its 
publication, there was an acceleration of global 
and regional initiatives to address this violence. 

Regional initiatives that specifically address 
gender-related violence include Plan 
International’s ‘Learn Without Fear’ campaign, 
launched in 2008, and the Council of Europe’s 
‘One in Five’ campaign, begun in 2010 (Leach 
et al., 2014).

Countries in sub-Saharan Africa have been at 
the forefront of policy development in recent 
years to tackle gender-based violence, especially 
sexual violence. Liberia, a country emerging 
from conflict, advocates the development of a 
syllabus on gender-based violence for use by 
trained educators in schools (Antonowicz, 2010). 
In South Africa, strategies to address gender-
based violence are supported by a strong legal 
and policy framework, and by guidelines for 
schools on preventing sexual harassment and 
abuse (Parkes, 2015).

In several sub-Saharan African countries, 
international NGOs have worked with 
governments to strengthen legislation and 
guidelines on tackling gender-based violence in 
schools (Parkes, 2015). The Kenyan government 
and ActionAid collaborated with teachers’ 
unions to draft a bill to reinforce mechanisms 
for reporting sexual violence and ensuring that 
guilty teachers are discharged, not transferred 
to other schools (Leach et al., 2014). In Ghana 
and Malawi, the Safe Schools project used 
national advocacy networks to lobby for 
revisions to the Teachers’ Code of Conduct and 

In Kenya, 
there are 
mechanisms 
for reporting 
sexual violence 
and ensuring 
that guilty 
teachers are

other schools 

180

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 51025Education for All Global Monitoring Reportto call for stronger enforcement of regulations 
relating to teacher misconduct (DevTech 
Systems, Inc., 2008).

Programmes promoting non-violence among 
men and boys, such as ReproSalud in Peru, 
demonstrate positive shifts in attitudes (OECD, 
2012a). In Brazil, India and the Balkans, Instituto 
Promundo and its partners have implemented 
promising programmes that use trained teacher 
and student facilitators to work with boys and 
young men from secondary schools to promote 
non-violence and reflect on gender norms 
(Barker et al., 2012). 

Girls clubs have the potential to address school-
related gender-based violence. An evaluation of 
ActionAid’s Stop Violence Against Girls in School 
project found that girls clubs had positive effects 
on girls’ knowledge, attitudes and practices in 
identifying violations and managing violence. 
Crucially, clubs worked with communities and 
schools to improve relationships among boys, 
girls, teachers, parents and other community 
members, and ensure that channels were in 
place to report incidences of discrimination 
and violence (Parkes and Heslop, 2013). In the 
United Republic of Tanzania, girls who had been 
members of clubs were more likely to report 
incidences of discrimination and violence than 
girls who had not (Unterhalter and Heslop, 2012).

Overall, however, there is little evidence that 
increased awareness of the prevalence of 
school-related gender-based violence over 
the last decade is translating into effective 
action to change behaviour and reduce levels 
of violence. Enforcement of laws is often poor, 
reporting and referral systems weak, and policy 
implementation patchy, partly because of deep-
seated social and gender norms at the district, 
community and school level (Parkes, 2015). In 
South Africa, for example, policy enactment 
has been limited (Bhana et al., 2009); a recent 
national survey found that 7.6% of girls had 
experienced severe assault or rape at secondary 
school (Burton and Leoschut, 2013).

Interventions are usually small, short-term 
projects that prove difficult to sustain and scale 
up. And there remains a lack of knowledge 
about what works in reducing the prevalence of 
gender-based violence in schools (Leach and 
Dunne, 2014). More research is also needed to 

understand how other factors – such as conflict 
(Kirk, 2007; UNESCO, 2011b) and disability 
(UNICEF, 2013e) – intersect with gender to 
exacerbate children’s vulnerability to violence. 
Research shows disabled children are less 
able to fend off attacks and are less likely to be 
believed when reporting incidences of violence 
(Jones et al., 2008).

Supporting equality in 
learning outcomes

Achieving gender equality in education requires 
not only that girls and boys have an equal chance 
to participate in education, but also that there 
are minimal disparities in outcomes, including 
those reflected by measures of achievement.

Learning assessments highlight gender 
differences in subject performance

Regional and international learning assessments 
at primary and secondary level, including PISA, 
TIMSS, SACMEQ and SERCE,3 indicate variation 
in subject-specific achievement by gender. 
Analysis presented in the 2012 GMR shows that 
girls overall performed better in reading, and that 
boys performed better in mathematics in most 
countries, although that gap was narrowing. 
Performance in science was more varied, with no 
significant difference between boys and girls in 
many countries (UNESCO, 2012b).

PISA surveys, which assess the performance of 
15-year-old students, show a widening gap in 
reading, with girls performing significantly better 
than boys in all locations surveyed (Figure 5.9A). 
A comparison of the subset of locations that  
took part in both the 2000 and 2012 surveys 
shows that the gender gap in reading widened in 
11 countries, including Bulgaria, France, Iceland, 
Israel, Portugal and Romania, largely due to a 
decline in boys’ performance. Low-performing 
boys face a particularly large disadvantage, as 
they are heavily over-represented among those 
who failed to show basic levels of reading literacy 
(OECD, 2013f).

in International Mathematics and Science Study, the survey by the Southern 
and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality and the 
Second Regional Comparative and Explanatory Study of the Latin American 
Laboratory for Assessment of the Quality of Education.

GOAL 5: GENDER PARITY AND EQUALITYSupporting equality in learning outcomesThe PISA results also show gender differences  
in mathematics, with boys performing better 
than girls in the majority of locations, although 
the gap has narrowed in several countries, 
including Montenegro, Norway and Slovakia 
(Figure 5.9B). In the 2012 PISA survey,  
girls in OECD countries underperformed  

boys by an average of 11 points. The data  
show that girls were under-represented 
among the highest achievers in most locations, 
a possible challenge to achieving equal 
participation in science, technology, engineering 
and mathematics occupations in the future 
(OECD, 2014f).

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 51025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportIn poorer settings, girls continue to face 
disadvantage in achievement

In some poorer countries where girls 
have historically faced barriers to equal 
participation in education, they continue to 
face disadvantage in obtaining important 
foundation skills. 

Gender disparities in learning can be 
underestimated when assessments only 
include children attending school. Analysis 
of the Annual Status of Education Report 
(ASER) 2014 Survey in rural Pakistan shows 
that gender gaps are small among grade 5 
students, sometimes favouring girls. However, 
girls’ relative performance is worse among 
children aged 10–12 years, whether they 
are in school or not, particularly in poorer, 
less developed provinces and territories. 
In Balochistan, the percentage of girls in 
grade 5 who can read a passage in Urdu, 
Sindhi or Pashto was, on average, almost 
the same as for boys, but among all children 
aged 10–12 years, girls underperformed 
boys by 5 percentage points; in the Federally 
Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), girls 
underperformed by 14 percentage points in 
reading (Figure 5.10). 

Although limited, research suggests that in 
some poorer countries, girls face greater 
disadvantage in national examinations than  
boys, raising obstacles to their continued 
schooling. Even though girls in grade 6 scored 
higher than boys in the 2007 SACMEQ III  
learning assessment, girls’ pass rates in  
national examinations in Kenya and 
Zimbabwe were significantly lower than 
boys’ (Mukhopondhyay et al., 2012). National 
examinations at the end of the primary cycle  
can form part of high-stakes selection  
processes in which failure to pass or perform 
well prevents transition to lower secondary.  
In Kenya and Malawi, for example, performance 
in exams for primary school leaving certificates 
determines entry into state-funded secondary 
schools (Mukhopondhyay et al., 2012).  
More research is needed to understand  
factors affecting gender gaps in performance 
across subjects and at key stages in the 
education cycle.

underestimated if we consider only those children in school

Tackling boys’ underachievement

Concern over boys’ underachievement in 
learning outcomes, particularly reading and 
languages, has grown since 2000. Yet only 
a few countries with marked gender gaps 
have comprehensive policy frameworks to 
address this concern. European countries and 
economies, such as the Flemish Community of 
Belgium, Ireland and the United Kingdom, have 
made reducing boys’ underachievement a policy 
priority. Government concerns have largely been 
driven by results of national and international 
assessment tests, such as PISA, which have 
highlighted the widening gender gap in reading 
skills and have received significant media 
attention in some countries. The ‘PISA shock’ in 
2000, for example, led to Austria mainstreaming 
initiatives that promote reading and boys’ 
achievement (Eurydice, 2010; OECD, 2012a). In 
England (United Kingdom), a series of projects 
has targeted gender-related performance in 
schools (Box 5.4).

Strategies and small-scale interventions in 
teaching and learning that have potential 
to tackle boys’ low achievement include a

GOAL 5: GENDER PARITY AND EQUALITYSupporting equality in learning outcomesBox 5.4: Raising boys’ achievement in 
reading in the United Kingdom

In the United Kingdom, there is a persistent gap between 
the achievement of boys and girls in English, particularly 
in reading skills. In England, several school-based 
programmes have been implemented since 2000 to 
address this. The Raising Boys’ Achievements project 
ran from 2000 to 2004 in primary and secondary 
schools. Building on its results, the Gender Agenda 
project aimed to improve performance among groups of 
underperforming boys and girls. It included a guidance 
document for teachers; a publication to dispel myths 
about gender and education; and ‘Gap Busters’, a 
research project on schools that had consistently closed 
or narrowed the gender gap in English. Key features of 
such schools included the use of speaking and listening 
in lessons to prepare pupils for writing and exploring 
texts, modelling of both reading and writing to improve 
pupils’ understanding and skills, the use of ICT to engage 
pupils, and individual help for preparing for tests. The 
schools also had an ethos that valued respect for others, 
rewarded effort and maintained a strong emphasis on 
listening to pupils’ views.

Another initiative, Premier League Reading Stars, uses 
footballers as role models to engage students in literacy 
activities. Promotions and awards promote participation. 
In 2012, over 34,000 children, of whom 75% were boys, 
took part. The programme typically lasts 10 weeks; in the 
2012 programme, 56% of the pupils made half a year’s 
progress in reading and 17% made a year’s progress.

transferable skills emphasis, classroom 
approaches that foster active learning, individual 
mentoring and target-setting, and a school 
ethos promoting respect and cooperation 
(Jha et al., 2012). In Seychelles, the very large 
gender differences in reading performance 
in the SACMEQ II and III assessments – boys 
underperformed girls by 48 points in SACMEQ 
III – were attributed to ‘within-school streaming’ 
(Hungi, 2011), a practice said to negatively 
label those in lower classes and reinforce poor 
performance (Leste et al., 2005). Efforts to  
‘de-stream’ classes so student groupings were 
of mixed ability and gender-balanced were 
reported to have met with some initial success 
(Reid, 2011). A recent study from the United 
States indicates that both boys and girls achieve 
better in classrooms where more girls are 
present (DiPrete and Buchmann, 2013).

Girls’ participation and performance in 
mathematics and science

A global agenda to enhance gender equality 
in education and labour market opportunities 
has improved the focus on increasing girls’ 
achievement and participation in mathematics 
and science. With gender gaps in mathematics 
performance declining in international 
assessments and those in science largely 
eliminated, a key challenge since 2000 has been to 
address girls’ motivation and subject choice. PISA 
2012 results show that even when girls perform 
as well as boys in mathematics, they tend to 
report less motivation to learn mathematics, less 
belief in their ability and greater anxiety about 
the subject. They are also more likely than boys 
to attribute failure in mathematics to themselves 
rather than to external factors (OECD, 2014f).

This phenomenon appears to stem from cultural 
norms and discriminatory practices present 
from an early age. A cross-country analysis of 
mathematics test scores in 10 low and middle 
income countries found evidence of a clear 
gender gap in mathematics performance 
favouring boys, and the gap nearly doubled when 
comparing fourth and eighth grade students. 
Lower performance was strongly associated with 
girls’ self-reported expectations of their abilities 
in mathematics – they were more pessimistic 
than boys. Gender stereotyping and societal 
expectations lead girls to be less confident in their 
own mathematics ability, which in turn affects 
learning outcomes (Bharadwaj et al., 2012). 
A study of girls in grades 1 to 5 in the United 
States found anxiety about mathematics could 
be reduced if female teachers received more 
training in teaching mathematics and addressed 
stereotypical beliefs about gender differences in 
students’ ability (Antecol et al., 2012).

In South Africa, the National Strategy in 
Mathematics and Science, launched in 2001, 
was dedicated to increasing participation and 
performance in grade 12 examinations in 
these subjects, focusing on female students. 
Incentives for girls included preferential access 
to schools dedicated to good quality teaching 
of mathematics and science (South Africa 
Department of Education, 2001). In three years, 
achievement in participating schools increased by 
30% in physical science and 22% in mathematics 
(South Africa Department of Education, 2004).

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 51025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportConclusion

Evidence reviewed in this chapter demonstrates 
progress since 2000 towards gender parity and 
equality in education around the world. This is 
crucial to ensure the rights of all children to a 
good quality education, one which provides the 
foundations for the rest of their lives. Progress 
has been supported by mainstreaming gender 
in education institutions, civil society support 
and advocacy, and community mobilization, as 
well as by government policy, legal and policy 
frameworks, and the resources to ensure that 
these are implemented at the district, school 
and community levels.

Gender must be addressed in interconnected 
private and public arenas, including educational 
institutions. Gender-based violence and 
discrimination in schools and classrooms negate 
positive schooling experiences and outcomes, 
and perpetuate inequality in gender relations. 
Even in countries where girls and boys achieve 
equally well and gain similar levels of education, 
women are still under-represented and face 
disproportionate disadvantage in political, 
economic and civic life.

Increasing the availability and accessibility 
of education by reducing school costs and 
improving infrastructure has helped expand 
girls’ enrolment and reduce gender gaps. 
Serious disparity in educational attainment 
remains, however, and, in the case of boys’ 
disadvantage, continues to emerge.

Achieving gender equality in education and 
society requires cooperation and involvement 
of men, women, boys and girls, from the 
community level to the national and international 
levels. Everyone has much to gain from gender 
equality and a gender-just society.

International agencies and NGOs have  
supported initiatives to improve girls’ 
participation and performance in mathematics 
and science in several developing countries.  
The Capacity Building in Scientific and 
Technological Literacy programme in Nepal, 
supported by UNESCO, aimed to raise 
awareness and promote gender-inclusive 
approaches to teaching mathematics and 
science (Koirala and Acharya, 2005). Several 
smaller programmes have also been 
implemented, such as the USAID-funded 2006 
Girls Science Camp in Zanzibar, United Republic 
of Tanzania, in partnership with the Ministry of 
Education and Vocational Training and the Aga 
Khan Foundation (USAID, 2008). Information 
regarding the uptake and impact of such 
initiatives, however, remains scarce.

Subject choice can limit labour 
market opportunities

Lower achievement and negative aspirations 
and career expectations may help explain the 
continued under-representation of women 
enrolled in science and mathematics-related 
subjects in post-secondary education, including 
subjects in great demand in the labour market 
such as computing and engineering. 

Between 2000 and 2009, the proportion of 
female computer science graduates fell in most 
OECD countries. This was most pronounced 
in Ireland, the Republic of Korea and Sweden, 
where the proportion of female computer 
science graduates fell from around 40% to under 
one-quarter of total graduates (OECD, 2012a). 
This is reflected in prevailing gender gaps in 
the labour market. In the United States, in 2011 
less than one-quarter of workers in science, 
technology, engineering and mathematics-
related employment were women. Female 
under-representation exacerbates gender 
gaps in income, as workers in these fields earn 
significantly more than counterparts in other 
fields (Beede et al., 2011). 

Providing vocational guidance with a gender 
perspective can challenge gender stereotyping 
in school cultures, and among students and 
employers regarding study and career options. 
Making provision for work-related learning at 
secondary school can build students’ interest in 
particular subjects (Rolfe and Crowley, 2008).

Highlights ■Pupil/teacher ratios declined in about 83% of the 146 countries with data at the primary education level. However, more progress is needed, particularly in making sure teachers are properly trained – the ratio of pupils to trained teachers is higher than 100:1 in Central African Republic, Chad, Guinea-Bissau and South Sudan. ■At the lower secondary education level, 87 out of 105 countries with data have a pupil/teacher ratio below 30:1.  ■Despite rapid increases in teacher recruitment, in one-third of the 91 countries with data for 2012, less than 75% of primary school teachers were trained according to national standards. ■Since 1990, countries’ interest in improving education quality through assessing learning achievements has risen significantly. In 1990, only 12 learning assessments were conducted according to national standards; this increased to 101 assessments in 2013.  ■Expanding opportunity for education does not necessarily impact quality: In Kenya, the proportion of children reaching the end of primary school increased from 42% in 2000 to 62% in 2007, while at the same time, learning outcomes for children from both poor and rich households also improved. ■The quality and availability of teacher training, scarcity of textbooks and resources, and class size remain serious challenges affecting education quality. 1025Quality of education ......................189

All of the EFA goals share the 
quest for good quality education. 
This chapter makes the case that 
it is possible to expand access to 
education while improving teaching 
and learning. It underscores the 
importance of investing in teachers, 
instructional materials, curriculum 
development, effective pedagogy, 
teaching in mother tongue languages 
and using appropriate technology. It 
describes increased country efforts to 
measure learning outcomes through 
the use of national and international 
assessments.

Education is compulsory in Mexico for all children from 
pre-school to secondary school levels. The government 
has implemented programs to ensure educational 
quality across the board, with a particular focus on 
gender, marginalized groups and indigenous groups. 
Efforts have been made to improve digital literacy and 
the systematic evaluation of learning in order to guide 
educational policy. The country has also improved adult 
literacy and education programs.”

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALL1025Education for All Global Monitoring Report  Goal 6    Quality of education

Improving all aspects of the quality of education and ensuring excellence of 
all so that recognized and measurable learning outcomes are achieved by all, 
especially in literacy, numeracy and essential life skills.

In 1990, the World Declaration on Education 
for All (EFA) committed countries to improving 
quality of education. The declaration identified 
quality as a prerequisite for achieving the 
fundamental goal of equity. It recognized that 
expanding access alone would be insufficient for 
education to contribute fully to the development 
of individuals and society.

A decade later, the Dakar Framework for 
Action declared that access to an education 
of good quality was the right of every child. It 
affirmed that quality was the heart of education, 
a fundamental determinant of enrolment, 
retention and achievement. It expanded the 
definition of quality to address desirable 
characteristics of learners, processes, facilities, 
learning materials, content, governance and 
management, and learning outcomes.

Even though good quality education has been 
at the core of EFA goals, international attention 
has focused until recently on universal primary 
education: effective policies and sustained 
national investment in education have resulted in 
far fewer children in developing countries being 
out of school (see Chapter 2).

While many countries have made impressive 
gains in access to education since Dakar, 
improvement in quality has not always kept pace. 
A discernible shift in emphasis towards quality 
and learning is likely to become more central 
to the post-2015 global framework, since, as 
the 2013/14 EFA Global Monitoring Report (GMR) 
showed, 250 million children have not had the 
chance to learn the basics – and 130 million of 
them have spent at least four years in school.

This chapter reviews progress to show that it 
is possible to improve access and education 
quality at the same time, then discusses how 
monitoring has emerged as a central theme 
now that concern has shifted in many countries 
towards education quality. It provides an overview 
of the role of national, regional and international 
assessments in better monitoring of education 

quality as measured by learning outcomes. 
The chapter then covers four areas key to 
improving quality: teachers, textbooks and other 
instructional materials and facilities, teaching and 
learning processes, and governance (including 
both decentralization and private schooling). 
Each section aims to provide a systematic 
assessment of progress since Dakar. The chapter 
also discusses government reform initiatives to 
achieve the goal of improving quality of education, 
and highlights the challenges encountered.

It is possible to improve 
access and equitable learning 
simultaneously

Has the expansion of education gone hand in 
hand with progress towards better learning? 
New populations entering the school system are 
more likely to come from marginalized groups, 
have disabilities and be affected by malnutrition 
and poverty. And they are less likely to come from 
households with literate parents or where an 
official language is spoken. As these background 
characteristics are associated with lower 
learning achievement, a decline in quality could 
be expected to accompany increased enrolment. 
Yet findings from regional and international 
learning assessments do not bear this out.

Analysis presented in the 2013/14 EFA GMR 
shows that, in some countries in sub-Saharan 
Africa, the number of children entering and 
completing school rose between the 2000 and 
2007 surveys of the Southern and Eastern 
Africa Consortium for Monitoring Educational 
Quality (SACMEQ). At the same time, learning 
outcomes improved or were maintained. Kenya 
increased the proportion of children reaching 
the end of primary school from 42% in 2000 to 
62% in 2007. Over these years, learning also 
improved with the proportion of children who 
were both in school and achieving the minimum 
learning standard in mathematics rising from

GOAL 6: QUALITY OF EDUCATIONQuality of educationIn Ghana, 
learning 
disparities 
narrowed 
across regions 
as access rose

25% to 39%. Children from both poor and rich 
households benefited from this progress.

In secondary education, too, access and 
equitable learning can increase side by side. In 
Ghana, the secondary net enrolment ratio rose 
from 36% in 2003 to 46% in 2009, with greater 
access across the country, especially in rural 
areas. New analysis by the GMR team of data 
from the Trends in International Mathematics 
and Science Study (TIMSS), moreover, shows 
learning disparity across regions narrowing 
(Figure 6.1). The gaps in grade 8 mathematics 
scores between Greater Accra and other 
regions were smaller in 2011 than in 2003. This 
equalizing trend occurred as the mean score 
increased from 286 to 328 points.

In Mexico, enrolment of 15-year-olds increased 
by almost 12 percentage points between 2003 
and 2012 while the mean scores in mathematics 
in the Programme for International Student 
Assessment (PISA) increased from 385 to 
413 points. The most disadvantaged students 
witnessed the largest increases. As a result, 
the gap in scores between advantaged and 
disadvantaged students narrowed from 60 to 38 
points (OECD, 2012e). Policies were aimed at 
improving performance of low achieving schools 
and students by allocating more resources to the 
regions and schools most in need.

Progress in learning outcomes 
should be monitored

The Dakar Framework, by placing quality at the 
heart of EFA, emphasizes the need for effective 
strategies to assess and monitor knowledge 
and skills and demonstrate measurable 
learning outcomes. This section discusses 
a distinct element of such strategies: large-
scale learning assessments based on sample 
surveys that provide information on education 
systems as a whole.

More countries are conducting 
national assessments

More and more countries are carrying out 
national assessments1 that provide countrywide 
information about learning outcomes according 
to nationally defined standards.2 In the past 
25 years, the number of national assessments 
has grown sharply, increasing from 12 in 1990 
to 101 in 2013 (Benavot and Köseleci, 2015). 
The trend occurred not only among more 
affluent countries, but also among poorer ones 
(Figure 6.2). In developing countries, 8 national 
assessments were conducted in 1990, 35 in 
1999 and 64 in 2013. As a result, global disparity 
in participation in assessments has narrowed 
(see Overview).

1. National learning assessments evaluate learning outcomes on the basis 
of criteria and expectations set by national education authorities. Also called 
system assessments or assessments of learning outcomes, they can be 
defined as exercises designed to describe the level of achievements not of 
individual students but of an education system or a clearly defined part of it 
(e.g. fourth grade pupils or 11-year-olds).
2. A global overview of national assessment and evaluation activities can be

Source: EFA Global Monitoring Report team calculations (2015) based on annex data on national learning assessments.

National assessments focus more on grades 
4–6 than grades 1–3 and 7–9. Between 2007 
and 2013, a cumulative total of 118 countries 
conducted at least one national assessment of 
learning outcomes in grades 4–6. There were 
also 68 assessments for grades 1–3 and 84 for 
grades 7–9. The number of countries with at 
least one national learning assessment at the 
lower secondary level significantly increased, 
particularly during the second half of the 
post-Dakar period.

National assessments are predominantly 
curriculum-based and subject-oriented. 
Language (100%) and mathematics (98%) are 
by far the predominant subjects. More than 
half the countries that conducted assessments 
between 2000 and 2013 assessed learning 
outcomes in science, almost two-fifths (36%) in 
the social sciences, 33% in foreign languages 
and 20% in other subjects, including art, physical 
education, problem solving, life skills, visual 
literacy, cognitive behaviour and music. A closer 
look at results between 1990 and 2013 shows 
foreign languages gaining prominence, from 
21% before Dakar to 29% in 2000–2006 and 34% 
in 2007–2013.

Though they differ in assessment methods and 
scales, sample designs and methodological 
rigour, most national assessments call on 
education authorities to improve student 
knowledge levels and competencies. They 
often highlight the extent to which student 
learning objectives are achieved, differences 
in achievement levels by subgroups and, if 

background data are collected, the strength of 
associations between the quality of learning 
and various school- and system-level factors 
(Greaney and Kellaghan, 2008).

A systematic review of 54 studies shows that 
the range of education policies resulting 
from the use of national assessment data is 
wide, from curriculum reform and textbook 
revision to teacher education and ongoing 
training, instructional material development, 
parent engagement, performance standards 
and allocation of resources to support poorly 
performing schools (Best et al., 2013). In Brazil, 
the Prova Brasil national assessment system 
was used to build an Index of Basic Education 
Development, combining measurements of 
students’ learning and progress, including 
repetition, grade progression and graduation 
rates (Bruns et al 2012). In Chile, data from 
the national assessment were used to analyse 
the impact of monetary incentives on school 
performance (Mizala and Urquiola, 2013). 

Citizen-led assessments gain ground

Increasing use of assessments is supported by 
a wider movement towards evidence-informed 
policy and practice in education and in other 
fields (Wiseman, 2010). Academic and media 
freedom, the development of civil society and 
the stability and openness of political systems 
are important factors in whether, and how 
much, evidence can be gathered, assessed 
and communicated to influence policy-making 
(Sutcliffe and Court, 2005). Research restrictions

GOAL 6: QUALITY OF EDUCATIONProgress in learning outcomes should be monitoredare increasingly being overcome in some 
countries, leading to more evidence-based policy 
in the education sector (Best et al., 2013).

Government action has not been the only 
route to effective assessment systems 
for informing national policy. Citizen-led, 
household-based assessment initiatives 
began in India in 2005 and have been adapted 
in Pakistan (since 2008), Kenya, Uganda and 
the United Republic of Tanzania (2009), Mali 
(2011) and Senegal (2012). Together, they 
reached more than a million children in 2012 
(ASER Centre, 2014a). 

Civil society organizations in these countries 
have initiated assessments of children’s basic 
reading and arithmetic abilities. In India, the 
Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 
reported that, while India’s education system 
succeeded at enrolling many more children, 
there were wide disparities in students’ 
achievement of basic skills across states, 
a finding validated in the official National 
Achievement Survey of grade 3 students (Indian 
Ministry of Human Resource Development, 
2014). ASER further noted a small decline in 
reading outcomes in recent years, and a larger 
one in mathematics (ASER Centre, 2014b).3 The 
ASER findings have been used to inform policy. 
For example, they were cited in the education 
chapter of the government’s 12th five-year 
plan, which emphasized basic learning as an 
explicit objective of primary education as well 
as the need for regular learning assessments 
to make sure quality goals are met (Banerjee 
et al., 2013).

Recent ASER results in rural Pakistan provide 
a stark illustration of the challenge to equitably 
enable all children to acquire basic skills 
(Figure 6.3). In 2014 in Balochistan province, 
only 33% of grade 5 students could read a 
story in Urdu, Sindhi or Pashto, whereas in the 
wealthier province of Punjab, 63% could do 
so. In Balochistan, only 24% of fifth-graders 
could do a division exercise, compared with 
50% in Punjab.

Assessments are used to take the pulse  
of early grade learning

Very poor levels of learning in lower primary 
grades are resulting in millions of children 
leaving education before acquiring basic skills. 
Children who do not learn to read a text or do 
basic calculations in the lower grades are likely 
to struggle throughout their school careers, their 
commitment to education is likely to diminish 
and they are more likely to drop out.

USAID, with the support of UNICEF, the World 
Bank and several bilateral donors, promotes 
early grade reading assessments (EGRAs) and 
early grade mathematics assessments (EGMAs). 
Between 2007 and mid-2014, more than 
60 countries carried out one or more EGRAs. In 
several countries, EGRAs covered a nationally 
representative sample.4 By mid-2014, more than 
20 countries had conducted EGMAs.

The EGRAs paint an alarming picture: many 
children spend two or three years in school

United Republic of Tanzania, 40% of second-
graders could not read a word of Kiswahili. In 
Ghana, 80% of grade 2 students were unable 
to respond correctly to questions about a 
passage read aloud to them in English (RTI 
International, 2015).

In several countries, even when the language 
of instruction is what most pupils speak at 
home, children perform poorly. In Malawi, 94% 
of second-graders could not respond correctly 
to a single question about a story they read in 
Chichewa, the national language. In Iraq, 25% of 
third-graders were unable to tell the sound of a 
letter in Arabic (RTI International, 2015).

Many schools do not teach students the basics 
of arithmetic in their early years. In Nicaragua 
in 2011, around 60% of second-graders could 
not identify numbers correctly and more than 
90% were unable to answer a subtraction 
question. Even in grade 4, almost 20% and 70%, 
respectively, failed at these tasks (Figure 6.4).

EGRA results have prompted governments 
and donors to rethink policies so that students 
achieve minimum learning standards in reading 
and mathematics (RTI International, 2015).

originated in the 1960s with the International 
Association for the Evaluation of Educational 
Achievement studies and expanded in the 1990s 
to include more countries in mathematics, 
science, reading literacy and civic education. By 
estimating consistent and repeated measures of 
proficiency, cross-national assessments make 
it possible to compare progress across various 
socio-political environments.

Two important studies, from the Latin American 
Laboratory for Education Evaluation and Quality 
(LLECE) and the OECD, permit measurement of 
progress and inequality in learning outcomes of 
cross-national assessments. LLECE, founded in 
1994, conducted its First Regional Comparative 
and Evaluation Study (PERCE) in 1997, the 
second cross-national study (SERCE) in 2006 and 
the third study, TERCE, in 2013. TERCE, reaching 
15 countries and one Mexican state, assessed 
mathematics, reading, written expression and 
science. The resulting data allow assessment of 
organizational, curricular and family-background 
components of students’ academic proficiency, 
and of overall national progress, including 
towards the elimination of inequality, showing 
for example that many countries – most notably 
Ecuador – made significant improvement in 
national mean scores.

Regional and international assessments are 
crucial for measuring equity in learning

In addition to the growing use of national 
assessments, countries have increasingly joined 
cross-national and cross-system comparisons 
of student achievement. Cross-national testing 

SERCE and TERCE comparisons reveal that 
the rural–urban gap has been reduced overall. 
In 2006, most countries showed very large 
gaps in reading proficiency between urban and 
rural students. Although some gaps persisted 
in 2013, it is encouraging that, in all but three 
countries, the urban–rural gap substantially

narrowed (Figure 6.5). This reduction of 
inequality occurred over the same period that 
mean achievement increased, similar to the 
experience shown previously in the case of 
Ghana (Figure 6.1). In Latin America, there 
is also evidence that it is possible to improve 
quality while simultaneously increasing equity.

The OECD launched the Programme for 
International Student Assessment in 2000. 
PISA focused on 15-year-olds, regardless of 
their school year, and collected information 
from students that made it possible to relate 
inequality in social origin to their literacy and 
numeracy. The PISA methodology included an 
index of family economic and socio-cultural 
status (ESCS) and allowed comparisons in each 
country between the reading scores of students 
in the most-advantaged quintile of students 
on the ESCS index with the least-advantaged 
students in the bottom quintile. Gaps narrowed 
considerably in many countries between 2000 
and 2012. Only in two countries did it widen 
substantially, one of which – Peru – was also 
the country with the widest rural–urban gap in 
LLECE studies (Figure 6.6).

Regional and international assessments  
affect policy discourse …

Regional and international assessments have 
become essential to reviewing and supporting 
education policy design. A majority of OECD 
countries have initiated policy reform and 
initiatives in direct response to PISA results 
(Breakspear, 2012). In Germany, the mediocre 
student performance in PISA 2000 came as 
a shock to teachers, researchers and policy-
makers. It triggered sustained public debate 
and resulted in significant reform, such as the 
adoption of national standards and increased 
support for disadvantaged students, especially 
those from immigrant backgrounds (Ertl, 
2006). In Mauritius and Seychelles, SACMEQ 
assessments catalysed widespread public 
debate about the extent of grade repetition and 
private tutoring (Murimba, 2005). In Seychelles, 
the discovery of wide learning disparity among 
schools prompted a policy change away from 
streaming by ability (Leste, 2005).

In low and middle income countries, PISA 
participation has helped build national capacity 
for using data through the drafting of national 
reports, analysis of results and assessment of 
a wider range of skills (Bloem, 2013). Similarly, 
interviews with developing country officials 
and national research coordinators for TIMSS 
2007 showed how national participation had 
strengthened and enhanced technical knowledge 
and skills for assessment (Lockheed, 2010).

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 61025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportLearning 
assessments 
have influenced 
curricular and 
instructional 
reform in many 
countries

Learning assessments have also influenced 
curricular and instructional reform in many 
countries. Of the 18 developing countries that 
participated in TIMSS-Repeat in 1999, 8 changed 
classroom instructions to emphasize methods 
such as activity-based learning, problem-solving 
in mathematics and more critical thinking in 
science (Elley, 2005). In Kyrgyzstan, educational 
reform in response to PISA 2006 results 
included a reorganization of instructional time 
and improvement to teaching standards and 
performance (Shamatov and Sainazarov, 2010).

… but they also pose their own challenges

Despite their positive impact, the challenges of 
using regional and international assessments 
are acknowledged. Data can be inappropriately 
used. Publishing comparisons of participating 
countries can discourage participation by poorer 
countries where few children are learning the 
basics. The cost of participation in a large-
scale assessment can be substantial for many 
developing countries, which are likely to require 
support from international aid agencies. The 
need for cross-country comparability may 
mean countries are asked to assess unfamiliar 
curriculum areas; countries may reorient 
education systems accordingly but in ways that 
do not suit their circumstances. An important 
issue is that the assessments do not include 
information on children out of school, something 
PISA surveys aim to address (Box 6.1).

Box 6.1: PISA for Development

A recent initiative, at the pilot stage, is PISA for 
Development, which began in 2013. It has three 
objectives: First, as the experience of low income 
countries participating in 2009 showed, PISA instruments 
could not accurately measure the performance of 
students scoring at the lower end of the performance 
range. The project will try to increase the instruments’ 
sensitivity yet still produce results consistent with the 
international PISA scales.

Second, unlike citizen-led household assessments of 
learning outcomes, such as ASER – which survey the 
learning achievement of all children, whether in school 
or not – regional and international learning assessments 
only test children in school. The assessment process 
is too complex to organize easily elsewhere. However, 
this leaves a big gap in the knowledge of children who 
have been to school but have left, especially in poorer 
countries with large proportions of out-of-school youth. 
The project will try to identify ways to assess the skills of 
15-year-olds who are not in school and raise their profile 
among education policy-makers.

Third, background questionnaires will need to be 
adjusted to capture the characteristics of youth in poorer 
countries who may be out of school.

The countries currently expected to take part are 
Cambodia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Senegal, the United 
Republic of Tanzania and Zambia. Results are to be 
published by the end of 2017.

GOAL 6: QUALITY OF EDUCATIONProgress in learning outcomes should be monitoredInvesting in teachers 
is essential

The Dakar Framework recognized the pre-
eminent role of teachers in providing basic 
education of good quality. It stressed that, to 
achieve EFA, governments need to enhance 
the status, morale and professionalism of 
teachers and enable them to participate in 
actions affecting their professional lives and 
teaching environments. To attract and retain 
good teachers, policy-makers need to improve 
teacher education, deploy teachers more fairly, 
provide incentives in the form of appropriate 
salaries, and create attractive career paths 
(UNESCO, 2014c).

This section examines progress in the quantity, 
quality and distribution of the teaching force, 
highlights national efforts to improve the 
availability and deployment of skilled and 
motivated teachers, and reviews the challenges 
involved in hiring contract teachers and 
improving the status of the teaching profession.

Despite progress, teacher shortages  
remain a serious concern

The pupil/teacher ratio measures the number 
of teachers in relation to the number of pupils. 
As of 2012, 29 of the 161 countries with data 

had pupil/teacher ratios in primary education 
exceeding 40:1. Of these, 24 were in sub-
Saharan Africa, where the highest ratio is that of 
the Central African Republic, 80:1. 

Several country trends since Dakar are notable 
(Figure 6.7). Primary pupil/teacher ratios 
declined in 121 (83%) of the 146 countries 
with data for both 1999 and 2012. Many of the 
improvements occurred in countries that already 
had pupil/teacher ratios below 40:1.

In seven countries, including the Democratic 
Republic of the Congo, Pakistan and Yemen, the 
pupil/teacher ratio increased by 24% or more. 
In Afghanistan, it increased by 31%, from 33:1 
in 1999 to 44:1 in 2011. An almost fivefold rise in 
the teaching force was not enough to meet the 
almost sevenfold rise in primary enrolment. By 
contrast, the ratio decreased by at least 20% in 
63 countries. Congo and Mali more than doubled 
their primary school enrolment while reducing 
their pupil/teacher ratios by 16 and about 14 
pupils per teachers, respectively.

Of the 30 countries with a pupil/teacher ratio 
above 40:1 at the time of Dakar, 8 managed to 
bring it below 40:1 by 2012. Equatorial Guinea, 
Gabon and Timor-Leste dramatically reduced 
the ratio, by nearly 50% or more. But in Malawi 
it increased by 17% to 74:1 in 2012, from an 
already high level of 63:1 in 1999.

105 countries had data for 2012, 18 had ratios 
above 30:1, including Bangladesh, Chad, 
Mauritania and Zambia. Between 1999 and 2012, 
the ratios grew by more than six pupils per 
teacher in Ethiopia, the Gambia, Guinea, Mali 
and Myanmar (Figure 6.8). Each experienced a 
significant rise in the gross enrolment ratio, far 

outstripping any increase in teacher numbers 
and raising serious concern for education quality 
in these countries. Yet some countries with 
growing lower secondary enrolment improved 
their pupil/teacher ratios significantly. In Togo, 
the gross enrolment ratio rose from nearly 39% 
in 1999 to 68% in 2011 while the pupil/teacher 
ratio fell from 44:1 to 34:1.

GOAL 6: QUALITY OF EDUCATIONInvesting in teachers is essentialAt the upper secondary level, out of 97 countries 
with data for 2012, only Bangladesh, the 
Dominican Republic, Eritrea, Nigeria and Yemen 
had ratios above 30:1. Upper secondary pupil/
teacher ratios stayed constant or decreased in 
most countries over the last decade, markedly 
so in Eritrea (from 45:1 to 31:1). However, this 
analysis includes only 13% of countries in  
sub-Saharan Africa, the region that suffers 
the worst teacher shortages at the upper 
secondary level.

How many primary school teachers were 
needed to reach universal primary education 
by 2015?

Future teacher recruitment needs are 
determined by current deficits and a complex 
mix of demographics, enrolment trends and 
numbers of children out of school. Recent 
analysis by the UNESCO Institute of Statistics 
(UIS) and the GMR team showed that, between 
2012 and 2015, around 4 million primary school 
teachers would need to be recruited of which 
(UNESCO, 2014i): 2.6 million to replace teachers 
who retired, changed occupations, died or 
left due to illness, and 1.4 million to make up 
shortfalls, address expanding enrolment and 
underwrite quality by keeping pupil/teacher 
ratios below 40:1. Thus, around 450,000 
additional teachers would be needed each year 
to have sufficient teachers by 2015.

Some regions and countries would need many 
more additional primary school teachers 
than others. The region facing the greatest 
challenge, by a large margin, was sub-Saharan 
Africa, accounting for well over half (63%) of 
the additional teachers needed to achieve 
UPE by 2015. An assessment by country 
showed that the biggest challenge remained 
in Nigeria, with 220,000 additional primary 
school teachers needed between 2012 and 
2015 – 15% of the global total. All but 1 of the 10 
developing countries needing the most additional 
primary teachers were in sub-Saharan Africa; 
the exception, Pakistan, needed around 
86,000 teachers (UIS, 2014c).

Have countries proved able to recruit enough 
teachers by 2015? It is unlikely, particularly 
for those with the widest gaps. Among the 93 
countries needing to recruit additional primary 
school teachers, only 29 (31%) were on track 

to do so by 2015, leaving 64 with shortfalls. 
The implication is that hopes of achieving UPE 
by 2015 will turn out to have been thwarted by 
continuing teacher shortages (UNESCO, 2014i).

Trained teachers: The most severe shortages

Improving the quantity of teachers will not be 
enough; quality needs improvement, too, with 
teachers well trained and motivated. Many 
countries have expanded teacher numbers 
rapidly by hiring people without the proper 
qualifications and training. Among the 91 
countries with 2012 data, the percentage of 
trained primary school teachers according to 
national standards national standards ranged 
from 39% in Guinea-Bissau to more than 95% in 
31 countries.

More than half the 50 countries with data 
for 1999 and 2012 increased the percentage 
of trained teachers, in some cases by wide 
margins. Kyrgyzstan, Malawi, Myanmar, Nepal, 
Rwanda and Togo raised the share by more 
than 50%. Others, including Benin, Kuwait, 
Ghana and Swaziland, moved in the opposite 
direction, with percentages of trained teachers 
declining significantly.

Ratios of pupils to trained teachers are above 
100:1 in 2012 in Central African Republic, Chad,  
Guinea-Bissau and South Sudan, and above 
40:1 in 38 other countries in sub-Saharan 
Africa. Countries with no severe shortage of 
total teachers may have shortages of trained 
teachers. In Bangladesh, there was a wide gap in 
2011 between the number of pupils per teacher 
(40:1) and per trained teacher (70:1).

Between 1999 and 2012, pupil/trained teacher 
ratios declined in 44 out of 50 countries with 
data (Figure 6.9). In Nepal, the decrease was 
from 260:1 in 1999 to 28:1 in 2013, a huge 
improvement due to a policy of upgrading 
teacher qualifications to require additional 
training (Dundar et al., 2014).

Projections made for 46 countries with data 
shows that 12 of them, including Belize, Lesotho 
and Nicaragua, will have less than 75% of their 
primary school teaching workforce trained 
according to national standards by 2015. 
Half of the other 34 countries will have made 
strong progress, increasing the percentage of

(Bruneforth, 2015).

41:1 in Uttar Pradesh and 38:1 in Bihar to 23:1 in 
Andhra Pradesh in 2013/14 (NUEPA, 2014).

Many countries are not training enough 
secondary school teachers. Projections 
to 2015 indicate that, of the 24 countries 
with data, 7, including Myanmar and the 
United Arab Emirates, will have made strong 
progress, increasing the share of trained 
teachers in secondary education by at least 20% 
(Bruneforth, 2015).

Equity gaps in teacher deployment 
need tackling

Total teacher numbers and average pupil/
teacher ratios can conceal unequal distributions 
of teachers within countries, raising equity 
concerns. Imbalances can be associated with 
school type, geographical location and teacher 
training. There is generally a marked and 
sustained gap between government and non-
government providers. Analysis by the GMR team 
of data from the UIS database showed that, in 
several countries, including Congo, Rwanda and 
Uganda, the pupil/teacher ratio of public primary 
schools exceeds that of private schools by nearly 
30 pupils or more. Regional differences can 
add inequality. Although average primary pupil/
teacher ratios have improved in recent years, 
geographical variations persist in India, from 

Students in disadvantaged schools are often 
taught by teachers with less preparation than 
those in wealthier ones. In Mongolia, mathematics 
teachers’ preparedness levels are 10 to 19 points 
higher if they teach affluent children who report 
speaking the test language at home (Chudgar 
et al., 2013). In South Africa, teachers with good 
knowledge of mathematics and reading are 
more commonly deployed to urban and better-
resourced schools (Altinok, 2013a).

Inequality in trained teacher deployment is 
not confined to developing countries. In the 
United States, high attrition underlies many 
schools’ problems staffing classrooms with 
qualified teachers. Attrition, especially among 
ethnic minority teachers, undermines efforts to 
recruit new teachers in disadvantaged schools 
and to diversify the teaching force (Auguste et 
al., 2010; Ingersoll et al., 2014).

Over the past decade, governments have tried 
to address challenges to teacher deployment in 
various ways, including centralized deployment; 
incentives such as housing, financial benefits 
and accelerated promotion; and local 
recruitment (Chudgar and Luschei, 2015).

GOAL 6: QUALITY OF EDUCATIONInvesting in teachers is essentialCentralized and planned deployment systems 
have had varying results. In Eritrea, the 
government assigns teachers to one of 
six regions and to specific schools, strictly 
depending on student numbers. By 2004/05, 
teachers were more equitably distributed where 
they were most needed (Mulkeen, 2010). By 
contrast, in the United Republic of Tanzania, 
centralized deployment has not addressed 
wide variations in pupil/teacher ratios and 
disadvantaged areas are left with the least 
experienced teachers (Chudgar and Luschei, 
2015). Such systems also risk demotivating 
teachers or having teachers trade the assigned 
post internally or subcontract it to someone who 
is not qualified (Steiner-Khamsi, 2015).

Incentive programmes attract teachers with 
better pay and working conditions. In the 
Republic of Korea, teachers in disadvantaged 
schools benefit from incentives such as an 
additional stipend, smaller class size, less 
teaching time, the chance to choose their 
next school after teaching in a difficult area 
and greater promotion opportunities (Kang 
and Hong, 2008). As a result, 77% of teachers 
in villages have a higher qualification than a 
bachelor’s degree, compared with 32% in large 
cities (Luschei et al., 2013).

Another approach to counter attrition and 
other challenges is recruiting teachers from 
within the communities to be served. It has 
been argued that closer social distance, in 
terms of gender and cultural and/or religious 
background, between locally recruited teachers 
and their students has a positive impact on 
learning (Rawal and Kingdon, 2010). A need for 
increased accountability has also driven local 
recruitment policies, particularly in countries 
where teacher absenteeism raised concern. 
However, local recruitment has also brought 
challenges, such as disadvantaged communities 
lacking competent applicants and having to rely 
on untrained teachers (UNESCO, 2014c).

Teach for America (TFA) is a programme that 
sends top college graduates to disadvantaged 
schools, partly to reduce teacher shortages but 
also to inspire good teaching and educational 
leadership. It expanded rapidly, from 500 teachers 
in 1999 to 10,000 in 2012/13. It has been found 
that, after gaining some experience, TFA teachers 
improve mathematics and science achievement 

in higher grade levels (Glazerman et al., 2006; 
Xu et al., 2009). However, they comprise only a 
tiny fraction of teachers in the United States, and 
just 28% of them remain in the profession after 
five years, compared with 50% of other teachers 
(Heilig and Jez, 2014). TFA cannot be seen as 
a long-term or sustainable solution, though it 
has expanded in developing countries, including 
Chile, India, Nepal, China and Peru.

Improved data and transparent management 
can help in implementing teacher deployment 
policies. Since 2003, the Rainbow Spectrum 
initiative in the Philippines has used a system 
of colour coding linked to pupil/teacher ratios 
to make disparity more visible: blue districts 
have ratios below 25:1, red indicates a ratio over 
50:1 and black signals a dire teacher shortage. 
The initiative has raised awareness of teacher 
deployment issues by making information more 
readily available and easily understandable. 
Between 2009 and 2011, over 60% of new 
teacher allocation went to black and red areas 
(Albert, 2012).

The use of contract teachers is increasing,  
but with concerns 

To respond to the need for teachers arising from 
increased enrolment, governments in some 
developing countries launched large-scale 
recruitment programmes involving widespread 
appointment of contract teachers. This approach 
often coincided with structural adjustment 
demands from international financial institutions 
requiring reductions in public sector spending 
(De Koning, 2013). These issues are further 
discussed in Chapter 8 on finance.

Trends in the composition of teaching forces 
show that by the late 2000s, some countries had 
far more teachers on temporary contracts than 
civil service teachers (Figure 6.10). In Niger, 
the percentage of contract teachers increased 
from 55% in 2002 to almost 80% in 2008. This 
trend has enabled the countries with the largest 
teacher shortages, including Benin and Mali, to 
significantly reduce pupil/teacher ratios.

In India, contract teacher recruitment has 
expanded rapidly since 2002, though with 
prominent variations among states. In 2013/14, 
47% of teachers in Jharkhand were on 
temporary contracts, compared with less than

2% in Karnataka (NUEPA, 2014). Proportions of 
contract teachers are also high in some Latin 
American countries, such as Chile, where until 
recently 20% of all teachers were contract 
teachers5 (Kingdon et al., 2013).

Contract teachers have poorer working 
conditions, job security and salaries than 
permanent teachers. They are more likely than 
civil servant teachers to have either no training 
or less than one month of training. In India, while 
regular teachers have to complete two years 
of initial teacher education, contract teachers 
are only required to undertake a short induction 
programme (Kingdon et al., 2013).

The stratification of teacher labour markets 
affects the way contract teachers are perceived 
and how they perceive themselves, leading to low 
morale, dissatisfaction and often high attrition 
(Chudgar et al., 2014). Benin implemented a 
policy to integrate contract teachers and regular 
teachers into one career stream (Pôle de Dakar 
and République du Bénin, 2011).

Can contract teachers be as effective as civil 
servant teachers? In Niger and Togo, contract 
teachers had an overall negative or mixed 
impact on learning achievement in grade 5 
French and mathematics, though in Mali it was 
positive (Bourdon et al., 2010). In India, learning 
outcomes did not differ overall between contract 
and regular teachers, and sometimes children 
taught by contract teachers did better (Atherton 
and Kingdon, 2010). Guinea shows that good 
management makes a difference: under a 
policy developed by the government and teacher 
unions, contract teachers received 18 months of 
training; their students generally outperformed 

those of regular teachers, and the teachers 
were significantly more qualified (Chudgar, 
forthcoming).

Contract teachers tend to be most effective when 
parental or community involvement is greater. 
In Kenya, positive effects from hiring contract 
teachers were observed only in communities 
where parents were trained to monitor teacher 
absenteeism and time on task, and relatives of 
local civil service teachers were prevented from 
being hired as contract teachers (Duflo et al., 
2012). In Mali, language and mathematics scores 
of grade 2 and 5 students were consistently 
higher under contract teachers closely 
monitored by the local community (Bourdon 
et al., 2010).

How can the status of teaching as a profession 
be improved?

When the teaching profession is of low status, 
this leads to difficulties in recruitment and 
retention. Improving the status of teaching 
is associated with better motivation and job 
satisfaction, which increases teacher retention 
and performance as well as student learning.

The 2013 Global Teacher Status Index illustrates 
stark differences across 21 countries. Teachers 
in China, Egypt, the Republic of Korea, Singapore 
and Turkey had higher status than those in 
countries of North America and Western Europe 
(except Greece). Less than 20% of people in 
Germany would encourage their child to become 
a teacher, compared with almost 40% in Turkey 
and 50% in China. Cultural issues explain some 
cross-country differences: teaching seems to

GOAL 6: QUALITY OF EDUCATIONInvesting in teachers is essentialbe treated with more reverence in some Asian 
societies (Dolton et al., 2013).

The status of teaching as a profession 
has declined (Keuren et al., 2014). 
Across 15 countries that participated in the 
Teaching and Learning International Survey, less 
than 33% of lower secondary teachers believed 
teaching to be a valued profession in society in 
2013, a substantial decrease from 60% in 2008 
(OECD, 2014l). 

Salaries have a direct impact on the 
attractiveness and prestige of teaching. In 
several sub-Saharan African countries, including 
Central African Republic, Guinea-Bissau and 
Liberia, teachers do not earn enough to lift their 
families above the poverty line (IIEP-Pôle de 
Dakar database). Over the past three decades, 
already low teacher pay declined across sub-
Saharan Africa, with the sharpest declines 
in Francophone Africa (Pôle de Dakar, 2009). 
When salaries are too low, teachers often need 
to take on additional work – including private 
tutoring (Box 6.2) – which can reduce their 
commitment to their regular teaching jobs and 
lead to absenteeism.

Teachers are paid less than people in 
professions requiring similar qualifications. In 
2012, primary school teachers in OECD countries 
earned 85% of the average for other full-time 
workers aged 25 to 64 with tertiary education, 
and lower secondary school teachers earned 
88% (OECD, 2014d). In Peru, other professionals 
of similar qualification and background earned 
50% more than pre-school and primary school 
teachers (Mizala and Ñopo, 2012). Teacher 
salaries were adversely affected by the global 
economic downturn in late 2008 – their average 
across OECD countries dropped by around 5% 
at all levels of education between 2009 and 2012 
(OECD, 2014d).

Some countries have taken steps to raise the 
status of the teaching profession. In Indonesia, 
under the 2005 Teacher Law, teachers are 
required to acquire a four year degree and be 
certified. Teachers who obtain certification 
then receive a professional allowance that 
doubles their salaries. Between 2006 and 2011, 
the percentage of primary teachers with a 
four year degree increased by 176%. The fivefold 
increase in enrolment in university education 
programmes, from 200,000 in 2005 to 1 million 

Box 6.2: The increase in private tutoring: 
What are the implications for policy-makers?

Private tutoring, long ingrained in East Asian countries, 
is now increasingly evident worldwide. In Azerbaijan and 
Georgia, over 80% of students report receiving some type 
of private tutoring in the last year of secondary school.

Private tutoring is generally associated with income-
generation activities among teachers seeking to 
supplement low salaries. In Cambodia, private tutoring is 
a common second occupation among primary and lower 
secondary teachers, especially in urban areas. Earnings 
from private tutoring can equal around two-thirds of the 
monthly average base salary with basic allowances.

Supplementary tutoring may interfere with the dynamics 
of teaching and learning, lead to the distortion of 
curriculum delivery and exacerbate inequality in student 
achievement. In Cambodia and Egypt, teachers are 
reported to withhold curriculum content during the school 
day, forcing students to attend tutorials where omitted 
subjects are covered.

Once private tutoring becomes widespread, it is very 
difficult to reverse with punitive measures. However, 
measures can be taken. In Bhutan, teachers were 
prohibited from providing supplementary tuition. China 
introduced penalties for teachers doing paid tutoring. 
Governments can reduce the high-stakes nature of 
assessment systems, which plays a role in driving demand 
for tutoring. Alternatively, they can improve supervision 
mechanisms to ensure that teachers cover the curriculum 
as expected. However, few countries have good data 
on this topic, and governments should increase the 
availability of data sources to allow the situation to be 
assessed and addressed.

(2012); Dawson (2009); Hartman (2013); Silova (2010).

in 2010, suggests that certification and higher 
income might have increased the attractiveness 
of the profession (Chang et al., 2014).

In high performing East Asian countries, 
induction programmes have been introduced to 
help new teachers cope with the practicalities of 
teaching, managing groups and adjusting to the 
school environment. Most programmes provide 
classroom release time6 for new teachers to 
participate in induction activities and allow for 
the training of mentor teachers. In Singapore, 
new primary teachers attend formal induction 

6. Classroom release time is when teachers are given time out of the 
classroom to do other work, such as planning, reporting and professional 
development, while another teacher covers their class.

levels and receive guidance from experienced 
mentors or senior teachers during their first 
two years (OECD, 2014l).

The success of teaching 
and learning is linked to 
available resources

The Dakar Framework identified the availability 
of textbooks and other instructional materials 
and facilities as key to improving education 
quality. This section focuses on three factors 
that support good quality teaching and learning: 
the supply, distribution and use of learning 
materials; a secure, accessible physical 
environment with appropriate facilities; and time 
spent in the classroom.

Widening the use of appropriate teaching 
and learning materials

Research on school effectiveness highlights 
the importance of appropriate textbooks in 
improving the quality of education. In developing 
countries with limited resources and constrained 
budgets, making textbooks available has been 
shown to be cost-effective (Boissiere, 2004; 
Scheerens, 2004).

Availability of textbooks remains 
severely limited

The pupil/textbook ratio is a significant 
measure of textbook availability. In 2012, 
Cameroon had only 1 reading textbook for every 
12 grade 2 students and only 1 mathematics 
textbook per 14 students, with no progress over 
time (UIS database). In secondary education, 
textbooks are also scarce. In an analysis 
of 19 sub-Saharan African countries, only 
Botswana had adequate textbook provision, 
close to a 1:1 ratio for all subjects and all 
grades. In the other 18 countries, including 
Lesotho, Mozambique and Zambia, secondary 
textbooks, particular in non-core subjects, were 
in very short supply (World Bank, 2008c).

There is marked variation by location. In Liberia 
in 2013, the pupil/textbook ratio in Margibi 
county was nearly 7:1, more than double the 
national average (Liberia Ministry of Education, 
2013). In South Sudan, the ratio ranged from 2:1 
in Central Equatoria state to 11:1 in Unity state 
(South Sudan Ministry of General Education and 
Instruction, 2012).

In several countries, textbook shortages have 
even become more acute over the past decade. 
Between 2000 and 2007, Kenya, Malawi, Namibia 
and Zimbabwe registered an increase of at 
least 10 percentage points in the proportion of 
students who either had no textbook or had to 
share with at least two other pupils. Swaziland, 
by contrast, witnessed an increase from 74% to 
99% in the percentage of students having sole 
use of a reading textbook, while accommodating 
an increase of around 20% in grade 6 enrolment 
rates (SACMEQ, 2010).

The availability of textbooks does not necessarily 
mean that they are used in the classroom. 
Textbooks may be kept in storage units for 
fear of damage or loss if they are turned over 
to students. In Malawi, it was reported that 
teachers were reluctant to let children use 
books because of lack of care or the risk that 
students would go absent or drop out (World 
Bank, 2012b). In Sierra Leone, uncertainty over 
future supplies has led to hoarding and non-use 
of textbooks (Sabarwal et al., 2013).

Textbook provision must be sustainable

A growing body of evidence confirming the 
critical role of textbooks in improving student 
achievement has influenced education policies. 
Swaziland has provided free textbooks to all 
primary school pupils since 2003 (SACMEQ, 
2011). The international community plays 
an important role in supporting textbook 
development and distribution in many developing 
countries. In Ethiopia, a project funded by the 
World Bank and assisted by USAID sought to 
improve the pupil/textbook ratio by distributing 
78 million textbooks to schools as well as 
textbooks and teacher guides in the seven 
mother tongues spoken by about 75% of primary 
students (World Bank, 2013c).

GOAL 6: QUALITY OF EDUCATIONThe success of teaching and learning is linked to available resourcesIn the 2000s, to make books more widely 
available, countries liberalized textbook 
provision and moved away from centralized 
procurement and distribution systems. A few 
sub-Saharan African countries, including Malawi 
and Zimbabwe, still depend entirely on state 
agencies to produce textbooks, but such systems 
are increasingly being replaced by public–private 
partnerships, with a shift in most countries 
towards local private sector involvement 
and marked growth of local, African-owned 
publishers (Read and Bontoux, 2014).7 Corruption 
and malpractice in textbook provision and 
distribution, which contribute to inefficiency, are 
being addressed by civil society organizations, as 
Chapter 8 shows for the Philippines.

Textbook content has been expanded 
and updated 

Textbooks, the most accessible part of the 
curriculum, reflect broad educational emphases 
and changes in them over time (Heyneman, 
2006). Thus, updating textbooks is important so 
they are aligned with the latest developments in 
education and subject areas.

Analyses of over 500 lower and upper secondary 
social science textbooks produced from 1970 to 
2008 in around 70 countries show interrelated 
trends. Discussion of human rights increased: 
about 20% of the textbooks before 1995 devoted 
a section or more to human rights, rising to 44% 
between 1995 and 2008, suggesting the impact of 
UN Decade for Human Rights Education (Meyer 
et al., 2010). In addition, textbooks became more 
student-centred by including child-friendly 
pictures, illustrative figures, open-ended 
discussion questions and role-playing exercises, 
a shift associated with the focus on children’s 
empowerment in global human rights treaties 
and organizations (Bromley et al., 2011a). Finally, 
under the influence of broad global cultural 
and environmental changes, the proportion of 
textbooks discussing environmental topics rose 
from 24% in 1970–1984 to 52% in 1995–2008 
(Bromley et al., 2011b).

Textbooks increasingly discuss the fact that 
women, children, immigrants and refugees, 
indigenous peoples and other minorities 
experience social discrimination, marginalization

Republic of Tanzania (DFID, 2011).

or exclusion. In addition to portraying social 
inequality, textbooks depict groups as having 
rights. Yet, despite this general trend towards 
representing the rights of marginalized groups, 
there is much to be done, particularly in some 
regions such as the Arab States concerning 
issues related to sexual orientation and workers’ 
rights (Terra and Bromley, 2012).

Fostering child-friendly 
school environments

One of the most important requirements for 
better quality in education is an improved learning 
environment, encompassing the physical school 
infrastructure and interaction between children 
and teachers. Many children go to school in 
conditions that are not conducive to learning – 
lacking potable water, handwashing facilities 
and safe, clean toilets. Children may also face 
discrimination, harassment and even violence.

In the past 15 years, several countries, including 
Nicaragua, Thailand and Uganda, have adopted a 
child-friendly school model that owes much to the 
work of United Nations bodies, especially UNICEF. 
The model, drawing its authority from the 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, emphasizes 
the school as a place that provides learning 
opportunities relevant to life and livelihood, in 
a healthy, safe environment that is inclusive 
and protective, is sensitive to gender equity and 
equality and involves the participation of students, 
families and communities (UNICEF, 2009a).

The model has offered an entry point for 
overcoming disadvantage and enhancing 
equity, as in the case of indigenous children 
in Belize and ethnic minorities in the former 
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (UNICEF, 
2013c). In the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, 
the Schools of Quality approach, adopted by 
at least 20% of primary schools by 2011, led 
to higher enrolment and retention and lower 
repetition rates, particularly in underserved rural 
areas (McLaughlin, 2011).

Evaluation of child-friendly schools based on 
site visits in Guyana, Nicaragua, Nigeria, the 
Philippines, South Africa and Thailand highlighted 
challenges to effective implementation of the 
model. Poor school infrastructure and lack 
of maintenance are major problems. In the 
Philippines, only 32% of schools were in good 
physical condition – without broken windows or

buildings and classrooms were not adequate to 
serve students with physical disabilities and in 
fewer than one-third of schools were teachers 
trained to work with students with learning and 
physical disabilities. Moreover, school heads 
and teachers found the shift to child-centred 
pedagogical approaches demanding due to a lack 
of training (UNICEF, 2009b).

Making every minute count in the classroom

While the Dakar Framework does not explicitly 
refer to it, instructional time has been shown 
to enhance learners’ exposure to knowledge 
and result in significant learning gains. In Chile, 
where the government gradually lengthened 
the school day, high school students under a 
full school day regime had higher achievement 
levels in language and mathematics than their 
peers under a shorter regime (Bellei, 2009). In 
Ethiopia, a longer school day (changed in 2005 
from four to six hours) improved writing and 
mathematics scores of 8-year-olds (though 
not in reading), with a larger impact for girls 
than boys – albeit leading to increased learning 
gaps between poorer and wealthier students 
(Orkin, 2013).

International agencies and reports have 
recommended that primary schools operate 
between 850 and 1,000 hours per year, or about 
200 days, assuming a five-day school week 
(Lockheed and Verspoor, 1991). In 2014 in OECD 
countries, intended instruction time for primary 
students averaged almost 800 hours per year 
and ranged from less than 700 hours in Hungary 
to around 1,000 hours in Chile and Portugal 
(OECD, 2014d).

and World Database on Education, 7th edition.

The time allocated for classroom instruction 
in primary and lower secondary education 
worldwide has slightly declined over the past 
decade and is below 1,000 hours, a new GMR 
team analysis shows (Figure 6.11). In the 
late 2000s, countries mandated an average of 
720 hours of instructional time per year in the 
early primary grades, increasing in subsequent 
grades to reach about 900 hours in grade 8. 
Significant increases in instructional time tend 
to occur from grade 2 to 3, and again from grade 
6 to 7, when the transition between primary and 
lower secondary education typically takes place.

Analysis of the most recent data available for 
125 countries shows that in the early grades 
of primary education, the median number of 
instructional hours is higher in North America 
and Western Europe, Latin America and the 
Caribbean, East Asia and the Pacific, and 
South and West Asia, and lower in the Arab States, 
Central Asia, Central and Eastern Europe and, to 
a lesser extent, sub-Saharan Africa. Wide regional 
differences in intended instructional time during 
the early grades are less evident in later grades. 
There is comparatively little regional variation by 
the lower secondary level (Figure 6.12).

Official intended instructional time is not the 
same as actual learning time

In many countries, especially in schools in poor 
communities, schools days are lost due to late 
teacher postings, in-service teacher training, 
strikes and armed conflict (Benavot and Gad, 
2004). In Brazil (Pernambuco state), Ghana, 
Morocco and Tunisia, instructional time losses 
ranged from 39% to 78% of the official intended 
instructional time (Abadzi, 2007).

Teacher absenteeism takes a toll on student 
learning by reducing the number of hours that 
children are actually taught. One-third of pupils 
in Argentina, Paraguay and the Philippines 
reported problems with teachers’ late arrival, 
absenteeism and skipping class (UIS, 2008). 
Estimates for 21 countries for 2004–2011 
indicate that the teacher absenteeism rate in 
primary education exceeded 20% in Ghana, India, 
Kenya, Senegal and Uganda (Patrinos, 2013).

The actual time available for instruction is 
further shaped by how teachers and students 
use time during class. In Ethiopia’s Oromo 
region, classroom observations in lower primary

but also on

schools showed that around two-thirds of 
students were not actively engaged in learning 
(DeStefano and Elaheebocus, 2010). In Uganda, 
with primary teacher absenteeism of 27%, many 
teachers who were in the classroom were not 
actually teaching (Chaudhury et al., 2006).

Loss of instructional time and its inefficient use 
are indications of poor education quality, making 
private schooling more attractive to parents 
than government schools in many countries (see 
Chapter 2). Quality school time in which teachers 
and pupils are actively engaged in learning 
activities needs to be maximized by improving 
central and regional supervision, documenting 
the prevalence of ghost teachers, giving teachers 
and principals training and feedback on the 
use of time, and empowering communities to 
monitor teacher activities better.

Teaching and learning 
processes matter for learning

A good quality education depends on not 
just inputs, but also on processes. The 
Dakar Framework urged improvement of 
teaching and learning practices. There are 
four aspects involved: a curriculum that 
is relevant and inclusive; an effective and 
appropriate pedagogical approach; the use 
of children’s mother tongues; and the use of 
appropriate technology.

Developing a relevant curriculum

Curriculum reform has both global and local 
influences. The Dakar Framework influenced 
the New Curriculum Reform in China, launched 

in 2001 and implemented in 2005 (China 
Government, 2003); national EFA strategies 
included reform in sub-Saharan African 
countries, including Angola, Botswana, Burundi, 
Congo, Mauritius, Mozambique and South Africa 
(Georgescu et al., 2009). In Turkey, the primary 
education curriculum was revised in 2004 to 
respond to changes in the labour market; also, 
as a candidate for European Union membership, 
Turkey had a clear political motive in its adoption 
of EU standards and educational perspective 
(Altinyelken and Akkaymak, 2012).

Curriculum reform has also been legitimized 
by growing pressure to improve economic 
competitiveness. Consequently, there has been 
increasing convergence in the ways governments 
have reformed curricula (Fiala, 2007), often with 
less focus on content knowledge and more on 
skills and competencies (Rosenmund, 2007).

Another aspect of curriculum reform has been 
a drive to make content more relevant to the 
contemporary needs of individuals, communities 
and societies (Barrett et al., 2007). International 
discourse and priorities, especially regarding 
sustainable development and environmental 
protection, have been influential. Analysis of 
official timetables between the 1980s and 2000s 
indicates that environment-related topics, such 
as pollution, depletion of natural resources and 
the ozone layer, have formed a new subject area, 
particularly in primary grades. The prevalence 
of subjects related to computers and technology 
also substantially increased: they were found in 
25% of timetables in primary grades and 40% in 
lower secondary grades (Benavot, 2004). A recent 
rapid assessment found that among 88 countries 
analysed, 51 emphasized technology use in their 
national curricula (Amadio, 2014).

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 61025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportEmphasizing skills and competencies

In the early 2000s, curriculum was content-
driven, often criticized as too theoretical, out 
of date and overloaded. After Dakar, a shift in 
education policies towards the development 
of competencies and skills was pervasive 
(Westbrook et al., 2013). In China, where science 
education traditionally focused on transmitting 
and acquiring knowledge, the 2001 curriculum 
required students to develop inquiry, creativity, 
problem solving, critical thinking and the ability 
to apply science to real-life situations (Guo 
et al., 2013). In Turkey, the 2004 curriculum 
adopted a competency-based approach instead 
of the traditional knowledge-based curriculum, 
emphasizing skills such as communication, 
inquiry, entrepreneurship and the use of 
information technology (Altinyelken and 
Akkaymak, 2012).

The move towards competency-based curricula 
generally occurred in lower primary grades, with 
the secondary level moving to more structured 
learning. In Uganda’s 2007 thematic curriculum, 
knowledge and competencies were organized 
around themes for the lower three grades while 
a subject-based curriculum was adopted in 
upper grades (NCDC, 2006).

Countries diversified secondary education 
curricula to make them more relevant to the 
world of work (see Chapter 3). Botswana, Ghana 
and South Africa reformed their education 
systems to offer a core lower secondary 
curriculum to all learners (Afeti et al., 2008; 
World Bank, 2008b), allowing schools to focus 
on core skills, including literacy and numeracy, 
while offering extracurricular activities to meet 
students’ wider needs and interests.

At the upper secondary level, many developing 
countries moved quickly to make technical and 
vocational subjects a key curriculum component. 
Colombia revised its secondary school 
curriculum so rural youth could gain knowledge 
in agriculture, animal husbandry and other rural 
activities through traditional subjects, such as 
mathematics and sciences, in ways that made 
sense to them (IFAD, 2010).

Some countries decentralized curriculum 
design to enable inclusion of activities and 
knowledge seen as useful and appropriate to 

the lives of particular groups of children. In 
2004, Mozambique implemented a new basic 
education curriculum adjusted to local needs, 
with 20% of the content designed by schools 
and communities (Alderuccio, 2010; Chachuaio 
and Dhorsan, 2008). The Plurinational State 
of Bolivia introduced a new national (60%), 
regional (30%) and local (10–20%) curriculum 
in 2010 that aimed to fully include indigenous 
people in the education system and improve 
their educational outcomes, and where regional 
and local curriculum cater to specific regional 
and local contexts including indigenous culture 
(Altinyelken, 2015).

Curriculum reform was not always successful  
in meeting its goals

Implementation of curriculum reform varied 
widely around the world (Anderson-Levitt, 
2003). It was influenced by resources, including 
the availability of textbooks and well-trained 
teachers, and the support of teachers. In several 
countries, curriculum implementation was 
expected to automatically follow the processes 
of curriculum design and writing (Georgescu et 
al., 2009). Serious setbacks are encountered if 
curriculum reform contradicts existing policy. In 
Turkey, examination practices were not aligned 
with curriculum objectives, entrenching the 
perception that schooling was not enough to 
guarantee educational success and leading 
to increased demand for private tutoring 
(Altinyelken, 2013).

In some curriculum reforms, skills or 
competencies were considered to be in 
opposition to knowledge. In China, while the 
previous curriculum was felt to be overloaded 
with facts and subjects, the revised one was 
criticized as too light, omitting significant 
information. As a result, teachers supplemented 
it with information from other sources, 
increasing their workload (Dello-Iacovo, 2009). 
In rural secondary schools in Peru, teachers 
understood a new emphasis on outcomes to 
indicate that content was no longer important, 
leading to students missing out on key concepts 
(Balarin and Benavides, 2010).

In many cases, teachers were not involved 
in curriculum planning, leaving them 
disempowered by a top-down process. They 
lacked an understanding of the reforms’

in classroom reality (Al-Daami and Wallace, 
2007). In Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Senegal, Uganda 
and the United Republic of Tanzania, teachers 
often did not understand the objectives of the 
curricula, partly due to a mismatch with teacher 
training and a lack of support mechanisms in the 
classroom (Pryor et al., 2012).

Adopting effective teaching strategies

Teaching strategies are increasingly recognized 
as central in improving education quality. A 
synthesis of over 800 meta-analyses of pedagogy 
in high income countries identified interactive 
classroom strategies, such as reciprocal 
teaching, peer tutoring, student verbalization 
and feedback, as the factors most likely to 
help children learn (Hattie, 2012). A systematic 
review of 489 studies and an in-depth study of 
54 empirical studies in low and middle income 
countries highlighted various effective pedagogic 
strategies: group and pair work, informative 
feedback, student questioning, use of local 
languages, the planning and varying of lesson 
sequences and use of a range of learning 
materials (Westbrook et al., 2013).

Specific pedagogic practices were linked 
with positive student achievement. In rural 
India, child-friendly practices, such as 
asking questions, using local examples to 
explain lessons and working in small groups, 
were positively correlated with test scores 
in standards 2 and 4 (Bhattacharjea et al., 
2011). In Pakistan, a school-based survey in 
Lahore district of Punjab province in 2002/03 
found that lesson planning and interactive 
teaching increased language and mathematics 
achievement, especially in private schools 
(Aslam and Kingdon, 2011).

Moving towards a learner-centred pedagogy

In many developing countries, teaching 
practices follow a rigid chalk-and-talk, teacher-
dominated, lecture-driven and rote-learning 
pedagogy, as noted in classroom observations 
in Bangladesh (World Bank, 2013a), Lesotho 
(Moloi et al., 2008), Myanmar (Lall, 2011) and 
Nigeria (Hardman et al., 2008). Such pedagogy 
places students in a passive role, limiting their 
activity to memorizing facts and reciting them 
to the teacher.

The past decade has seen a move away from 
teacher-dominated instructional practices 
to learner-centred pedagogy.8 This approach 
promotes critical thinking, with teachers 
expected to help students actively construct 
knowledge through activities, group work and 
reflection. It emerged partly from the view, 
shared by some international organizations 
and national policy-makers, that such an 
approach would help promote democracy, civic 
engagement and economic development – for 
example, in Botswana (Tabulawa, 2003), Egypt 
(Ginsburg and Megahed, 2008), Guatemala (De 
Baessa et al., 2002), India (Sriprakash, 2010) and 
Namibia (O’Sullivan, 2004).

Challenges in effective implementation 
in classrooms

A range of issues makes implementation 
of learner-centred pedagogy in classrooms 
difficult and challenging. A review of 72 
articles published between 1981 and 2010 on 
learner-centred pedagogy identified challenges 
related to a lack of supportive environment, 
teacher training and preparation, textbooks, 
teaching materials, class size and furniture 
(Schweisfurth, 2011).

In Turkey, in primary schools in Ankara province, 
a lack of resources in classes of over 30 students 
impeded implementation (Altinyelken, 2011). In 
Uganda, primary school teachers in Kampala 
changed classroom layouts in response to 
promotion of learner-centred pedagogy in the 
new curriculum, but most found it difficult 
to place students in groups in overcrowded 
classrooms or to carry out meaningful pair or 
group activities (Altinyelken, 2010).

The move towards learner-centred pedagogy 
has significant implications for initial teacher 
education and ongoing training (see Box 6.3). 
Without sustained and coherent support, 
teachers largely teach the way they were taught. 
In Central Asia,9 many teachers were unprepared 
or ill-prepared to overcome the challenges 

8. Among countries adopting such pedagogical approaches were Cambodia 
and China in East Asia and the Pacific; the Russian Federation in Central and 
Eastern Europe; Botswana, Ethiopia, Guinea, Malawi, Namibia, South Africa 
and the United Republic of Tanzania in sub-Saharan Africa; Egypt and Jordan 
in the Arab States; and Brazil, El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua in Latin 
America and the Caribbean (Altinyelken, 2015).

et al., 2005).

Another challenge in implementation is the 
unintended consequences of high-stakes 
examinations: their ‘backwash effect’10 
(Altinyelken, 2015). Where national examination 
results determine pupils’ life chances and 
schools’ and teachers’ reputations, and 
examinations test learners’ ability to recall 
or recognize factual knowledge, this drives 
teacher practice and parental and pupil 
expectations. Formative assessments need to 
be supplemented by other forms of evaluations 
that recognize lessons from learner-centred 
pedagogy (Akyeampong et al., 2006).

In Chinese secondary schools, teachers 
perceived examination preparation to be their 

Box 6.3: Flexible school-based teacher 
training helped improve pedagogical 
practices in Kenya

Kenya has made great strides in the number of children 
entering and completing primary school while also 
improving learning outcomes. This progress may have 
been facilitated by programmes helping teachers adopt 
effective pedagogic approaches.

A school-based development programme ran from 
2001–2006 for 47,000 primary school teachers in 
English, mathematics and science, combining six months 
of self-study, based on distance-learning materials, with 
school-based professional development. Three key 
resource teachers from every school were trained to lead 
professional development in their subject. Head teachers 
received training materials to support the key resource 
teachers in providing training.

Follow-up evaluations indicated positive changes in 
classroom interactions. Lesson observations in grades 
3 and 6 showed that 34% of teachers in 2005 used 
paired and group work, compared with 3% in 1999. 
Also, a greater range of arrangements was used to alter 
classroom layouts to meet the requirements of various 
kinds of learning tasks.

This experience shows that field-based models, made up 
of school-based training supported by distance learning 
materials, school clusters and follow-up in the classroom, 
can help close the gap between theory and practice and 
raise the quality of teaching practices.

primary responsibility; few were willing to 
experiment with new approaches (Fang and 
Clarke, 2014). In Jordan, teachers received in-
service training to promote critical thinking and 
problem solving by encouraging students’ active 
participation. Yet only limited change occurred, 
partly because the Tawjihi, the secondary school 
graduation examination on which admission 
to university depends, still emphasized rote 
learning (Dakkak, 2011; World Bank, 2011a).

Cultural factors provide another explanation 
for failure to implement learner-centred 
approaches. In sub-Saharan African countries, 
including Ethiopia and Namibia, the basic tenets 
of learner-centred pedagogy may conflict with 
local understanding of authority structures, 
obedience and teacher–student relationships 
(O’Sullivan, 2004; Serbessa, 2006). In East Asian 
countries, teacher-dominated pedagogy prevails, 
as it is considered compatible with societies that 
value respect for authority (Nguyen et al., 2006).

Yet by adapting new teaching strategies to local 
contexts, teachers can create a learner-centred 
environment even in adverse circumstances. In 
the United Republic of Tanzania, primary school 
teachers adapted pedagogy to the needs of 
various groups by using a mix of traditional and 
reform-oriented practices, even in large classes 
(Barrett, 2007).

A range of teaching practices exists, and 
planners and policy-makers should be cautious 
about setting up a rigid dichotomy between 
teacher-centred and learner-centred pedagogy, 
since teachers rarely use one approach to 
the exclusion of the other. Teachers vary their 
practices throughout their careers as well as in 
daily work, where a single lesson may include 
both direct, teacher-led instruction and more 
learner-centred approaches (Vavrus et al., 2011).

Shifting towards a multilingual 
language policy

Most countries in the world are bilingual or 
multilingual. Language is of considerable 
importance for the quality of teaching and 
learning, in terms of both the language of 
instruction and languages taught in school. But 
language policy in education is intimately related 
to history and relationships of power. Colonization 
left a deep imprint. In sub-Saharan Africa,

GOAL 6: QUALITY OF EDUCATIONTeaching and learning processes matter for learningthere has been a general trend towards more 
widespread use of local languages. At the time of 
independence, only 20 out of 47 African countries 
used local languages in primary education, 
whereas 38 now do so, influenced by advocacy 
from local actors (Albaugh, 2007).

In most sub-Saharan African countries, including 
Botswana, Mozambique and Swaziland, the early-
exit transitional model was most common. This 
model uses the local language as the medium 
of instruction in the first two or three years of 
primary education to prepare for the introduction 
of a European or other official language. Ethiopia 
is an exception: learners’ mother tongues are 
to be used for literacy and learning to the end 
of grade 8, with the teaching of Amharic and 
English as subjects (Brylinski & Koseleci, 2015).

Wider use of local languages is also apparent in 
much of Southeast Asia. Cambodia, Malaysia and 
Thailand are gradually moving towards mother-
tongue-based bilingual education. In Latin 
America, most countries, including Guatemala, 
Paraguay and Peru, have intercultural bilingual 
education policies that aim to integrate 
indigenous languages into national education 
by allowing children to learn in their mother 
tongue before moving on to Spanish (Brylinski & 
Koseleci, 2015).

Language policy in education raises complex 
issues and potential tensions between group 
identity, on the one hand, and social and 
economic aspirations on the other. Attempts 
to use local languages in education often meet 
stiff resistance from parents and educators, 
who view local languages as offering insufficient 
opportunity for educational advancement and of 
little use to gain employment (Altinyelken, 2015).

In India, parents express a strong preference for 
their children to go to private schools to learn 
in English, seen as a route to better job and life 
opportunities (Nambissan, 2012). In Nigeria, 
the synthetic phonics approach allows children 
to master their mother tongue and English 
at the same time, so parents, children and 
teachers do not have to choose between them 
(Cooke, 2014). In Pakistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 
province decided from April 2014 to make 
English the medium of instruction to align with 
private education offerings. However, research 

by ASER Pakistan (2012) showed that only 16% 
of parents preferred English over Urdu (39%) 
or Pashto (45%). Teachers and students also 
complained about the challenges imposed by the 
requirement to teach in English (Rahim, 2014).

The language of instruction matters for 
education quality

Language can be a factor of disadvantage 
for children marginalized by instruction in a 
language they do not understand. The degree of 
alignment between home and school language 
has a critical bearing on learning opportunities. 
In Congo, almost 80% of grade 5 students 
who speak the test language at home achieve 
minimum learning in reading, but 7 out of 
10 students speak another language and their 
achievement rate is 60% (Altinok, 2013b).

Language often interacts with culture and 
poverty to increase the risk of being left behind. 
Among poor rural grade 6 students in Guatemala 
who speak a minority (usually indigenous) 
language at home, only 47% reach the minimum 
achievement level in mathematics, but 88% of 
rich urban students speaking Spanish reach that 
level (Altinok, 2013b). 

Disadvantage associated with language and 
poverty continues into secondary school. New 
analysis by the GMR team shows that in Turkey, 
15-year-olds speaking a non-Turkish language, 
predominantly Kurdish, were among the lowest 
performers in the PISA 2012 assessment: 
around 50% of poor non-Turkish speakers 
achieved minimum learning benchmarks in 
reading, against the national average of 80%.11

A strong body of evidence suggests that 
children’s participation in well-designed 
multilingual programmes can improve learning 
in their mother tongue, as well as in a more 
widely used national or regional language, in 
subjects across the curriculum. In Ethiopia, 
grade 8 pupils learning in their mother tongue 
performed better in mathematics, biology, 
chemistry and physics than pupils in English-
only schooling (Heugh et al., 2007). The benefits 
of bilingual programmes extend beyond

and self-esteem. In Burkina Faso, mother 
tongue instruction facilitated the use of effective 
teaching practices in the classroom and 
encouraged learners to be active and become 
involved with the subject matter (Nikiema, 2011).

Six to eight years of education in a language 
are necessary to develop the level of literacy 
and verbal proficiency required for academic 
achievement. Country studies suggest that 
multilingual education needs to be sustained 
over this length of time to sustain improved 
learning for children and reduce learning gaps. 
In Cameroon, early exit from a mother-tongue 
environment prevented pupils from sustaining 
learning gains (Walter and Chuo, 2012).

Despite evidence on the benefits of multilingual 
education, its effective implementation is 
complex and challenging. Among the biggest 
obstacles to using local languages in the 
classroom are a lack of textbooks and a shortage 
of trained teachers using the languages. The 
cost of addressing these needs to be weighed 
against the social, political and economic cost 
of low levels of learning achievement from 
continued monolingual policies (Aikman, 2015).

Deploying technology to support learning

Integrating technology-rich learning 
environments into education systems is one 
of the newest challenges policy-makers have 
faced since Dakar. Older technology continues 
to play an important role in improving learning 
and narrowing gaps in achievement for children 
in isolated or underserved settings, while the 
expansion of information and communication 
technology (ICT) has promoted the use of 
pedagogical innovations.

Older technology remains cost-effective

Radio programming is an enduring and 
successful example of technology use, in 
particular for children in isolated or underserved 
settings. Since the 1970s, interactive radio 
instruction has been used to enrich teaching 
processes by introducing interactive learning 
activities, such as song, movement and role 
playing (Ho and Thukral, 2009).

Over the past decade, a resurgence of interactive 
radio instruction has helped counteract poor 
resources, inadequate teacher training and 
low levels of learner achievement. A review 
of 15 projects since the early 2000s shows 
they improved learning outcomes in a range 
of developing countries, in particular for early 
grade pupils in hard-to-reach communities and 
schools in fragile states (Ho and Thukral, 2009). 
The South Sudan Interactive Radio Instruction 
Project reached over 473,000 pupils in grades 
1 to 4 between 2006 and 2010 with half-hour 
lessons linked to the national curriculum, and 
provided 55,000 out-of-school adolescents with 
non-formal accelerated learning on the primary 
school curriculum (Leigh and Epstein, 2012).

Integrating ICT into education systems to 
improve learning

Education policies regarding ICT in the early 
2000s have called for establishing computer 
laboratories in schools, acquiring equipment 
and networks and providing teacher training and 
support. In high income countries, this trend 
is reflected in the improving ratio of students 
to computers. Between 2000 and 2009, the 
learner/computer ratio12 in schools attended by 
15-year-olds dropped significantly in most OECD 
countries, including Austria, Belgium, the Czech 
Republic, Japan and Norway (OECD, 2011b).

In developing countries, computer resources 
remain greatly overstretched, especially in 
primary schools. According to data from the UIS 
database, in Egypt, Nepal and the Philippines, 
over 100 learners share a single computer at 
the primary level. Wide disparities exist within 
countries (UIS database, 2014). In China, the 
primary learner/computer ratio in rural areas 
is 29:1, twice that in urban areas (14:1) (Zeng 
et al., 2012).

In Latin America and the Caribbean, various 
programmes provide inexpensive computers to 
poor children. Uruguay has achieved a universal 
1:1 learner/computer ratio: 362,000 students 
and 18,000 teachers in public schools had their 
own portable computer by 2009; all primary 
teachers received training and had access to an

al., 2011). However, the program has not been 
found to significantly improve mathematics and 
reading scores (de Melo et al., 2014).

Mixed evidence on the use of ICT to improve 
education quality

ICT has the potential to enhance teaching and 
learning in many ways – such as presentation, 
demonstration, drill and practice, interaction 
and collaboration – that are more interactive and 
participatory than traditional modes (Haddad 
and Draxler, 2002). But despite enthusiasm, 
studies have been equivocal as to the impact of 
its increasing availability on learning.

In the United States, greater ICT availability 
had no impact on test scores in 15 California 
schools (Fairlie and Robinson, 2013). In Brazil, 
the introduction of computer laboratories 
had a negative impact on the acquisition of 
mathematics and reading skills in grade 8, 
though teachers’ use of internet to support 
classroom teaching led to improved test scores, 
especially in mathematics (Sprietsma, 2012). 
In Peru, the One Laptop per Child programme 
had no impact on test scores in mathematics 
and language, but improved verbal fluency, 
abstract reasoning and processing speed (Cristia 
et al., 2012).

Effective deployment and use of technology 
in schools can sometimes help balance 
unequal access to ICT at home and can narrow 
educational and social gaps. A small-scale one-
to-one laptop programme in low income areas of 
Tel Aviv provided guided and interactive learning 
activities aligned with the national curriculum. 
Grade 5 pupils studying in a technology-rich 
learning environment had significantly higher 
learning gains in mathematics, Hebrew and 
English than pupils taught in a traditional setting 
(Rosen and Manny-Ikan, 2011).

In migrant schools in suburban areas of Beijing, 
One Laptop per Child had a positive impact on 
computer skills and mathematics scores of 

grade 3 students, especially for those with no 
or little previous experience with computers. 
Children were trained to use remedial tutoring 
software and given the opportunity to practise 
using it with their parents at their side (Mo 
et al., 2013).

Availability of ICT infrastructure remains a 
crucial consideration

Effective integration of ICT into education 
systems is complex, relating to infrastructure, 
teacher competencies, pedagogy, institutional 
readiness, curriculum and sustained financial 
resources. Many countries cannot support 
widespread computer-assisted learning, simply 
because schools lack internet access or, in some 
cases, electricity supply. In Nepal, only 6% of 
primary schools and 24% of secondary schools 
have electricity (UIS, 2014a).

ICT effectiveness depends on trained teachers 
who can use it to maximize teaching and 
learning. In Oman, only 6% of teachers are 
trained to teach basic computer skills or 
computing; in Egypt the share is 2% (UIS, 2013a).

A lack of links to national curriculum is also 
an obstacle. The Enlaces programme in Chile 
equipped public primary and secondary schools 
with computers, local networks, and educational 
and productivity software, and provided ongoing 
technical and pedagogical support. However, 
ICT was not sufficiently well integrated into 
the curriculum, with teachers failing to use 
it in everyday teaching to encourage effective 
problem-solving skills in students (Sanchez and 
Salinas, 2008).

Mobile learning: A promising path?

The development of mobile phones, wireless 
technology and portable audio players has 
opened up a huge array of possibilities for 
acquiring literacy and numeracy skills. Mobile 
phones arguably have the greatest potential 
for ICT-based learning, since they do not 
require the same level of infrastructure as

and many devices have internet access and 
video capabilities.

The decentralization of 
education governance

The power to extend educational experiences 
beyond classrooms and enable non-formal and 
informal learning is a key attribute of mobile 
learning (see Chapter 3). Mobile learning 
initiatives have the potential to become 
a resource for teachers and students in 
Latin America and the Caribbean (Lugo and 
Schurmann, 2012) and in the Arab States and 
sub-Saharan Africa (Isaacs, 2012).

In the United Republic of Tanzania, the BridgeIT 
programme allows teachers to download videos 
on subjects such as science and mathematics on 
a mobile phone and transfer them to a television 
in the classroom. The programme led to 
improvement in grade 5 students’ mathematics 
and science scores and in classroom interaction, 
with students asking more questions and 
working together (Enge, 2011).

The MoMath Project in South Africa, started 
in 2007, uses mobile phones to give grade 10 
students access to mathematics content and 
support. The content, aligned with the national 
curriculum, is freely available to participating 
learners and teachers who received appropriate 
training. By the end of 2011, the project had 
reached 25,000 learners, 500 teachers and 
172 schools in four provinces (Isaacs, 2012). It 
led to a 14% increase in mathematics skills, with 
a majority of learners using the application even 
over holidays and weekends (McCormack, 2010).

Despite insufficiently rigorous monitoring and 
evaluation, key principles to enhance teaching 
and learning through mobile learning initiatives 
have been identified, such as designing mobile 
applications with the clear purpose of teaching 
and learning, ensuring equality of access to 
all learners, involving teachers from design 
to implementation and review, considering 
sustainability, ensuring maintenance and 
financing at the project’s beginning, and 
involving all stakeholders (Unwin, 2015). 

The decentralization of education governance 
has become more common since 2000. This 
principle was reflected nowhere more clearly 
than in the Dakar Framework, which called for a 
move from highly centralized, standardized and 
command-driven forms of management to more 
decentralized and participatory decision-making, 
implementation and monitoring at lower levels 
of accountability. It was hoped that improving 
education governance would, in turn, improve 
equality of education in general.

Reforms in education governance before the 
2000s were often part of wider decentralization. 
The many factors underlying decentralization 
agendas included reducing national budgets 
by transferring costs to regional and local 
governments, dismantling large and costly 
bureaucracies, satisfying political demands for 
democratization, giving citizens more voice in 
shaping public resource allocation and defusing 
ethnic and regional tensions by allowing greater 
autonomy (Litvack et al., 1998).

International development agencies were 
influential in pushing for decentralization. 
Supported by internationally accepted views 
about the desirability of decentralization, 
national policy-makers designed and undertook 
reform with substantial financial and technical 
support from international agencies. 

Attempts to decentralize authority and 
responsibility in education were also motivated 
by the perceived failure of central governments to 
provide high quality education. Over the past few 
decades, the education sector has been fertile 
ground for decentralization. Most countries have 
transferred responsibility away from central 
government (UNESCO, 2009a). The transfer has 
taken various forms, including assigning tasks to 
lower levels within ministries, devolving decision-
making to elected representatives at subnational 
levels and investing authority and responsibility in 
schools and communities.

213

GOAL 6: QUALITY OF EDUCATIONThe decentralization of education governanceHowever, education systems may limit this 
process. In primary education, most central 
governments transfer authority in some 
areas but continue to play a significant role 
in others (UNESCO, 2009a). In Cambodia, 
China, Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, 
national or subnational governments set lower 
secondary curriculum content, instructional time 
and teacher salaries, and allocate resources 
to schools, but leave the choice of teaching 
methods and support activities for students to 
schools (King and Cordeiro Guerra, 2005).

Furthermore, decentralization is a highly 
political process. In Nepal, its implementation 
was difficult: challenges included schools 
lacking the necessary financial and technical 
capacity, parents and communities feeling 
disempowered and accountability being weak. 
In China, decentralization contributed to 
inequity by generating major geographical and 
income-based disparity in per-student spending 
(UNESCO, 2009a).

Major decentralization trends 
following Dakar

Three interrelated decentralization trends have 
been identified since Dakar (Channa, 2014). 
First, even in countries that undertook major 
decentralization in the 1990s, reforms are still 
being consolidated and strengthened. Several 
countries are addressing challenges such as 
misaligned incentives, lack of capacity and 
training, and weak or stalled implementation. 
In Brazil and in India’s Andhra Pradesh and 
Karnataka states, new laws were passed to 
enforce local fiscal responsibility. The Russian 
Federation moved to formula-based grants 
to improve transparency and reduce political 
interference.

Second, school-based management, the 
furthest-reaching form of decentralization, 
has been a popular strategy, implemented 
in diverse contexts and forms. School-based 
management typically involves establishing a 
school committee or council – including the 
principal, teachers, parents, local leaders and 
other community members – that is usually 
tasked with monitoring school performance 
and providing oversight on resource use. 
Less frequently, it is granted authority over 
teacher recruitment, curriculum and school 

budget allocation. These programmes have 
often extended broader decentralization 
interventions. Mexico’s decentralization in 
1992 was followed by its biggest school-based 
management programme, Programa Escuela 
de Calidad, in 2001 (Skoufias and Shapiro, 2006). 
In the Philippines, the Big Bang reform in the 
1990s was supplemented with school-based 
management programmes in the early 2000s 
(Channa, 2014).

Finally, an increasing number of decentralization 
initiatives have been in sub-Saharan African 
countries, including Benin, Chad and Kenya. In 
Congo and Sierra Leone, the end of civil wars 
in the early 2000s prompted renewed interest in 
decentralization. In Rwanda, stability after the 
1994 genocide allowed the country to embark 
on decentralization in the 2000s. Ethiopia and 
the United Republic of Tanzania deepened 
governance reforms and launched initiatives 
to strengthen capacity in existing programmes 
(Channa, 2014).

Mixed record on equitable learning

Decentralization is seen as a strategy to 
improve quality by bringing decision-making 
closer to local communities and strengthening 
accountability mechanisms between schools and 
the parents and children they serve. While the 
promised benefits were enticing, implementation 
has been uneven. A few isolated attempts to 
identify the impact of reforms that shift power 
or resources to lower tiers of government have 
been made, but it is a complex task.13

In Argentina, Spanish and mathematics scores 
had increased significantly at the secondary level 
after five years of decentralized administration, 
but only in schools in better-off municipalities, 
leading to increased inequality (Galiani et al., 
2008). In the Russian Federation, 1994 reforms 
passed more responsibility and autonomy to 
local governments and gave them some control 
over health and education spending. Fiscal 
decentralization did not increase secondary 
education resources or utilities provision, but 
led to significantly better average regional 
scores on national examinations in language and 
mathematics, a result attributed to strengthened 

13. When a reform is implemented everywhere simultaneously, there is no 
possibility of adopting a rigorous evaluation research design.

(Freinkman and Plekhanov, 2010).

teaching and learning, or to engage in effective 
evaluation, are few (World Bank, 2010d).

There is better information on the relationship 
between school-based management and 
learning outcomes (Bruns et al. 2012; Channa 
and Faguet, 2012), though only a handful of 
studies had a randomized design to distinguish 
the impact on learning outcomes from other 
factors. In Kenya, well-trained and empowered 
school committees, consisting of teachers and 
parents and tasked specifically with managing 
teachers, were found to improve primary 
school students’ language and mathematics 
scores in smaller classes (Duflo et al., 2012). 
In the Gambia, the Whole School Development 
programme significantly reduced student and 
teacher absenteeism but improved test scores 
only in areas with high adult literacy rates 
(Blimpo and Evans, 2011).

Enabling environments are important

Devolving authority to schools shifts decision-
making and other responsibility to parents, 
teachers and principals. Yet upper levels 
of government still have a role in ensuring 
positive results. They need to focus their 
efforts on schools with disadvantaged learners 
to strengthen the schools’ institutional and 
technical capacity and ensure that teachers 
use their increased autonomy effectively. 
They also need to sustain support for the 
process, recognizing that while legislation may 
instantly alter the distribution of responsibility, 
decentralization is a long, evolutionary process; 
in the years following, adjustments in design 
and participation are common and needed. 
Governments can learn by doing.

They also need to support effective supervision. 
School autonomy requires a shift in the 
role of school supervision from exercising 
administrative control to demanding 
accountability and offering support (De Grauwe, 
2007). Few developing countries have supervision 
services that are adequate for the task. In 
Benin, Guinea, Mali and Senegal, supervisors 
lack vehicles and funds for travel, while the 
number of teachers per officer has grown (De 
Grauwe and Lugaz, 2007). In South Asia, most 
supervisors are responsible for a high number 
of schools. Opportunities to give in-depth 
pedagogical support to teachers to improve 

At the school level, various conditions influence 
efficiency, though outcomes invariably 
depend on local factors. The effectiveness 
of decentralization reforms is closely linked 
to parental and community involvement. 
The community exercises influence through 
involvement in school committees. However, 
in Indonesia and Pakistan many participatory 
mechanisms remained inactive several years 
after implementation (Channa, 2014).

Schools must have sufficient financial and 
human resources to take on new responsibilities. 
Factors such as literacy levels in the community, 
the capability of local government officials and 
the level of human development in a region all 
influence whether communities can benefit from 
decentralization. The need for effective school 
leadership and managerial skills can increase 
when schools are given greater autonomy. 

But in many countries, the only requirements 
for becoming a head teacher are a teaching 
qualification and teaching experience. Individuals 
may have teaching experience but not the 
knowledge and skills to run schools. The OECD 
Teaching and Learning International Survey 
(TALIS) found, on average, that nearly two-thirds 
of principals’ time is spent on administration, 
leadership, curriculum and teaching (OECD, 
2014l). But in resource-limited education 
systems where professional development 
opportunities are lacking, it is difficult to 
build capacity for effective school leadership 
systematically and sustainably (Vaillant, 2014). 

There are exceptions. Chile adopted a 
new national leadership standard in 2005, 
and defined new leadership functions. 
South Africa’s Advanced Certificate in 
Education School Management and 
Leadership programme, launched in 2007, is 
an example of sound and systematic training. 
The United Republic of Tanzania has established 
the Agency for the Development of Educational 
Management (Vaillant, 2014).

countries, 
the only 
requirements 
for becoming

GOAL 6: QUALITY OF EDUCATIONThe decentralization of education governanceImplications of private 
provision for education quality

Private schooling has proliferated since Dakar. 
In both developed countries such as Sweden 
and middle income countries such as Chile, 
governments proactively opened up education 
provision and financing to for-profit and other 
private actors (Demsteader, 2013; Hsieh and 
Urquiola, 2006; McEwan and Carnoy, 2000; 
Orange, 2011). Government regulation of private 
school operations is often minimal. A wide range 
of private schools, catering for various income 
groups, has emerged. As Chapter 2 noted, there 
has been substantial expansion of low cost 
private schools, often hidden from government 
view, in developing countries including Ghana, 
India, Kenya, Nigeria and Pakistan. 

Evidence on the impact of private schools 
on education quality is mixed

Students in private schools often perform 
better than those in public schools on learning 
assessments. In developing country analysis 
that compares low cost private schools to 
government schools, students in private schools 
tend to outperform public school students in 
India (French and Kingdon, 2010; Tooley et al., 
2010) and Kenya (Dixon et al., 2013; Ngware 
et al., 2013). This private–public gap is likely 
attributable to the fact that students from 
wealthier and more advantaged backgrounds 
typically attend private schools. 

In Chile, where it was possible to compare 
public and private school children of similar 
backgrounds, the private school advantage 
was less pronounced (Chudgar and Quin, 2012; 
McEwan, 2001). Similarly, in the United States, 
recent evidence suggests a public school 
advantage once the demographic mix is 
disentangled from the dimension of school quality 
(Lubienski and Lubienski, 2013). By contrast, in the 
Republic of Korea, where students are randomly 
assigned to private and public high schools, 
private school students appear to outperform 
public school students, an outcome attributed to 
the greater autonomy and higher accountability of 
private schools (Hahn et al., 2014).

There is almost no evidence that private schools 
offer innovative ways to improve the quality 

of education. There was little difference in 
curricula in private schools in Ghana and Nigeria 
(Rolleston and Adefeso-Olateju, 2014) and there 
was a lack of innovative teaching methods in 
private schools in Kenya (Ngware et al., 2013). 
In fact, public schools may have more scope to 
be innovative with the curriculum while private 
schools are more wedded to parent demands for 
good examination results (Härmä, 2015).

By contrast, there is growing evidence of 
higher average efforts by teachers and 
responsiveness by parents in private schools 
in developing countries, even if they are more 
likely to hire teachers who lack teacher training 
and experience higher teacher turnover. 
Comparisons between public and private 
schools in some developing countries suggest 
private schools have less teacher absenteeism 
(Andrabi et al., 2008; Chaudhury et al., 2006), 
cater more to parent demands and have lower 
pupil/teacher ratios (Akaguri, 2014; Tooley et 
al., 2008). However, conditions in private schools 
vary substantially. Cheaper private schools often 
pay teachers a fraction of government teacher 
salaries (Andrabi et al., 2008; Fennell, 2013), 
and the schools that charge the lowest fees in 
many developing countries tend to have poor 
infrastructure (Härmä, 2015).

Parents’ decisions to select private schools 
are based not just on quality, but also on the 
goal of providing children with more beneficial 
peer networks (Elacqua et al., 2006; Nechyba, 
2009). In Chile, New Zealand, Sweden and the 
United States, substantial freedom to choose 
schools often leads to increased inequality. This 
sorting can have a direct impact on quality, as 
the wealthier and higher ability students and the 
better networked schools end up with the most 
benefits, and public schools increasingly serve 
disadvantaged populations (Fiske and Ladd, 
2000; Hsieh and Urquiola, 2006).

The longer-term effect of such choices is that 
decades of unregulated private sector growth 
can lead to situations where public schools 
are stigmatized. The implication, which has 
not been sufficiently recognized, is that public 
school reform efforts in curriculum, teaching 
or management may not be enough to attract 
a broader demographic of students without 
efforts to improve perceptions of public 
schooling as well.

In Chile,  
New Zealand, 
Sweden and the 
United States, 
substantial 
freedom to 
choose schools 
often leads 
to increased 
inequality

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 61025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportConclusion

The six goals adopted at the World Education 
Forum in Dakar in 2000 implicitly or explicitly 
integrate the dimension of quality. Goal 6 in 
particular commits countries to improve all 
aspects of education quality. Although much 
debate has surrounded attempts to define good 
quality education, the issue has become the 
focus of discussion worldwide by stakeholders: 
national governments, international partners, 
school authorities and parents.

Discussions, reports and cross-national 
assessments of education quality have 
proliferated, reflecting a relatively recent and 
marked emphasis on accountability and system 
monitoring. Moreover, a growing number of 
countries are conducting national assessments 
to measure learning achievement.

But good quality education is more than learning 
outcomes as measured by international, 
regional and national assessments. The 
evidence reviewed in this chapter highlights 
various dimensions of education quality: more 
and better trained teachers, improved learning 
materials available to all learners, school 
time in which teachers and pupils are actively 
engaged in learning activities, inclusive and 
relevant curricula, pedagogical renewal, more 
welcoming learning environments and better 
school governance.

While governments committed to improving 
education quality face difficult choices, policies 
to address this challenge are not beyond 
the reach of the most resource-constrained 
countries. Better education quality, responsive 
to the diverse needs and circumstances of all 
learners, has been achieved in very diverse 
political contexts and in societies with greatly 
varying degrees of wealth.

Examining trends over time provides 
a better assessment than measuring

chapter compares education progress 
between the periods before and after 
Dakar. It concludes that even if the 
EFA movement did not achieve the six 
Dakar goals, it helped bring the world 
closer to doing so. Additional research 
shows this is also true for countries 
with incomplete or missing data, which 
this GMR has made special efforts 
to include by examining alternative 
data sources.

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALL1025Education for All Global Monitoring Report  Chapter 7    Projections, EFA Development Index and  
countries with incomplete or missing data

What is the likelihood that 
countries will achieve 
EFA goals?

With the 2015 deadline reached, it is now 
possible to assess not only progress towards 
Education for All since the World Education 
Forum in Dakar in 2000, but also which countries 
have achieved EFA goals. Analyses have been 
conducted for three of the six goals.1 Goal 1 did 
not have a clear target; a proxy is used instead. 
Two goals had explicit quantitative targets: 
goal 2 (universal primary education) and goal 5 
(elimination of gender disparity in primary and 
secondary education).

Projections are extrapolated from observed 
trends of relevant indicators for each country 
between 1999 and 2012. Where data permitted, 
an additional set of projections was made, based 
on trends over the 1990s, to assess whether 
the implementation of the Dakar Framework 
for Action made any difference compared 
with observed progress during the Jomtien 
period, 1990–1999.

Goal 1: Early childhood education

The Dakar Framework called upon governments 
to expand and improve comprehensive early 
childhood care and education (ECCE), especially 
for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged 
children. As reported in Chapter 1, significant 
progress in participation in pre-primary 
education, measured by the gross enrolment 
ratio (GER), has occurred since 1999. But access 
to pre-primary education remains generally 
restricted for millions of children worldwide.

As Figure 7.1 shows, of the 148 countries 
with sufficient data to enable projections to be 
made for 2015:

 ■ 70, or 47%, would have high levels of 

participation in pre-school programmes, 

1. Analysis of achievement towards goal 4 on adult literacy, another 
quantitative EFA goal – to halve by 2015 the adult literacy levels observed in 
2000 – is carried out in Chapter 4. Goals 3 and 6 did not have sufficient explicit 
quantitative targets to be included in this analysis.

participation in pre-primary education remains very limited in 
about one-fifth of countries in 2015

regions are represented, with the 
majority of countries being in Central 
and Eastern Europe, Latin America and 
the Caribbean, and North America and 
Western Europe (Table 7.1).

 ■ 12, or 8%, would fall into the intermediate 

category, with a GER between 70% and 
79%, while 66 countries have GERs that 
are low (30–69%) or very low (below 30%), 
accounting for 25% and 20%, respectively, of 
the 148 countries included in the projections.

Arab States, East Asia and the Pacific, 
and Latin America and the Caribbean. But 
that list also includes countries in other 
regions, such as Armenia, Cameroon, 
Croatia and the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
Almost half the countries where levels 
of participation in pre-primary education 
are projected to remain very low are in 
sub-Saharan Africa, though that category 
also includes Cambodia, Tajikistan and the 
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. In

Tajikistan, not only is the pre-primary GER 
expected to remain extremely low in 2015, at 
less than 10%, but progress since 1999 has 
been very weak.

While early childhood programmes do not 
yet benefit all children, and are particularly 
restricted for those who need them most, there 
was substantial expansion of pre-primary 
education in the 15 years following the World 
Education Forum in Dakar. Figure 7.1 shows 
that the number of countries with high levels of 
pre-primary GER more than doubled between 
1999 and 2015, from 32 (19% of the countries 
with data) to 70 (47%). Consequently, the share 
of countries with very low participation levels 
was almost halved, from 38% to 20%, during the 
period. Two-thirds of the countries reporting a 
pre-primary GER above 80% in 2015 achieved 
this level after 1999.

Progress over the period is even more striking 
compared with what would have been the case if 
trends in participation in pre-primary education 
over the 1990s had continued. Comparison 

between projections based on 1990–1999 and 
those based on 1999–2012 shows that in 52 
countries progress accelerated over 1999–2012: 
their projected pre-primary GER is much higher 
than if 1990s trends had continued.

This is especially true for several countries with 
very low levels of pre-school participation in 1999 
that moved to the GER high levels category. In 
Algeria, the GER increased from 2% in 1999 to 
79% in 2011 and is projected to reach 101% in 
2015, rather than only 5% if the trends between 
1990 and 1999 had continued. Angola is another 
striking example: the GER increased significantly, 
from 27% to 86%, between 1999 and 2012, an 
increase of 59 percentage points, compared to 
only 10 percentage points between 1990 and 
1999. As a consequence, Angola moved from the 
very low level to the high category; projections 
based on 1990–1999 trends show that the GER 
would have been only 43% at best by 2015.

By contrast, progress in pre-primary 
enrolment after 1999 has slowed in 21 
countries compared with 1990–1999 trends,

in 2015. Among these countries are the 
Plurinational State of Bolivia, Palestine, 
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia 
and the United Kingdom, with the last example 
indicating that sustained attention to pre-
primary education is still required in high 
income countries.

Goal 2: Universal primary education

As discussed in Chapter 2, the goal of universal 
primary education was prominent, well funded, 
politically supported and extensively monitored. 
However, the target was missed by a wide margin 
by a large number of countries, where tens of 
millions of children remain out of school and do 
not enjoy their fundamental right to education. 
Figure 7.2 and Table 7.2 summarize the results 
of the projection analysis, which includes 140 
countries with sufficient data (out of 207 in 
all) and is based on the primary adjusted net 
enrolment ratio (ANER2). Of this number, 61 had 
already achieved the target by 2012; for the 79 
that had not yet done so, projections were made.

2. The ANER measures the proportion of children of primary school age who are enrolled either in primary or secondary school. It was projected only for countries 
with data for at least seven data points between 1999 and 2012 and where ANER was below 97% in 1999, 2012 or both. The 61 countries where ANER was 97% and 
above in 2012 were considered to have achieved the target. ANER projections were not done for them but they are included in the overall analysis.

PROJECTIONS, EFA DEVELOPMENT INDEX AND COUNTRIES WITH INCOMPLETE OR MISSING DATAWhat is the likelihood that countries will achieve EFA goals?Figure 7.2 shows that:

 ■ Only 73 countries, or 52% of the 140 in 

the sample, are likely to achieve universal 
primary enrolment by 2015, with an ANER 
of at least 97%.3 Most are in North America 
and Western Europe (18) and Latin America 
and the Caribbean (14), followed by East Asia 
and the Pacific (9), the Arab States (9) and 
Central and Eastern Europe (8). Central Asia, 
South and West Asia and sub-Saharan Africa 
are less represented in this group, with only 
5, 3 and 7 countries, respectively, achieving 
universal primary enrolment by 2015 (Table 
7.2). In many countries that have achieved 
the target, compulsory and free primary 
education has long been established and 
rigorously enforced.

 ■ 14, or 10%, are expected to be close to the 

target, with ANERs between 95% and 96% by 
2015. The vast majority, including Bulgaria, 
Indonesia, Luxembourg, Peru and Poland, 
have been moving either slowly towards 
or away from the target. Togo and the 
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela have moved 
close to the target from an intermediate 
position in 1999.

 ■ 40, or 29%, will likely be at mid-distance to 
universal primary enrolment, with ANERs 
ranging from 80% to 94%. About two-fifths 
have made strong or some progress since 
1999 while the vast majority are off track, 
with the ANER decreasing, sometimes 
substantially. Among the latter are several 
countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, 
including the British Virgin Islands and 
Saint Kitts and Nevis, that have moved away 
from the target they had achieved by 1999. 
The Plurinational State of Bolivia, Colombia 
and Saint Lucia have also lost significant 
ground since 1999, as have countries in other 
regions such as South Africa and Sri Lanka. 
Trends in all these countries stress the 
need for governments to implement strong, 
targeted and sustained policies to accelerate 
progress and to sustain the gains made from 
school expansion.

3.  The GMR defines universal primary enrolment as an ANER of at least 97%. 
The indicator only measures whether all children of official school age are 
enrolled; it does not indicate school completion. However, if it is 97% or above 
for many consecutive years, it is likely that all children enrolled complete at 
least primary school.

 ■ 13, or 9%, are projected to remain far from 
the target in 2015, with ANERs below 80%. 
Most are in sub-Saharan Africa, but the group 
also includes Djibouti and Mauritania in the 
Arab States, Pakistan in South and West Asia, 
and Guyana and Paraguay in Latin America 
and the Caribbean. In Paraguay, the 
proportion of primary school aged children 
enrolled declined significantly between 1999 
and 2011, from nearly 97% to 83%.

Access to school is an important step to 
universal primary education, but the Dakar 
Framework further called on governments to 
ensure that all children who enter school also 
complete it. Poor progress towards primary 
school completion makes universal primary 
education by 2015 even more elusive. Data 
show that progress towards universal primary 
education has been uneven, with enrolment 
growing but retention lagging. Low school 
retention means universal primary education will 
remain out of reach for millions for children.

Of the 139 countries with sufficient data for trend 
projections to be made for survival rates to last 
grade, Figure 7.3 shows that:

 ■ In 54, or 39%, almost all children enrolled 

in primary school are projected to reach 
the last grade by 2015, mostly in Central 
and Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and 
North America and Western Europe.

 ■ In 14, or 10%, 95% to 96% of children are 

projected to reach the last grade.

 ■ In 39, or 28%, 80% to 94% of children are 

projected to reach the last grade.

 ■ In 32, or 23%, three-quarters of which are in 
sub-Saharan Africa, at least 20% of children 
are likely to drop out early. In some countries, 
including Benin, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Madagascar 
and Uganda, school retention has worsened, 
with survival rates to last grade decreasing by 
at least 20% since 1999.

Combining intake and survival rates to assess 
whether a cohort of children with access to 
school would eventually complete it, Figure 7.3 
shows the extent to which the goal of universal 
primary education remains distant. Of the 
106 countries for which projections could be

survival to last grade:

 ■ Only 13, or 12%, are projected to achieve 
universal primary education by 2015, with 
at least 97% of a cohort of children likely to 
both enter school and reach the last grade. 
Seven are in Western Europe (Finland, France, 
Ireland, Italy, Norway, Switzerland and the 
United Kingdom), three are in Central Asia 
or Central and Eastern Europe (Croatia, 
Kazakhstan and Tajikistan), two are in 
East Asia (Japan and the Republic of Korea) 
and one, Tunisia, is in the Arab States.

 ■ In 46, or 43%, the projected cohort survival 

rate is lower than 80%. In 16 of these 
countries the rate is below 50%. It would be 
only 20% in Eritrea.

The failure by the vast majority of countries 
to achieve universal primary education 
should not overshadow the achievements of 
the Dakar Framework. For many countries, 
progress towards universal primary enrolment 
since 2000 has been greater than during the 
Jomtien decade.

Figure 7.2 shows clear movement towards 
universal primary enrolment since 1999, with 
the number of countries with primary ANER of 
at least 97% increasing from 52 to 73, or from 
36% to 52% of countries, by 2015. The majority 
of countries, 40, expected to reach the target 
by 2015 have done so since 1999 (Table 7.2). As 
many more countries were reaching the target, 
the percentage of those with low ANERs, far 
from the goal, was more than halved, dropping 
from 23% to 9% between 1999 and 2015.

Of the 27 countries where ANER was below 80% 
in 1999 and for which projections could be made, 
20 increased the ratio by more than 27% by 2012. 
In Burundi, Djibouti and Niger, the proportion 
of primary school aged children enrolled either 
in primary or secondary education more than 
doubled. In Burundi, it rose from 41% in 1999 
to 94% in 2010 due to a policy abolishing school 
fees since 2005; this strong progress points to 
Burundi reaching universal enrolment by 2015. 
Morocco, Nepal and Zambia were also far from 
the target in 1999 but had reached it by 2012.

Country progress is even more pronounced 
when compared with progress before 1999.

Data limitations mean that comparison between 
trends before and after 1999 could only be done 
for 63 countries; of these, 19 were either far 
from or at mid-distance to the universal primary 
enrolment target. In 16, progress over 1999–2012 
was greater than that recorded before 1999, with 
projections of ANER for 2015 based on 1999–
2012 being much higher than if 1990s trends 
had continued.

In Morocco, whose ANER was 71% in 1999, if 
the previous trends had continued the projected 
ratio would have stood at 89% in 2015. Instead, 
universal primary enrolment was reached by 
2013 due to significant progress since 1999. 
Burkina Faso, Djibouti and Niger had ANERs 
below 40% in 1999 and are still far from the 
target, but thanks to substantial progress after 
1999, their ANERs in 2012 were greater than 
projected based on 1990s trends.

The EFA process made a clear and obvious 
difference, helping accelerate progress 
towards primary school enrolment in many 
countries. However, in others there was no 
impact and progress even reversed after 1999, 
as in Azerbaijan, Colombia, Paraguay and 
South Africa.

PROJECTIONS, EFA DEVELOPMENT INDEX AND COUNTRIES WITH INCOMPLETE OR MISSING DATAWhat is the likelihood that countries will achieve EFA goals?Goal 5: Gender parity and equality 
in education

Progress towards the gender parity goal has 
been one of the greatest EFA successes since 
1999, especially in a number of countries 
with marked gender disparity at the time, as 
Chapter 5 shows. This has been particularly 
true for primary education, where the significant 
increase in enrolment has benefited girls to a 
great extent in many countries, especially in 
South and West Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

The assessment of the extent to which the 
gender parity goal has been achieved in 2015 is 
based on trend projections made on the gender 
parity index (GPI) derived from the projected 
gross enrolment ratio (GER) of both primary 
and secondary education. Since the EFA Global 
Monitoring Report 2003/4, gender parity has been 
defined as a GPI between 0.97 and 1.03. Out of 
the total of 207 countries, 170 had sufficient 
data for projections to 2015 for primary and 
157 for secondary education, including 107 
countries that had already achieved gender 
parity by 2012 in primary education and 58 in 
secondary education.

Figure 7.4a shows the distribution of countries 
by level of GPI reached in primary education. Of 
the 170 countries with data at primary level:

 ■ 117, or 69%, have achieved gender parity 
between 0.97 and 1.03, or are likely to do 
so. Most countries in this group are in 
North America and Western Europe (24), 
Latin America and the Caribbean (20), 
Central and Eastern Europe (19) and East Asia 
and the Pacific (19); 17 countries in  
sub-Saharan Africa are also likely to having 
achieved gender parity in primary education, 
as are 7 in the Arab States and Central Asia, 
respectively, and 4 in South and West Asia.

 ■ 17, or 10%, are likely to be close to the target 

by 2015, with GPIs between 0.95 and 0.96 
or between 1.04 and 1.05. Most have been 
making slow progress; some had reached the 
target in 1999 but have since moved slightly 
away. Among the latter group are several 
countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, 
including Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, 
Paraguay and Uruguay. Meanwhile, 
Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Morocco, Pakistan 

and Togo have made strong progress towards 
eliminating gender disparity in primary 
education since 1999.

 ■ 35, or 21% of the sample, are projected by 
2015 to be at mid-distance to the gender 
parity target, with GPIs between 0.80 and 
0.94 or between 1.06 and 1.25. Most of these 
countries have recorded slow progress 
towards gender parity or decreases in the 
GPI. In the British Virgin Islands, Cabo Verde, 
the Dominican Republic, Grenada, Lebanon, 
South Africa and Suriname, the situation 
of girls has been deteriorating. The 
reverse has happened in other countries, 
including the Gambia, Guyana, Malawi, 
Mauritania, Nepal and Senegal, where 
boys are now underrepresented in primary 
school enrolment.

 ■ The Central African Republic is likely to be the 
sole country far from gender parity in primary 
education, with a GPI below 0.80. It has made 
some progress, as its GPI increased from 
0.68 to 0.74 between 2001 and 2012, but the 
conflict situation since 2012 is likely to have 
ruined the fragile gains made.

Progress towards eliminating gender disparity 
since 1999 was much less marked in secondary 
education. While more than two-thirds of the 
countries with data are projected to reach 
gender parity in primary education by 2015, less 
than half are likely to do so at the secondary 
level. Figure 7.4b illustrates the extent of 
the problem. Of the 157 countries included 
in projections:

 ■ 76, or 48%, are projected to have reached 

gender parity in secondary education by 
2015. Hence, in more than half the countries 
with data, gender disparities still prevail. 
Most of the countries projected to achieve 
gender parity in secondary education are 
in North America and Western Europe (22), 
Central and Eastern Europe (15), East Asia 
and the Pacific (13) and Latin America and 
the Caribbean (11). Six countries in the 
Arab States are likely to have reached the 
target, four in sub-Saharan Africa (Comoros, 
Malawi, South Africa and Swaziland), Central 
Asia, respectively, and one in South and West 
Asia (India).

greatest EFA 
successes

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 71025Education for All Global Monitoring Report ■ 11, or 7%, are projected to be near the target. 

Most have GPIs exceeding 1.03, indicating 
gender disparity at boys’ expense. Among 
the 11 are Algeria, Aruba, the Bahamas, 
Costa Rica, Latvia and Tonga. Algeria, the 
Bahamas, Kazakhstan and Rwanda had 
gender parity in secondary education in 
1999 but no longer do. In the latter two, the 
disparity is at the expense of girls.

 ■ 55, or 35%, are projected to be at mid-

distance to the gender parity target by 2015, 
and 32 of them have moved away from 
the target since 1999. In many countries, 
mainly in Latin America and the Caribbean, 
boys’ enrolment in secondary education 
decreased between 1999 and 2012. This also 
happened in Palestine, Qatar and Tunisia 
in the Arab States; Bangladesh, Bhutan 
and Nepal in South and West Asia; and 
Cabo Verde, Mauritius and Seychelles in 
sub-Saharan Africa. Seventeen countries 
have made either some progress (the 
Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Mauritania 
and Mozambique) or strong progress 
(Senegal) in reducing gender disparity. In the 
Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Uruguay 

and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, 
where fewer boys than girls are enrolled in 
secondary education, the situation for boys 
has been improving.

 ■ 15, or 10%, are projected to be far from 
the target, with GPIs below 80%. Benin, 
Burkina Faso, Chad, Guinea, Mali and Yemen 
still have low GPIs but have made strong 
progress towards reducing gender disparity 
to improve the situation of girls. In Angola, 
disparity at girls’ expense has deepened, 
while in Lesotho 100 boys to 140 girls were 
enrolled in secondary schools in 2012, almost 
the same as in 1999.

While progress in primary and secondary 
education can be assessed separately, it is more 
effective to consider both levels together to 
effectively measure the extent of achievement of 
goal 5’s aim to eliminate gender disparity. Data 
permitting projections for achieving the gender 
parity target at both education levels were 
available for 145 countries. Assessing gender 
parity in primary and secondary education 
together shows it continuous prevalence in many

The gender parity goal has been missed in more 
than half the countries with data, but this should 
not overshadow the progress, sometimes strong, 
made by many countries worldwide to reduce 
gender disparity, an important step towards 
gender equality in education. The number of 
countries that have achieved gender parity in 
both primary and secondary education increased 
from 36 to 46 between 1999 and 2012 and will 
be 62 by 2015 if trends over the period continue. 
The impact on the situation in 2015 of trends 
since 1999 is even greater compared with the 
projected pace of progress if trends before 1999 
had continued. Projections based on 1990–1999 
trends would show only 25 countries at gender 
parity at both the primary and secondary 
levels by 2015.

Gender disparity remains greater in secondary 
education than in primary, but the impact of 
trends since 1999 on projections is strong. 
The number of countries at gender parity in 
secondary education is projected in 2015 to be 
76, more than double the 34 expected if 1990s 
trends had continued. In primary education, 117 
countries would achieve parity by 2015 based 
on progress made since 1999, half again as 
many as the projected 78 if trends before 1999 
had continued.

In one-third of the 21 countries that were far 
from gender parity in primary education in 1999, 
progress in reducing disparities has accelerated. 
They are now expected either to be close to the 
target by 2015 (Burkina Faso and Togo) or at 
mid-distance to it (Djibouti, Guinea, Mozambique 
and Niger), a much better performance than 
if trends before 1999 had continued. Benin, 
with a primary education GPI of 0.64 in 1999, is 
likely to reach gender parity by 2015; it would 
have been at mid-distance if trends before 1999 
had continued.

At secondary level, the performance of India, the 
Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Malawi, Mali, 
Mozambique, Senegal and Solomon Islands is 
worth highlighting. All were far from the target 
in 1999, with GPIs below 0.80, but have made 
strong progress in reducing gender disparity at 
this level. Projections for 2015 outpace what they 
would have been if trends over 1990–1999 had 
continued. India and Malawi, where GPI stood at 
0.70 in 1999, are likely to achieve parity by 2015. 
Malawi would have still been far from the target 
if 1990s trends had continued.

The EFA Development Index (EDI) is a composite

progress towards Education for All.4 Due to 
data constraints, the standard index captures 
only four of the six goals, with goals 1 and 3 
being excluded. The value of the standard EDI 
for a given country is the arithmetic mean of 
four components:

 ■ Universal primary education (goal 2), 

measured by the primary ANER.

 ■ Adult literacy (goal 4), measured by the 

literacy rate for those aged 15 and above.

 ■ Gender parity and equality (goal 5), measured 

by the gender-specific EFA index (GEI), 
an average of the GPIs of the primary and 
secondary gross enrolment ratios and of the 
adult literacy rate.5 

 ■ Quality of education (goal 6), measured by the 

survival rate to grade 5.6

The EDI value falls between 0 and 1, with 1 
representing full achievement of EFA across 
the four goals.

The EDI in 2012

Out of 207 countries, 113 (55%) have data on all 
four of the indicators required to calculate the 
EDI for the school year ending in 2012. By region, 
country coverage ranges from 30% in East Asia 
and the Pacific to more than 75% in Central 
and Eastern Europe and North America and 
Western Europe (Table EDI.1, GMR website). This 
relatively low coverage means the index provides 
only a partial overview of global progress 

4. Additional information on the EDI and its rational and methodology is 
available on the GMR website at www.efareport.unesco.org.
5. When expressed as the ratio of female to male enrolment or literacy rate, 
the GPI can exceed unity when more females are enrolled or literate than 
males. In those cases, for the purpose of the EDI, where all values should 
range from 0 to 1, the GEI is calculated by inverting the standard formula of 
GPI (F/M) to male over female (M/F). This ensures that the GEI remains below 
1 while maintaining its ability to show gender disparity. After all necessary 
adjustments are made, the GEI is obtained by calculating a simple average of 
the three GPIs.
6. As comparable indicators on quality, notably on learning outcomes, are 
not available for many countries, the survival rate to grade 5 is used as a 
proxy because of its positive correlation with average international learning 
assessment scores.

towards Education for All. It should also be 
noted that the current definition of EDI excludes 
goals 1 and 3.

In 2012, the United Kingdom and Japan had 
the highest EDI scores, at 0.996 and 0.994, 
respectively, and Central African Republic, 
Niger and Chad had the lowest at 0.559, 
0.534 and 0.520.

Countries are grouped in three categories 
according to EDI score (Table 7.3): high for those 
with scores above 0.95; medium for scores 
ranging from 0.80 to 0.94; and low for those 
with scores less than 0.80. The index shows 
that by 2012:

 ■ 57 mostly high income countries in 
Central and Eastern Europe and in 
North America and Western Europe were 
in the high EFA achievement category. 
No country in South and West Asia or 
sub-Saharan Africa was part of this group.

 ■ 38 mostly lower and upper middle income 
countries in the Arab States, Latin America 
and the Caribbean and sub-Saharan Africa 
were in the medium EFA achievement 
category, with an average EDI score of 
0.899. In many of these countries, progress 
across the EDI components was unbalanced; 
countries prioritized some goals at the 
expense of others. Most countries in the 
Arab States with medium EDI scores achieved 
universal primary enrolment but had relatively 
low adult literacy rates: below 80% in Algeria, 
Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia. In Latin America 
and the Caribbean, millions of children who 
have access to primary school do not reach 
grade 5. In Guatemala, for example, the 
primary ANER was more than 95% in 2012, 
but the survival rate to grade 5 was 75% 
and the adult literacy rate of 78% remained 
relatively low, pulling down its overall 
achievement to an EDI of 0.850.

 ■ 18 mostly low income countries were far 
from achieving EFA as a whole, with EDI 
scores below 0.80. Chad and Niger were at 
the bottom of the EDI ranking, with scores 
of 0.520 and 0.534, respectively. Countries 
in the low category are mostly from 
sub-Saharan Africa but also include Sudan in 
the Arab States, as well as Bangladesh, Nepal 

Most countries

States with

scores achieved

enrolment but

PROJECTIONS, EFA DEVELOPMENT INDEX AND COUNTRIES WITH INCOMPLETE OR MISSING DATAThe Education for All Development Indexand Pakistan in South and West Asia. Most of 
these countries had a poor record across all 
four EFA goals included in the EDI. The few 
exceptions had education policies that were 
extremely imbalanced. Bangladesh was close 
to universal primary enrolment with a primary 
ANER of 96% in 2012. However, its adult 
literacy rate is still quite low at 59%, and one-
third of primary school pupils leave school too 
early to acquire solid basic skills. The case of 
Rwanda is also striking: the primary ANER 
was as high as 99% in 2012, but schools fail to 
retain children in school until the last grade. 
Only 52% pupils reached the last grade in 
2011. Such a low level of school completion, 
together with the still low adult literacy rate 
of 66% in 2011, translated to low overall EFA 
achievement, represented by an EDI of 0.777.

EFA remains an unfinished policy agenda in 
many respects and for many countries. Not only 
have adult literacy and quality of education been 
neglected, as regular monitoring of progress 
since 2000 has shown, but gender remains 
an important issue in many countries despite 
substantial progress. In most low income 
countries in the low EDI category, the GEI is 
below 0.80, indicating significant gender disparity 
in primary or secondary education and adult 
literacy, or all three, mainly at the expense of girls 
and women. Some medium EDI countries also 
suffer from gender disparity, particularly many 
upper middle income countries in Latin America 
and the Caribbean. There, gender is mainly a 
boys’ issue, notably in upper secondary education, 
often due to their higher dropout rates.

Expanding lifelong learning, including adult 
literacy, assuring good quality education and 
reducing inequality need to be at the centre 
of the post-2015 global education agenda. 
Completing the unfinished EFA agenda will 
remain a distant goal in coming years without 
more inclusive, equitable and holistic education 
policies that pay equal attention to all EFA 
priorities. This implies a comprehensive lifelong 
learning approach that includes formal, non-
formal and informal education at all ages. It 
should also pay attention to toddlers and young 
children through implementation of quality early 
childhood care and education programmes, 
which have not received sustained policy 
attention since 2000, including in some countries 
that top the EDI rankings. 

Indeed, the inclusion of the ECCE index7 in 
an extended EDI clearly pulls down scores 
compared with standard EDI scores (Table 7.3). 
In Central Asia, for example, Tajikistan is a high 
achiever in the standard EDI ranking at 0.981, 
but it falls from 3rd to 21st in the extended EDI 
with 0.912 due to a very low ECCE index score of 
0.638. Tajikistan is far from achieving EFA goal 1 
due to a still high stunting rate (26%) and a very 
low proportion of children aged 3 to 7 enrolled in 
either pre-primary or primary education (27%). 
The low attention paid to goal 1 is a concern; 
ECCE, along with adult literacy and gender, is 
one of the best predictors of EFA.

Changes between 1999 and 2012

Changes in the EDI between 1999 and 2012 
could be analysed for 51 countries (Figure 
7.6): 45, or 88%, improved their EDI scores, by 
an average of 8%. In Ghana, Guatemala, the 
Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Mauritania, 
Nepal and Senegal, the EDI rose by more 
than 20%, and it jumped by more than 30% in 
Burkina Faso and Niger. Burkina Faso’s EDI 
rose from 0.467 to 0.635 through substantial 
improvement in school participation of children 
of primary school age and a reduced gender 
disparity in schooling and adult literacy. In 
Burkina Faso, Ghana and Niger, school retention 
also improved significantly, contributing to their 
increased EDI scores. Not only were children 
participating in greater numbers, but they were 
also more likely to reach grade 5, an important 
indicator of basic knowledge and literacy skill 
acquisition. Ghana and Morocco made rapid 
progress, moving from the low to the medium 
category: the EDI increased from 0.672 to 0.847 
in Ghana and from 0.697 to 0.864 in Morocco.

Overall, the substantial progress towards 
primary school participation in many parts of the 
world has had a positive impact on overall EFA 
achievement. Improvement in primary ANER 
seems to be mainly responsible for this progress 
as measured by the EDI, with an average 
increase of nearly 15% across the 51 countries. 

7. The ECCE index summarizes the results of early childhood development 
policies on (i) health, measured by the percentage of children who will 
survive beyond their fifth birthday; (ii) nutrition, measured by the percentage 
of children under 5 who do not suffer moderate or severe stunting; and 
(iii) education, measured by the percentage of children aged 3 to 7 who are 
enrolled in either pre-primary or primary school. The value of the ECCE index 
is the mean of these three indicators.

EFA remains 
an unfinished 
policy agenda 
in many 
respects and 
for many 
countries

Notes: Data in blue indicate gender disparity at the expense of boys or men, particularly at the secondary level. 
1. The primary ANER measures the proportion of children of primary school age who are enrolled in either primary or secondary school. 
2. The adult literacy rate is a proxy measure based on the proportion of those aged 25 and older who have at least completed primary education. 
3. In the absence of data on the survival rate to grade 5, 99% is used because of the country’s long-standing tradition and enforcement of compulsory education. 
4. The survival rate to the last grade is used because the primary education cycle is less than five years. 
5. Adult literacy rates are unofficial UIS estimates.
Sources: Annex, Statistical Tables 2, 3A, 3B, 5, 6 and 7 (print); UIS database; EFA Global Monitoring Report team calculations.

In Mozambique, the proportion of primary 
school age children enrolled in school increased 
by 67% between 1999 and 2012, while it more 
than doubled in Niger, from 27% to nearly 64%. 
The adult literacy rate increased by nearly 
8%, on average, and was the second biggest 
contributor to the increase in the EDI across the 
51 countries, followed by increases in the gender 
component as measured by the GEI (5.5%) 
and improvement in the quality component as 
measured by the survival rate to grade 5 (5.0%).

How many countries are likely to achieve 
EFA as a whole by 2015?

Building on the previous analysis of the 
prospects of achieving EFA goals 1, 2 and 5 by 
2015, it is possible to assess the extent to which 
countries can be expected to achieve EFA as a 
whole in 2015 in terms of EDI values. For this 
GMR, projected EDI scores could be calculated 
for 94 countries, 52 of which also have EDI 
scores for 1999 (Table EDI.8, GMR website).

Note: Only countries with EDI values in both 1999 and 2012 are included.
Source: Table EDI.3 (GMR website).

Of the 94 countries, 47 are projected to be in the 
high EDI category, likely to having achieved EFA 
as a whole or to be close to do so. Projections 
indicate that 33 countries will be in the medium 
EDI category and 14 in the low category, mostly 
unchanged from 2012.

While these patterns indicate limited change, 
with most countries remaining in the same EDI 
category in 2015 as in 2012, some examples 
of improvement can be highlighted. Bhutan, 
Burkina Faso, Mali and Mozambique are likely 
to increase their EDI scores by 6% or more 
between 2012 and 2015, though most are 
projected to still be very far from achieving EFA 
as a whole. Looking back to 1999, the progress 

by some of these countries is significant. The EDI 
value of Burkina Faso is projected to increase 
by 49% between 1999 and 2015, to 0.694, that of 
Mozambique by 40% to 0.721 and that of Niger 
by 38% to 0.556.

Countries with incomplete  
or missing data

The GMR makes extensive use of comparable 
country-level data, collected and quality-assured 
by the UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS), 
to show countries’ progress on goals with 
specific targets. However, some countries have 

234

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 71025Education for All Global Monitoring Reportinsufficient or unreliable data for international 
comparisons. This lack prevents a full 
assessment of EFA progress in all countries.

Cases of missing information may be related 
to either population or enrolment data. Age-
specific population data provided by the UN 
Population Division (UNPD) are occasionally 
inconsistent with enrolment data provided by 
the UIS, leading, for example, to net enrolment 
ratios exceeding 100% or to very low or high 
enrolment ratios in countries where other 
evidence suggests otherwise. Note also that the 
UNPD does not produce population estimates 
for countries with fewer than 50,000 inhabitants 
(UNESCO, 2014c).8 Complete enrolment 
information has not been collected in some 
countries, often as a result of poor statistical 
information systems, or emergencies such as 
armed conflict or natural disasters. And some 
countries may have national statistics but not 
always report them at the international level.

For this final report in the EFA series, the GMR 
team has identified 35 countries or territories9 
with insufficient or no data for four core EFA 
indicators over 1999–2012 and made a concerted 
effort to find other sources of information, 
including national sources, on selected EFA 
goals. The overall aim was to provide an 
indication of the extent of education progress 
in each country since 1999, in the absence of 
cross-country comparable data that remain the 
main basis of global monitoring.

The following four indicators of progress at 
the pre-primary and primary education levels 
were examined:

1.  Pre-primary education gross enrolment 

ratio (GER.0)

2.  Primary education gross enrolment ratio 
(GER.1) and net enrolment ratio (NER.1)

8. For countries in this case, the UIS uses national population data when 
available or makes its own population estimates for use in indicator 
calculations.
9. Andorra, Anguilla, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, Cayman 
Islands, Curaçao, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Ethiopia, Haiti, 
Iraq, Kenya, Kiribati, Libya, Macao (China), Maldives, the Federated States of 
Micronesia, Monaco, Montserrat, Niue, Palau, the Philippines, Saint Martin, 
San Marino, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sint Maarten, Somalia, South Sudan, 
Timor-Leste, Tokelau, Turkmenistan, Turks and Caicos Islands, Tuvalu and 
Zimbabwe.

3.  Survival rate to the last grade of primary 

education (SR.1)

4.  Gender parity index for GER.1 and SR.1.

For each indicator, countries with missing or 
insufficient data between 1999 and 2012 were 
identified, then classified according to the main 
cause of the absence of data.10

Five data sources were used for these ‘missing 
cases’: national administrative data, national 
EFA 2015 reports, other international databases, 
academic articles and direct contact with 
national-level officials or stakeholders. These 
sources allowed for a brief summary of education 
progress for 23 of the 35 countries, of which 
some are referred to below. A special profile for 
each country is found on the GMR website. 

Countries with missing population data

For countries with missing information on 
population, the GMR team searched for data in 
publications provided by each country’s national 
statistics office. For most such countries, it was 
challenging to find information corresponding 
to the school age groups recommended by the 
Institutional standard classification of education 
system (ISCED). In the end, national census 
data could be used only for Andorra, Ethiopia 
and Tuvalu. After locating relevant age-specific 
population information, it was possible to 
calculate the four indicators of progress. The 
Department of Statistics of Macao (China) 
and the Ministry of Education of Singapore 
directly sent requested information on the four 
indicators, when available.

In 2012, for early childhood care and education, 
Andorra, Macao (China) and Tuvalu had high 
levels of participation in pre-primary education, 
with a GER of nearly 100%, 92% and 91%, 
respectively. Andorra and Macao (China) have 
maintained high levels of pre-primary enrolment 
since 1999/2000, when their respective ratios 
were 108% and 90%. Although Tuvalu still has a 
high level of pre-primary enrolment, it decreased 
its GER from 96% in 2001 to 91% in 2012. 
Ethiopia significantly increased its GER (Box 7.1).

less than 37%. Tuvalu’s SR is available only for 
2002 and 2004.

Ethiopia 
achieved large 
increases 
in both  
pre-primary 
and primary 
enrolment

In primary education, Macao (China) and 
Singapore have maintained a high GER and 
NER since 2000. Andorra reached the target 
of universal primary enrolment in 2002 and 
has maintained it, with an NER of 99% in 2002 
and 2012. Singapore reached the target, going 
from an NER of almost 96% in 2000 to an NER 
of 100% in 2012. Macao (China) increased its 
NER from 85% in 2000 to 90% in 2012. Tuvalu’s 
NER fell from 97% in 2002 to 95% in 2012, so 
the country has regressed to the close to the 
target category. Ethiopia, as Box 7.1 shows, is 
also in an intermediary position, with significant 
increases of its GER and NER. 

Regarding gender parity in primary education, 
Andorra and Macao (China) were both 
successful, with GPIs of 0.99. Ethiopia has 
made great progress in achieving gender parity 
since 2000/01: its GPI went from 0.65 to 0.93. 
However, gender disparity still persists at the 
expense of girls.

For survival rates to the last grade of primary, 
the only country with available information for 
the whole period between 2000 and 2011 was 
Ethiopia, where the rate dropped from 61% to 

Box 7.1: Ethiopia has made significant progress

Ethiopia increased its pre-primary GER considerably, from 2% in 2000 to 
almost 22% in 2011. The 2013/4 EFA Global Monitoring Report showed that 
the country also achieved large increases in its primary enrolment rates 
between 1999 and 2011, with its GER increasing from 50% to 106% and its 
NER from 37% to 87%. For the 2012 data, the use of different sources meant 
using a different age group, 7–10 instead of 7–12. While this inflates a bit the 
increases in the primary GER, to nearly 123%, and NER, to 92%, the country 
is definitively well on its way to the target of universal primary education.

Gender parity in primary education also improved, with the GPI of the GER 
going from 0.65 in 2000 to 0.93 in 2012. However, girls are still under-
represented in primary school. Gender disparity appears in a different light 
if one considers survival rates to the last grade of primary. In 2000, the SR 
for girls was 63%, compared to 60% for boys. By 2011, rates for both had 
declined substantially, to less than 40% and 34%, respectively, indicating 
that in Ethiopia more girls than boys still reach the last grade of primary 
school (UNESCO, 2010a). In Ethiopia, as in other countries (see Chapter 
5), the predominant barriers for girls are starting school at all, rather than 
completing school once they have begun.

Countries with missing enrolment data

For many countries that had population data 
but lacked complete or had partial enrolment 
data available over the period, information was 
compiled from many sources. For the Democratic 
People’s Republic of Korea, Iraq, the Philippines, 
Saudi Arabia, Timor-Leste and Zimbabwe, 
enrolment data was found in national EFA 2015 
review reports. For Botswana, Haiti, Kenya, 
Kiribati, Libya, the Federated States of Micronesia 
and South Sudan, enrolment data were found 
in documents provided by statistics offices and 
education ministries. In the case of Somalia, 
enrolment data were calculated from UNESCO 
and World Bank reports.

Analysis of the selected countries that initially 
lacked enrolment data makes clear that, 
though eight increased their pre-primary gross 
enrolment ratio, in some cases significantly, 
much work is still needed to make early 
childhood education available for all children. In 
2011/2012, in countries including Iraq, Kiribati, 
Saudi Arabia, South Sudan and Timor-Leste, 
the pre-primary GER was 18% or less. Kenya’s 
GER was 66%, that of the Federated States of 
Micronesia 48% and that of Zimbabwe nearly 
31%. Haiti and the Philippines were the only 
countries with a pre-primary GER of over 70%.

In terms of progress toward goal 2, Botswana, 
the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, 
Haiti, Iraq, Kenya, Kiribati, Libya, the Philippines 
and Timor-Leste have maintained a GER of 96% 
or above since 2000. The Federated States of 
Micronesia, with a 99% GER in 2012, and Saudi 
Arabia, with a 106% GER in 2013, have increased 
their participation in primary education since 
Dakar. Somalia and South Sudan have also made 
significant progress.

The NER gives a more accurate indication about 
progress to universal primary enrolment. For 
NER, Botswana, Kenya, Kiribati and Timor-Leste 
have reached an intermediate position regarding 
the universal primary enrolment target, with 
Timor-Leste having significantly increased its NER 
from 67% in 2000 to 94% in 2012. Haiti, Iraq, the 
Philippines and Zimbabwe are close to reaching 
targets, with Haiti making strong progress 

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 71025Education for All Global Monitoring Reporttowards universal primary enrolment (Box 7.2). 
Saudi Arabia moved from the intermediate 
category to close to the target, increasing its NER 
from 89% in 2001 to nearly 97% in 2013. But South 
Sudan, despite a significant increase from 20% in 
2000 to 41% in 2013, is still far from the target. For 
the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, NER 
is available only for 2008 and 2012, at nearly 99%. 
No NER data are available for the whole period for 
Libya or Somalia.

Alternative data sources were also used to 
assess progress towards gender parity. Most 
countries analysed had achieved gender parity, 
with GPIs ranging from 0.98 in Zimbabwe to 1.02 
in Libya. Somalia had substantial disparity at 
girls’ expense in 2012 with a GPI of 0.74, though 
this was a significant improvement from 0.54 in 
1999. Saudi Arabia made great strides to reach 
gender parity, increasing its primary education 
GPI from 0.92 to 1.03 between 2000 and 2013. 
No data were available to assess progress 
in gender parity for the whole period for Iraq 
or South Sudan.

The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, 
Haiti, Kenya, Libya, and South Sudan had no 
data concerning survival rates to the last grade 
of primary. Botswana and Somalia did not have 
survival rate data for the latest period, while 
Timor-Leste had information from 2005 to 2010 
only. In the Philippines, survival rates fluctuated, 
decreasing from 75% in 2001 to 70% in 2005 and 
increasing to 75% in 2012. Saudi Arabia went 
from being close to the target in 2001, with a 
survival rate of 95%, to reaching it in 2012 at 99%. 
The survival rates for Iraq, Kiribati and Zimbabwe 
also increased.

Conclusions

While this chapter has showed a clear 
improvement towards EFA in many countries, the 
lack of sufficient and reliable data continues to 
impede comprehensive assessment of countries’ 
progress towards the goals. The reasons for 
lack of data vary, but all need to be tackled and 
addressed. The GMR team has made an attempt 
to bridge the data gaps and to increase the 
country coverage. 

GMR team analysis showed that a majority 
of the countries with missing cross-country 
comparable data produced by UIS for 

Box 7.2: Haiti has made considerable progress

Haiti lacks enrolment data because instability of its political and 
educational system, aggravated by the earthquake of 2010, has 
made the reporting of education data irregular and inconsistent. 
While some caution is needed regarding the data included in this 
analysis, they show that the proportion of children enrolled in pre-
primary and primary school had risen since 2001.

Haiti’s pre-primary GER increased from 44% in 2001 to 75% in 
2010, taking it much closer to the high category. The primary GER 
increased from 120% in 2001 to nearly 157% in 2010 (reflecting a 
large number of over-age students), while the NER increased from 
60% to 95%.

The GPI of the primary GER reached the target in 2001 at 0.99, 
and Haiti maintained its position in 2010 at 1.01. There are no data 
to assess survival rates to the last grade of primary, however.

which alternative sources were found made 
considerable progress on the EFA agenda, as 
measured by the four indicators examined. This 
exercise was useful not only to shed light on 
countries that are otherwise ‘invisible’, but also 
because the search for data sources could be 
even more essential when monitoring progress 
towards eventual post-2015 Sustainable 
Development Goal targets. Ultimately, it 
stresses the need of improved data collection, 
reporting and sharing by countries and at the 
international level.

Some problems concerning the lack of data 
found during this research were similar to those 
pointed out by the Independent Expert Advisory 
Group on a Data Revolution for Sustainable 
Development. In particular, the Group recognized 
that existing data was not used because it was 
shared too late or not at all. The experts also 
commented on the lack of data needed for 
decision-making (IEAG, 2014).

As the international community progresses 
towards the Sustainable Development Goals, 
it is important to focus on more efficient 
and transparent ways to improve not only 
data collection, reporting and availability, but 
also the timeliness of data in the context of 
data harmonization for better comparison 
across countries.

Highlights ■Many countries have increased spending on education. Between 1999 and 2012, 38 countries increased their spending by 1 percentage point  or more of national income. ■Education is not a priority in many national budgets. As a share of government spending, expenditure on education has changed little since 1999, and at 13.7% in 2012, falls short of the recommended 15% to 20% target. ■Despite the Dakar pledge to provide free education, in many lower income countries, poor government investment means that households continue to incur education-related costs. ■Over the past 10 years, civil society organizations have become an important voice in national debates around participation, transparency and accountability in education spending. ■Governments and donors have neglected to fund EFA goals outside of primary education. As a result, pre-primary education and adult literacy, in particular, remain underfunded. Donors continue to disburse large amounts of aid to non-EFA related areas at the expense of basic education.  ■Donors have largely failed on their commitment to deliver aid more effectively, achieving just 1 of 13 aid effectiveness targets. Effective international coordination and distribution of aid to education have been almost entirely absent.1025Finance .........................................241

This chapter reviews progress in 
education financing since Dakar. It 
reviews trends in domestic funding 
for education in terms of the 
amounts and efficiency of spending, 
and the prioritization of education 
in national budgets. The chapter 
assesses whether donors have met 
their commitments and whether 
this aid was effectively governed. 
It proposes that more funds be 
directed to pre-primary education,  
as well as to neglected areas such as 
quality education and adult literacy. 
It explores ways that both domestic 
funding and international aid could 
be more focused, effectively used 
and transparent.

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALL1025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportChanging national financial commitments to EFA since Dakar

  Chapter 8    Finance

Mobilize strong national and international political commitment for education 
for all, develop national action plans and enhance significantly investment 
in education.

The 2000 Dakar Framework for Action called for 
significant increases in financial commitment 
by national governments and donors to the 
education sector to accelerate progress towards 
the Education For All (EFA) goals. It encouraged 
donors to support government efforts to 
increase aid for basic education and deliver it as 
effectively as possible.

This marked a strategic shift from the view 
of finance at the time of the 1990 Jomtien 
conference, when the structural adjustment 
programmes of the 1980s had led to deep cuts 
in government spending on education and the 
role of non-state finance grew. By contrast, 
the Dakar Framework implicitly recommended 
governments to take the lead in increasing 
financial commitments to EFA, with the EFA 
High Level Steering Committee proposing that 
15% to 20% of annual budgets be earmarked for 
education. The Millennium Development Goals 
(MDGs) set similar goals for other basic service 
sectors, such as health and water and sanitation, 
with governments committing a minimum share 
of their annual budgets to help achieve poverty 
reduction goals (African Union, 2008; World 
Health Organization [WHO], 2011).

The Dakar Framework also called for greater 
accountability, with countries accountable to 
citizens. With much stronger influence from civil 
society organizations (CSOs) than at Jomtien, the 
framework specifically referred to a need to curb 
corrupt practices and increase the efficiency 
of domestic resources. CSOs had strong 
participation in the drafting of the framework, 
which pushed for greater commitments to 
EFA and regarded CSOs as key partners 
to hold governments accountable for their 
financial promises.

This chapter assesses the extent to which 
governments and donors have fulfilled the 
financial commitments of the Dakar Framework. 
The first part provides an overview of trends 
over time of domestic spending on education 

compared to what was committed at Dakar. It 
reviews the efficiency and equity of domestic 
public spending on education and considers the 
influence of CSOs in this regard. The second 
part considers trends in the last 15 years in aid 
disbursements to education and whether donors 
have fulfilled their pledges to increase funds to 
basic education and to countries most in need. 
It reviews the evolution of policies relating to aid 
effectiveness; explores the role of humanitarian 
aid, funding by NGOs and non-traditional 
financing; and mentions the need for improved 
diagnostic tools to assess education financing.

Trends in domestic expenditure 
to education

The Dakar Framework saw national governments 
as largely financing EFA: ‘Governments must 
allocate sufficient resources to all components 
of basic education. This will require increasing 
the share of national income and budgets 
allocated to education, and, within that, to 
basic education.’1 That expectation has been 
borne out even in regions dependent on aid: 
domestic public spending dwarfs external 
assistance. In sub-Saharan Africa, international 
aid per primary school age child was US$12 in 
2012, compared with US$136 from domestic 
resources (Table 8.1).

In 2006, the High Level Group on EFA proposed 
that governments should spend between 4% 
and 6% of GNP on education and that, within 
government budgets, between 15% and 20% 
should be earmarked for education, with a focus

domestic product (GDP).

FINANCEThe importance  
of domestic 
resource 
mobilization 
through taxes 
has been 
increasingly 
acknowledged

on basic education (UNESCO, 2006e, 2007c). 
One study identified a ‘healthy’ level of spending 
on education – which it put at 3.8% of GDP – as 
the minimum investment needed to ensure 
improvement in education outcomes, measured 
through higher completion rates and lower 
repetition rates (Bruns et al., 2003; Greenhill 
and Ali, 2013).

Are countries meeting these targets? The 
commitment to free primary education has 
increased primary school enrolment, requiring 
massive resources to fund additional teachers, 
classrooms, and teaching and learning 
materials. Governments have also needed to 
replace revenue lost by schools when primary 
schooling became free.

Countries have increased spending on 
education, with varied progress

Increasing education spending, as a share 
of national income, requires not just the 
commitment but also the sustained ability 
to generate revenue through effective tax 
systems. The importance of domestic 
resource mobilization through taxes has 
been increasingly acknowledged since the 
2002 Monterrey Consensus on Financing for 
Development. Initiatives such as the 2008 
African Tax Administration Forum and the 2010 
European Commission’s communication on 

tax and development further underscored the 
importance of mobilizing revenue through tax 
for the sustainable financing of development 
(Bhushan et al., 2013).

The experience of developed countries in the 
19th century illustrates that tax revenue, which 
made up to 8% of national income, made it 
possible only to fund basic functions – police, 
courts, army, foreign affairs and general 
administration – but not the provision of 
basic services such as education. Relatively 
rich nations took on broader responsibilities, 
including education, only after tax collection 
started improving early in the 20th century 
(Piketty, 2014). For countries to finance the 
MDGs, it is estimated at least 20% of national 
income must be raised in tax revenue (IMF et al., 
2011). With many low and lower middle income 
countries starting from a low tax base at the 
time of Dakar, meeting this target required and 
still continues to require much more effort. Since 
Dakar, tax revenue as a share of national income 
has grown on average by just 0.44% a year for 
the low and lower middle income countries 
where tax revenue has risen (Hearson, 2013).

However, while in 2000, 25 low and lower middle 
income countries collected less than 15% of 
national income through tax; this number 
decreased to 18 in 2012. Some countries – 
including Afghanistan, Central African Republic,

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 81025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportChanging national financial commitments to EFA since Dakar

Nigeria and Pakistan – collect 10% or less of 
their national income in tax.2 In Madagascar, 
the share decreased between 2000 and 2012. 
For other countries, the share increased; for 
example, in Nepal the share increased from 
8.7% to 13.9% (World Bank, 2014h).

If countries are to sustainably finance education, 
they need to commit both to mobilizing 
resources and prioritizing education. Among 67 
countries analysed in the 2013/14 GMR, 37 raised 
insufficient revenue and committed less than 
20% of government budget on education. But 
with modest effort, the 67 countries could have 
raised an additional US$153 billion for education 
by 2015 by making tax collection more efficient, 
limiting tax exemptions, fighting tax evasion, 
diversifying the tax base and strengthening tax 
systems (UNESCO, 2014c).

Progress in prioritizing education is mixed. 
Globally, the median amount devoted to 
education as a share of GNP was equivalent 
to 5% in 2012. For low income countries, the 
median average was 4%. Of 142 countries with 
data, 96 spent 4% or more of GNP on education 
(including 14 low income and 18 lower middle 
income countries) and of these 96 countries, 39 
spent 6% or more on education. Many of the 116 
countries with data increased their commitment 
to education – 38 by one percentage point or 
more of GNP between 1999 and 2012 (of which 
10 were low income and 13 lower middle income) 
– though 13 reduced education spending by the 
same increment (Figure 8.1).

Education expenditure did not always keep 
pace with economic and enrolment growth

Despite the global financial crisis of 2007/08, 
the period after Dakar brought robust economic 
growth rates for many low and middle income 
countries. Economic growth over 1999–2012 
was accompanied by real growth in public 
expenditure on education (Table 8.2). Economic 
growth averaging 4.0% in sub Saharan Africa 
was outpaced by growth in public expenditure on 
education averaging 6.1% a year. By contrast, in 
South and West Asia annual economic growth 
between 1999 and 2012 averaged 4.5%; public 
expenditure on education grew slightly more 
at 4.9% per annum. Around two-thirds of the 
annual growth in public education spending 
in sub-Saharan Africa between 1999 and 
2007 was attributable to economic growth 
(Fredriksen, 2010)

However, these regional averages mask huge 
variations among countries. In the case of 
South and West Asia, for instance, in four out 
of the five countries with data in the region, 
annual growth in education spending did not 
exceed that of economic growth. The annual 
rate of economic growth in Pakistan was 
4.1% yet growth in expenditure on education 
was just 2.5%, reducing the share of GNP 
spent on education in 2012 to just 2%. Nepal 
was the exception, with annual growth in 
education spending just below 9% per annum 
as compared to 4.1% for economic growth. 
As a consequence, the share of GNP spent on

education increased from 2.9% to 4.7% between 
1999 and 2010. There were similar variations in 
sub-Saharan Africa. Growth in annual spending 
on education outpaced that of economic growth 
in a number of countries including Benin, 
Burundi and Kenya. In others including the 
Central African Republic and Sierra Leone, 
spending on education did not keep pace with 
economic growth. Globally, of the 100 countries 
with data, the rates of growth in education 
spending exceeded or kept pace with economic 
growth in 64. 

In most countries, greater per capita income 
is positively correlated with greater spending 
per primary school age child. However, the 
extent to which change in the former may affect 
the latter varies widely, as does the pace. In 
Malawi, despite increasing per capita income, 
expenditure per primary school age pupil 
declined (World Bank, 2010b), going from 10.2% 
of GNP per capita to 7.6% between 1999 and 
2011. By contrast, in Brazil, the share increased 
from 10.4% to 20.2% in 2010. Of the 56 countries 
with data, 40 increased their primary expenditure 
per pupil as a share of GNP per capita. Of the 

16 countries which decreased the share, 9 were 
in sub-Saharan Africa, the region with the lowest 
expenditure per primary school child.

The decade after Dakar saw large increases 
in enrolment following the abolition of primary 
school fees. However, these did not always 
correspond to positive changes in per pupil 
funding. In Niger, despite increased total public 
expenditure on education as a share of GNP, 
expenditure per primary school pupil fell over 
the decade from US$207 to US$130; spending 
did not keep pace with enrolment. By contrast, 
Nepal increased per pupil spending from US$68 
to US$174 between 1999 and 2009 while making 
primary education universal by 2011. Similarly, 
Benin increased per pupil spending at primary 
level during a period when primary enrolments 
more than doubled. Malawi, on the other hand, 
decreased spending per pupil from US$74 to 
US$54, during a period of larger numbers of 
children enrolling into the primary system. Chile 
exemplified many Latin American countries, 
where per pupil expenditure increased, but this 
was partly because primary school enrolment 
fell (Figure 8.2).

FINANCEEducation is not a priority in many budgets

As a share of government spending, expenditure 
on education has changed little since 1999. In 
2012 the world median average was 13.7%, 
falling short of the 15% to 20% target. Sub-
Saharan Africa is where countries have allocated 
the largest median share of government 
expenditure to education (18.4%), followed by 
East Asia and the Pacific (17.5%). South and 
West Asia allocated only 12.6% (Table 8.1). Of the 
129 countries with data, 53 devoted 15% or more 
of total government expenditure to education in 
2012; of these, 12 were low income and 17 lower 
middle income countries. Of the 53 countries 
spending 15% or more of total government 
expenditure to education, 20 spent 20% or more; 

of the 15 of these with comparable data for 
1999 and 2012, 8 – including Ethiopia and Niger 
– started below 20% in 1999 but by 2012 were 
allocating 20% or more (Figure 8.3). 

A low share of education budgets is  
allocated to pre-primary education

As a share of total public government 
expenditure on education, global median 
spending on pre-primary education made up 
only 4.9% in 2012.3 North America and Western 
Europe allocated 8.8% of education budgets on 
pre-primary education while sub-Saharan Africa 
spent 0.3%. Of 51 countries with available data in 
1999 and 2012, 37 increased public expenditure 
on pre-primary education as a share of GNP

3. UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) data used for this section on 
domestic spending refer to ‘pre-primary education’ which is to be considered 
interchangeable with early childhood care and education services.

over the period. Disaggregated by income, the 
differences are notable. Among 22 high income 
countries, 18 increased the pre-primary share 
of education budgets. Of the nine low and lower 
middle income countries, five – including Benin, 
the Plurinational State of Bolivia and the United 
Republic of Tanzania – increased their share 
(Figure 8.4).

Some governments have tried to compensate 
for the low share of public resources for pre-
primary education with special efforts to reach 
the poorest children. In Chile, pre-primary 
education is offered through a mix of public 
and government-subsidized private providers; 
in 2011, government subsidies for all enrolled 
students increased by 15% alongside a goal of 

universal coverage by 2014 for 4- and 5-year-
olds in the bottom three income quintiles 
(OECD, 2013b). Public spending on pre-primary 
education as a share of GNP doubled from 
0.3% in 1999 to 0.6% in 2012. In 2002, Indonesia 
amended its constitution to require allocating at 
least 20% of the national budget to education. 
In 2008, the government launched the Early 
Childhood Education and Development Project 
in 3,000 poor villages. Grants of US$18,000 
per village were disbursed over three years to 
establish two pre-primary education centres 
(Jung and Hasan, 2014). In 2012, Peru launched 
the Cuna Más programme to improve pre-
primary education which currently reaches over 
62,000 children under 3 in poor areas (Klaus, 
2013). However, at all country income levels,

public spending on pre-primary education as a 
share of GNP continues to be low. Of the 27 sub-
Saharan African countries with data, median 
public expenditure on pre-primary education as 
a share of GNP was just 0.01% in 2012.

There is wide variation in funding  
trends for primary education

The EFA and MDG targets on education 
emphasized the need to expand free primary 
education of good quality, demanding greater 
investment and priority for primary education 
budgets. The focus on primary education 
expenditure reflects this. Of the 56 countries 
with data on primary education spending as a 
share of total public expenditure on education 
in both 1999 and 2012, just 16 increased the 
share. Low income countries did better: 6 of the 

11 countries with data – Bangladesh, Burundi, 
Chad, Nepal, Niger and Togo – increased 
expenditure on primary education as a share 
of GNP. All six reprioritized primary education 
in the total education budget. In Nepal, strong 
government commitment led to the share of 
primary education in total public expenditure 
on education rising from nearly 53% in 1999 
to 60% in 2012, accompanied by increases 
in net primary enrolment ratio from 69% to 
98%, illustrating the links between the two. 
In all but one of the six countries, the share 
of the public education budget earmarked for 
tertiary education decreased, which may reflect 
redistribution efforts.

Malawi, one of five low income countries 
that decreased their share of total education 
spending on primary education, allocated less

than 37% of the budget to primary education 
in 2011, down from nearly 61% in 1999. The 
country’s primary completion and learning 
outcomes are among the worst in sub-
Saharan Africa. The decrease largely benefited 
secondary and tertiary education; 26% of the 
education budget was distributed to the tertiary 
level in 2011, where per student spending 
amounts to US$11,129. Subsidizing higher 
education in Malawi perpetuates wide inequity: 
more than 90% of university students are from 
the wealthiest quintile (World Bank, 2010b).

In 2012, the median share of primary education 
in total public education expenditure was 50% 
on average, in 22 low income countries. While 
primary education accounted for the largest 
share of public education expenditure in most 
low income countries, there was great variation 

among countries of similar income levels, 
ranging from Ethiopia’s allocation of of nearly 
65% of its education budget to primary education 
to Rwanda’s almost 36%.

Of the 61 countries with data for 1999 and 2012 
on primary education spending as a share 
of national income, 33 raised their share. 
The 33 included 9 low income countries and 
11 middle income countries. Of the 28 countries 
where spending stagnated or the latter 
stagnated or decreased, a majority were high or 
upper middle income. However, there were also 
reductions in six low and lower middle income 
countries, including Malawi, where, worryingly, 
spending on primary education was already 
low and declined from 2.5% to 1.8% between 
1999 and 2011.

FINANCEIn many poor countries, teacher salaries make 
up the largest share of primary school budgets

Global data for 2012 show that in a majority of the 
57 countries with data, the greatest share of the 
primary education recurrent budget was allocated 
to teachers’ salaries. For the 37 low and middle 
income countries included in the analysis, this left 
few resources for other areas (Figure 8.5). As a 
share of total public current spending on primary 
education in low and lower middle income 
countries, salaries averaged 82% of the budget.  
In high income countries, the average was 64%.

Rapid increases in levels of enrolment at primary 
level led to demand for more teachers in low 
income countries. But this has occurred in an 
environment antithetical to spending on teacher 
salaries. An International Monetary Fund (IMF) 
loan criterion for 17 countries in 2003–2005, 
relating to structural adjustment programmes, 
was a ceiling on wages (ActionAid, 2007). While 
the IMF later stated it had removed the criterion, 
there was still pressure on governments behind 
the scenes to reduce wage spending (Oxfam 
International, 2011). The global financial crisis 
of 2007/08 led to a spike in IMF lending carrying

of years of compulsory schooling was raised, 
the Emergency Training Scheme produced some 
35,000 teachers after the war by condensing 
teacher training into one year (Crook, 1997).

In response to teacher shortages and general 
resource limitations, many South and West 
Asian and sub-Saharan African countries rapidly 
recruited contract teachers (see Chapter 6), 
mainly for rural areas and remote locations. 
The situation has some similarity to that in the 
United Kingdom after the Second World War:

In West Africa, contract teachers were estimated 
to make up half the teaching force in the mid-
2000s (Kingdon et al., 2013). Contract teachers 
are usually paid less than their civil servant 
counterparts. An often-cited target is that 
teacher salaries should be 3.5 times GDP per 
capita (Bermingham, 2004; Bruns et al., 2003); in

FINANCEthe target was met for civil servant teachers, 
but it was met for contract teachers in only 
5 countries (IIEP-Pôle de Dakar database).4 The 
policy of hiring contract teachers at a fraction of 
what it costs to hire teachers on a civil service 
wage raises equity concerns. Contract teachers 
are often deployed in remote regions, which tend 
to serve more disadvantaged students (Kingdon 
et al., 2013), indicating that less is spent per 
child in such areas.  

Little is spent on areas outside of salary  
to meet quality and efficiency goals

To meet the universal primary education goal 
on quality and efficiency, a 2003 study for the 
World Bank together with the 2004 indicative 
framework for the Fast Track Initiative (FTI) 
recommended that to reach acceptable levels 
of quality and efficiency, one-third of primary 
recurrent spending, which includes spending 
on learning and teaching materials, should 
be earmarked for non-salary expenditure 
(Bermingham, 2004; Bruns et al., 2003). 
Domestic public investment is not achieving this, 
as the limited data available clearly illustrate. In 
2012, in the 36 countries with data, the average 
share of the primary education recurrent 
budget spent on textbooks and other teaching 
and learning materials was less than 2%; 
16 countries spent less than 1%. Only Kuwait  
and Malawi spent close to 5% or more.

Non-salary expenditure is important for the 
quality and efficiency of learning. The Dakar 
Framework called for ensuring that everything 
possible was done to reduce or eliminate 
costs, such as those for learning and teaching 
materials. It is largely accepted that such 
materials contribute to the quality of learning. 
Teaching and learning materials are especially 
relevant in low income countries with large class 
sizes, a high proportion of unqualified teachers 
and thus reduced hours of contact between 
teachers and students (Read and Bontoux, 2014). 
They are also in some cases a more cost-effective 
investment than training teachers (see Chapter 6).

Donors have tried to improve materials 
provision by supporting government financing 
or increasing the capacity of local publishing, 
but a lack of financing for materials persists. 
The lack of school-provided textbooks in sub-
Saharan Africa has meant parents often pay for 

them (Read and Bontoux, 2014). One study of 
12 African countries showed that school supplies 
made up 34% of total household spending 
on education. School supplies and learning 
materials accounted for 56% of education 
expenditure by households in the poorest 
quintile, rising to almost 75% in Mauritania and 
Niger (Pôle de Dakar, 2012).

Another striking aspect of teaching and learning 
materials is the wide variation in textbook costs. 
Per unit costs range from US$2 to US$4 in most 
sub-Saharan African countries (Fredriksen and 
Tan, 2008), compared with US$0.33 to around 
US$0.66 in Viet Nam; printing in-country and 
competition between publishers has driven 
down prices. In sub-Saharan Africa, extra 
costs relating to factors such as delivery lead 
to large variations. Both Kenya and Rwanda 
use commercial distribution to deliver books to 
schools, but Rwandan publishers deliver directly; 
the unit cost of a grade 1 book in Kenya, where 
books go through a bookseller, is 50% higher 
(Read and Bontoux, 2014).

A majority of countries increased spending  
on secondary education

While the focus has been on pre-primary and 
primary education due to their prominence in 
the EFA goals, changes in public secondary 
spending deserve mention. The high numbers 
of children transitioning to secondary education 
warrant extra resources for that level. Among 
the 61 countries with data for public spending 
on secondary education as a share of national 
income in both 1999 and 2012, 38 increased 
expenditure on secondary education. Of these, 
15 were low and lower middle income countries, 
including Rwanda, where the government set 
a goal of universal secondary education with 
fee-free secondary education due to commence 
in 2012, addressing government concerns over 
transition rates from basic education5 to upper 
secondary (World Bank, 2013f).

Efficient governance of education budgets 
and the role of non-state actors

In the past decade, there has been greater 
involvement of citizens in budget and spending 
processes. Reasons include higher growth and 
capacity of CSOs and an increased emphasis 
on good governance principles. This trend has

helped ensure that the areas with the greatest 
need are targeted effectively (Khagram et al., 
2013). At the same time, partnerships promoting 
‘open data’6 have emerged, along with public 
expenditure surveys to minimize waste of 
resources through greater transparency and 
accountability. Since Dakar, numerous examples 
have arisen of governments and CSOs working 
towards these ends (IBP, n.d.; Open Government 
Partnership, n.d.).

CSOs have helped address corruption, but it 
continues to be a drain

The Dakar Framework noted, ‘Corruption is a 
major drain on the effective use of resources 
for education and should be drastically curbed.’ 
In Nigeria, at least US$21 million of education 
funding was lost over two years; in Kenya, 
US$48 million was lost over five (Transparency 
International, 2013). Numerous studies point 
to the negative correlation between corruption 
and the quality of public services, including 
education. Student dropout rates, for instance, 
were five times higher in countries with high 
levels of corruption than in countries with little 
or no corruption (Rose-Ackerman, 2006).

Corruption affecting education budgets may 
not be detected because monitoring systems 
in many countries are poor and a huge 
amount of resources are disbursed through 
complex administrative layers (Transparency 
International, 2013). Budget processes can lack 
transparency, with little access to or scrutiny 
of information on the delivery of resources. 
Extreme deviation can exist between the 
allocation of funds and the final execution of 
budgets (Simson and Welham, 2014).

CSOs have played an important role in 
countering corrupt practices. In a Bangladesh 
subdistrict, community audit groups used budget 
tracking to reveal that the state and quality of 
buildings did not reflect a stated expenditure 
of US$146 per school for infrastructure 
development (Global Campaign for Education et 
al., 2013). CSOs in Uganda empowered ordinary 
citizens, including schoolchildren, to detect 
possible corruption in the day-to-day practices 
of schools, and thus also raised awareness 
and a sense of community ownership (Global 
Campaign for Education et al., 2013). Misuse of 

Changing national financial commitments to EFA since Dakar

budgeted funds for education has been exposed 
to the media in 8 of the 16 countries in which the 
Commonwealth Education Fund works (Global 
Campaign for Education et al., 2008).

Procurement of teaching and learning materials is 
closely associated with practices such as bribery, 
overpricing, unaccounted-for spending and 
underdelivery. High volumes of money are involved 
in contracts awarded for teaching and learning 
materials (Transparency International, 2013). 
The international book publishers Macmillan 
and Oxford University Press were found guilty of 
trying to bribe officials in tenders for educational 
materials in East Africa in 2009 and 2010, 
respectively (Transparency International, 2013). 
In Malawi, the Civil Society Education Coalition 
found that learning and teaching materials had 
appeared in the budget but not been procured for 
four consecutive budget years; the resources had 
instead been used to service a US$128 million 
debt (Global Campaign for Education et al., 2013). 
A partnership between government and civil 
society in the Philippines addressed corruption 
in the procurement and delivery of learning and 
teaching materials (Box 8.1).

Box 8.1: Reducing corruption in the 
textbook sector in the Philippines

In the late 1990s, textbooks were not reaching students 
and those that were delivered were of poor quality. Some 
40% of textbook deliveries could not be accounted for. 
Illegal payments to government officials amounted to 
between 20% and 65% of the public education budget 
earmarked for textbooks. Corruption and abuse of power 
were endemic. The National Textbook Delivery Program, 
rolled out in 2003, helped improve transparency in 
textbook delivery and distribution, aiming to increase 
accountability over the full procurement cycle, from 
bidding to production to final delivery. The programme 
was mandated to ensure, before distribution, that private 
publishers provided books of the right quality and 
quantity. The role of civil society was to make sure the 
correct quantities of books were disbursed and delivered 
to schools according to schedule.

Working with eight CSOs, the programme was able to 
monitor the bidding process for US$30 million worth of 
textbooks and their distribution to 5,500 locations in 
60 provinces. The average cost of one textbook dropped 
from US$2.02 to US$0.80, and distribution delays were 
significantly reduced. The CSOs, checking books during 
quality control, rejected 100,000. Savings from reforms 
amounted to US$1.84 million.

FINANCE‘Ghosts’ are another issue: schools and teachers 
that exist only in official records. Ghost teachers 
have either moved on or died, but the teacher 
or their school continues to draw a government 
salary; they can also refer to teachers who 
never existed in the first place. In Pakistan, 
where education was perceived to be the fourth 
most corrupt sector in 2010, this problem is 
endemic. The government estimated there were 
6,480 ghost schools in Sindh province and 5,000 
in Balochistan (Transparency International, 
2013). In Sierra Leone, after a 2008 Ministry of 
Education survey revealed large numbers of 
ghost teachers, the government began verifying 
payrolls by collecting photo identification of 
teachers and their teaching location, and getting 
corroboration from other teachers (Turrent, 
2012). As of 2012 Sierra Leone had rooted out 
1,000 ghost teachers with the aid of the Anti-
Corruption Commission, and the Ministry of 
Education, Youth and Sports reported that over 
US$195,000 had been retrieved from corrupt 
schools in 2010 (Turrent, 2012).

The continued costs of corruption in education, 
despite action over the past decade, have largely 
been borne by the poor, who often have less 
choice in access to services outside the public 
sector (OECD, 2014j). They may also be borne 
disproportionally by girls: where access to basic 
services requires a bribe, females are more likely 
to be denied access, as they have less control of 
monetary resources than males do (ICAI, 2014). 
One result may be that girls are less likely to 
attend school than boys or to receive a good 
quality education through, for example, private 
tutoring when the quality of public education is 
poor (Transparency International, 2010). Gender-
responsive budgeting (see Chapter 5) is one 
means of addressing corruption in the provision 
of basic public services. In Mexico, a gender-
responsive budget initiative uncovered where 
public funds had gone missing in resources 
intended for women’s needs in the health sector 
(Nawaz, 2009).

Efficiency of public spending on education 
continues to be a challenge

Efficiency of spending can refer to both whether 
resources are spent as planned and whether 
they are spent where they would achieve the 
best possible outcome. The Dakar Framework 
stated: ‘Resources have to be used with much 

greater efficiency and integrity.’ A recent IMF 
paper calculated that, in developing countries, 
more efficient spending in secondary education 
could increase average enrolment rates by 
36%. Policy interventions to this end include 
reducing high pupil–teacher ratios, improving 
the quality of institutions and reducing income 
inequality (Grigoli, 2014). With most public 
spending on education going towards teachers’ 
salaries, some forms of teacher behaviour 
impede efficient spending. A recent study found 
that primary school teachers in some African 
countries were absent 15% to 25% of the time, 
and that teachers who were present were not 
always teaching, leading to students having less 
engaged learning or on-task time (World Bank, 
2010a). A 20% reduction in teacher absenteeism 
in Uganda would be the equivalent of hiring 
an additional 5,000 teachers (Winkler and 
Sondergaard, 2008).

Deviation between planned and actual budget 
expenditure may be one reason for the weak 
causal relationship between spending on specific 
school inputs and related outcomes, current 
literature on education financing suggests 
(World Bank, 2013g). It also means budgets are 
not a credible reference for other stakeholders, 
such as external donors and the private sector, 
on how much and where to invest in education 
(Addison, 2012). This deviation could be due to 
a combination of factors, including inaccurate 
forecasting of revenue and expenditure, lack of 
compliance by executing agents and intentional 
misrepresentation for the benefit of certain 
key stakeholders (Simson and Welham, 2014). 
Liberia’s 2012 education spending exceeded 
the budget by 8% (Figure 8.6). However, much 
wider deviation emerges from disaggregating 
spending levels: just 27% of what was allocated 
to secondary education was spent, while 
spending on administration and management 
was 3.3 times over what was originally budgeted 
(Simson and Welham, 2014).

Inefficient timing can also mean inefficient 
spending. Delays in textbook distribution owing 
to slow disbursal of resources can hinder 
learning but remain common in many developing 
countries when resources are lacking at the 
start of the school year (World Bank, 2013g). 

Poor predictability of both the timing and amount 
of funding continues to hinder efficient planning

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 81025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportChanging national financial commitments to EFA since Dakar

by teachers and school management committees. 
In India, the elementary education budget 
increased more than twofold between 2007/08 
and 2012/13 (Accountability Initiative, 2013). While 
it is commendable that per pupil spending in 
the poorest districts increased under the Sarva 
Shiksha Abhiyan (Education for All) programme, 
schools in the poorest districts still lack the 
capacity to spend when and where needed 
(UNESCO, 2014c). In Bihar, one of the poorest 
states in India, per pupil spending increased by 
27% between 2011/12 and 2012/13 compared to 
the national average of 5% over the same period. 
However, Bihar spent just 38% of its allocations in 
2011/12 vs 62% at the national level. 

Inefficient planning means expenditure does not 
always match needs; rigid earmarking of funds 
prevents schools from spending in the areas 
that could have the greatest impact on learning 

(Accountability Initiative, 2013). The Programa 
Escuelas de Calidad, introduced in Mexico in 
2001, addressed this problem by giving more 
autonomy to schools, with each receiving a five 
year grant of up to US$15,000. As a consequence 
of more spending autonomy for schools alongside 
other factors, dropout, failure and repetition rates 
decreased. In Nepal, similarly, responsibility 
for school management was transferred to the 
community. Schools were given untied block 
grants allowing management committees more 
control over discretionary spending, resulting in 
improved access and equity (Bruns et al., 2011). 

Inefficient spending often means children drop 
out before completing primary school, further 
contributing to waste of public resources. The 
2013/14 GMR reported that of the 250 million 
children not learning the basics in reading and 
mathematics, 130 million stayed in primary

school at least four years without achieving the 
minimum benchmarks for learning (UNESCO, 
2014c). The implications for resources are 
serious: when a child repeats a grade, the 
government pays double or more what it would 
cost if there were no repetition. A child dropping 
out of primary school before learning the basics 
will still have used finite government resources. 
In Malawi, 65% of public resources for primary 
education were spent on pupils who repeated 
grades or dropped out before completing the 
primary cycle in 2007 (World Bank, 2010b). 
Consequently, rather than an ideal of 8 years to 
fund a primary school graduate, the government 
spent the equivalent of 23, and that was up from 
20 years in 2000 (Figure 8.7).

Many studies have documented the effectiveness 
of pre-primary education programmes in reducing 
education costs by improving the internal 
efficiency of primary education (see Chapter 1).

are less likely to repeat primary grades and make 
better progress through grades than their non-
attending peers. A growing body of evaluations 
indicates that pre-primary education has a strong 
potential to generate government savings, with 
returns to society far outpacing government 
expenditure. The high benefits associated with 
pre-primary education have led governments in 
Cameroon, Chile, Colombia, Ghana and Kenya 
to expand budget allocations to early child 
development across multiple line ministries (The 
Consultative Group on Early Childhood Care and 
Development, 2008).

CSOs have helped make public education 
spending more transparent

Decision-making on budget formulation and 
expenditure has traditionally been restricted 
to finance ministries, with other ministries, 
business, CSOs and the broader community 
having little or no access. This has led to 
demands for transparency, participation and 
accountability, particularly in light of corruption 
and inefficiency in education systems and 
failures to deliver basic services despite 
more investment.

Greater access to information can serve ‘as 
a stimulant for public action, as a catalyst 
for change, and as an input for making other 
reforms work’ (World Bank, 2004). The Dakar 
Framework called for ‘the engagement and 
participation of civil society in the formulation, 
implementation and monitoring of strategies for 
educational development’.

Since Dakar, CSOs have grown in number and 
capacity, and actively seek to participate in 
government decision-making. In 1997, just 6 civil 
society groups working on budget-related issues 
as part of their policy advocacy participated in 
international efforts to advocate for increased 
fiscal transparency; by 2011 the number had 
grown to nearly 100 (Khagram et al., 2013). 
The International Budget Partnership, set 
up in 1997, initiated the Open Budget Survey, 
which is carried out every two years to gauge 
levels of budget transparency; the 2012 survey 
covered 100 countries. More recently, the Open 
Government Partnership, founded in 2011, 
aims to secure firm government commitments 
to promote more open, responsive and 
democratic governance, including increasing 

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 81025Education for All Global Monitoring Reportbudget transparency. Over 64 governments have 
joined and have made over 2,000 commitments 
to make their governments more transparent 
and accountable (Open Government Partnership, 
n.d.). The Commonwealth Education Fund 
works with civil society in the 16 countries 
most at risk of missing the MDGs on education 
and gender. As a result of its work, copies of 
education budgets have been distributed to over 
6 million people, and close to half a million have 
received training to work on education budgets 
(Global Campaign for Education et al., 2008).

The impact of civil society has been impressive, 
from improving participation in budget-related 
decision-making to using data in the public 
domain to analyse budgets in the education 
sector. Successes since Dakar include lobbying 
for a greater share of the national budget to go 
to education in Liberia and Malawi; formalizing 
CSO participation in budget processes in Burkina 
Faso; influencing improved accountability and 
transparency in public expenditure in Zambia; 
and influencing policy to emphasize indigenous 
rights in the Plurinational State of Bolivia and 
early childhood care and education in Ethiopia 
(CIDA, 2012; Global Campaign for Education, 
2012b, 2012c).

Civil society influence goes beyond advocacy 
to increase resources for education to 
holding governments to account. In India, the 
Accountability Initiative has shown through 
annual publications that despite increased 
resources for elementary education, the poorest 
districts in India are not improving learning 
outcomes (Accountability Initiative, 2014). The 
government should be credited for recognizing 
the failure to achieve learning outcomes, despite 
increased resources being made available. An 
overarching goal within the 12th National Plan 
is to achieve improved learning outcomes; this 
will require the government to ensure that its 
delivery system – including the execution of 
budgetary resources – focuses on outcomes 
(Accountability Initiative, 2013). 

CSOs have also been at the forefront in 
pressuring for more resources for marginalized 
groups. Gender-responsive budgeting (see 
Chapter 5) is a crucial approach to better 
understand the differential impact of budgets on 
boys and girls (Unterhalter, 2007). The National 
Education Coalition in Ghana has had some

success in integrating issues related to gender 
into budget work plans (Global Campaign for 
Education, 2012a). HakiElimu, founded in the 
United Republic of Tanzania in 2001, focuses on 
issues relating to teacher training and housing 
and capitation grant expenditure. After it trained 
parliamentarians in budget analysis for the 
2012/13 budget, they directed the Ministry of 
Education to incorporate HakiElimu’s proposed 
budget changes (Carlitz and McGee, 2013). 
Asociación Civil por la Igualdad y la Justicia in 
Argentina concluded that between 2002 and 
2005, 32% of allocated resources had not been 
spent, mobilizing legislative action to improve 
the efficiency of public spending on education 
(Basch, 2011).

Equity and inclusiveness in 
education expenditure

It is not enough to simply allocate more domestic 
resources to education; the resources must 
be equitably spent. This entails identifying and 
targeting public spending towards those groups 
furthest from meeting the EFA goals and avoiding 
spending the bulk of resources on education 
levels likely to only be accessed by the elite.

Targeting the marginalized through funding 
formulas has had mixed success

Achieving the Education for All goals requires 
an increase in domestic resources for education 
and simultaneously ensuring that expenditure 
helps to improve educational attainment for the 
most marginalized and hardest to reach, such 
as the poorest, those with disabilities, those 
living in remote locations and those from ethnic 
minorities. In most cases, the resources needed 
to reach children from these groups are likely to 
be much higher than the average cost per student 
necessary to mitigate the disadvantage they 
face. Domestic resources should be distributed 
accordingly (UNESCO, 2014c). 

The long-term social and economic benefits 
of targeting public resources towards the 
marginalized far outweigh the costs. In 
Bangladesh, the reductions in wage earnings 
due to lower levels of education for people with 
disabilities are estimated to cost the economy 
US$26 million per year; a further US$28 million 
is lost when children forgo schooling to care 
for a disabled person (World Bank, 2008a).

FINANCEAnother study showed how schooling could close 
the poverty gap between people with and without 
disabilities: across 14 developing countries, an 
additional year of schooling completed by an 
adult with a disability reduced the probability 
of their being in the poorest two quintiles by 
between 2% and 5% (Filmer, 2008).

However, many countries continue to disburse 
funding on the basis of equal amounts per 
child, thereby failing to take into account 
differences among schools, regions and the 
needs of disadvantaged groups. Some countries, 
however, have redressed this problem by 
targeting spending in favour of disadvantaged 
groups, which has resulted in more equitable 
learning outcomes, including through the use 
of conditional cash transfers for marginalized 
groups (see Chapter 2). Other governments 
have addressed the targeting of resources to 
the most disadvantaged by applying a funding 
formula for public resources to benefit the 
most disadvantaged (Levacic et al., 2000; 
OECD, 2012f).

Brazil, a pioneer in targeting resources to the 
most disadvantaged, has improved the equity 
of allocation for the poorer regions in the north 
and north-east through the Fund for Primary 
Education Administration and Development 
for the Enhancement of Teacher Status 
(FUNDEF) which seeks to ensure a minimum 
spending level per pupil (UNESCO, 2014c). 
In the Netherlands, disadvantaged students 
are identified so that learning support can be 
funded. As a result, the primary schools with the 
highest proportion of disadvantaged students 
have on average about 58% more teachers and 
support staff (Ladd and Fiske, 2009). Programme 
for International Student Assessment (PISA) 
tests show that the Netherlands combines 
high levels of performance alongside equity 
in education opportunities (OECD, 2014g). In 
Viet Nam, programmes emphasize a minimum 
standard of quality for schooling, focusing on 
disadvantaged communities and providing 
extra government resources to poorer districts. 
As a result, the share of children in the most 
disadvantaged district who answered a grade 
4 question correctly rose from 18% at the 
beginning of the school year to 47% at the end 
(Rolleston et al., 2013).

for in funding formula to promote equity, 
yet many do not. In South Africa, 86% of the 
primary budget is for salaries (Development 
Finance International, 2014) but its National 
Norms and Standards for School Funding, 
which aims to redistribute public resources 
to the poorest schools, only does this with the 
non-salary component of the recurrent budget. 
Redistribution is therefore limited. Meanwhile, 
pupil/teacher ratios remain high in poor schools, 
and inadequate access to financial resources, 
lack of textbooks and large class sizes continue 
to account for the poor performance of schools 
that traditionally have a large proportion of black, 
Indian or mixed-race children (Mestry, 2014). 
In 2004, Madagascar initiated a mechanism for 
effective distribution and equitable allocation of 
teachers, identifying which schools had severe 
teacher shortages and giving them higher 
priority when deploying newly trained teachers. 
Within just a year of this policy’s implementation, 
the percentage of teachers allocated according 
to need rose from 72% to 81% (Majgaard and 
Mingat, 2012). 

The state of school infrastructure is of similar 
importance in improving girls’ learning outcomes. 
In Burkina Faso, providing sufficient resources 
to schools in poor, underserved areas where 
amenities were typically not available benefited 
girls disproportionately. It increased their 
enrolment by 5% more than boys’ enrolment 
and improved the test scores of all children by 
0.41 standard deviations (Kazianga et al., 2013).

Education spending is regressive but 
has improved

The Dakar Framework called for governments 
to increase ‘the share of national income and 
budgets allocated to education, and, within that, 
to basic education’. Allocations need to reflect 
the current realities and characteristics of 
country education systems. For most low income 
countries, the rationale is strong for spending 
more on primary education, the level most likely 
to be accessed by children from poorer income 
households. Governments spending more on 
upper secondary and tertiary education, on the 
other hand, will most likely benefit children 
from higher income households and represent 
regressive spending.

As teacher salaries make up the majority of 
government spending, they need to be accounted

It has found, for example, that even though a 
majority of the population is rural in many low 
income countries, education resources continue 
to be skewed towards urban areas. In Rwanda, 
83% of the population resides in rural areas and 
yet receives 51% of total education resources 
(World Bank et al., 2011a). In the Gambia, the 
respective shares are 62% and 36% (World 
Bank et al., 2011b). This tool can also be used to 
identify inequity in spending on different levels of 
education, such as primary vs tertiary. One study 
illustrates that education spending was found 
to be more pro-poor in richer countries than in 
poorer countries in countries with available data. 
(Davoodi et al., 2010).

Changes in spending have been documented in 
countries including Congo and Nepal. In Congo, 
one of the world’s most inequitable countries, 
the benefit of public spending on education for 
the poorest decreased for primary education 
from 24% in 2005 to 21% in 2011. Within higher 
education, 57% of those enrolled in 2011 
were from households in the richest quintile, 
compared with 38% in 2005, with the benefit of 
spending on higher education for the poorest 
decreasing from an already low 4% in 2005 to 
0.5% in 2011; and yet 22% of the budget was 
allocated to higher education in 2011 (World 
Bank, 2014f). A benefit analysis of education 
spending for Nepal revealed, similarly, that in 
the financial year 2005/06, spending on primary 
education was more progressive and pro-
poor while spending on secondary and higher 
education was more regressive (PRAD, 2010). 
However, unlike in Congo, while expenditure 
still benefits children from the highest quintile 
households, the gap is closing (Figure 8.8). 
Nepal’s EFA National Plan of Action 2001–2015 
incorporated policy prescriptions for each of 
the six EFA goals with an emphasis on equity, 
aimed at specific disadvantaged groups (Karki, 
2014) to ensure that funding to them as a 
share of the total earmarked for education 
progressively increased.

On average in 2012, countries spent 12 times 
more per student in higher education than 
in primary school in sub-Saharan Africa, 
and 5 times more in South and West Asia. 
Extreme inequity in per capita spending 
between primary and higher education is most 
pronounced in poorer countries. Low income 
countries spent 11 times more per tertiary

student compared with primary, while high 
income countries spent 1.3 times more. In 
the countries that might be most expected to 
benefit the poor through public spending, the 
benefits of education, particularly at the levels 
attained primarily by the rich, continue to be 
received by the rich.

However, among the 36 countries with data on 
per student expenditure at the primary and 
tertiary levels over the Dakar period, the gulf 
narrowed for 30, of which 7 were in sub-Saharan 
Africa. In Rwanda in 1999, the government spent 
nearly 161 times as much on a tertiary student 
as on a primary school child; by 2012 the figure 
had declined to 12. In Peru, the 1999 expenditure 
per tertiary student was almost triple that per 
primary school child, but by 2012 the amounts 
were the same.

Inequity continues in disbursement of public 
resources among education subsectors. But 
the concentration of education spending in 
sub-Saharan Africa at higher levels has been 
steadily declining for three decades. While public 
spending is still inequitable, it has become 
less so, partly through the fee-free primary 
education introduced by many governments in

The percentage of public spending benefiting 
the 10% most educated was 63% in 1975, 
56% in 1992 and 43% in 2003 (Majgaard and 
Mingat, 2012). 

Households bolster the national education 
effort, especially when governments 
neglect spending

Globally, governments are the largest source of 
education financing, whether out of their own 
resources or through grants and loans from 
external sources. However, it is often overlooked 
that they are not the only source of education 
financing, and in some countries, usually poorer 
ones, they are not even the largest source.

GMR analysis shows that among 50 low, 
middle and high income countries in all 
regions with data for 2005–2012, household 
education spending accounted on average for 
31% of the total. In almost a quarter of the 
countries, households spent more on education 
than governments.

Household financing often makes up for the fact 
that some governments do not spend sufficient 
resources on education, or that despite fee-free 
public primary schooling being enshrined in law 
in 135 countries, 110 still continue to charge 
some sort of fee (Transparency International, 
2013). Among the 25 countries with the 
lowest amount of public finance of education, 
households contributed 42% of total expenditure, 
while among the 25 countries with the highest 
amount, households contributed 27%.

Households therefore play a considerable role. 
The proportion of public expenditure on education 
was less than 4% of GDP in 18 countries; when 
taking household financing into account, only 
two countries, Cambodia and Congo, fell below 
this threshold (Figure 8.9). This is important to 
take into account when reporting on the intensity 
of national efforts on education. The issue in 
many countries is not an insufficient national 
effort on education spending but that a large 
part of that effort is by households. The result is 
often an education system that is not sufficiently 
redistributive. In general, the poorer a country,

the 10 high income countries in the sample, 
household education expenditure accounted on 
average for 13% of the total, while among the 
14 low income countries it accounted for 49%.

The share of household contributions is by far 
highest in South Asian countries. In Bangladesh, 
Sri Lanka and Pakistan, where governments 
spend around 2% of GDP on education, 
households pay about 4% of GDP, which means 
that their contribution amounts to about two-
thirds of the total expenditure. By contrast, in 
five North American and Western European 
countries, the percentage is about 10%.

While such information is available, it is 
not sufficiently used by policy-makers for a 
comprehensive picture of education spending. 
This has had significant impact on the equity of 
education financing systems as discussed in the 
previous section.

Trends in aid to education

The Dakar Framework affirmed that ‘no 
countries seriously committed to Education for 
All will be thwarted in their achievement of this 
goal by a lack of resources.’ There was a strong 
expectation that the donor community would 
increase its financial support to education, 
specifically aligned to the objectives set out 
under the six EFA goals. In the years after Dakar, 
global donor commitments to raise aid levels, 
particularly for Africa, and to increase the focus 
on improving aid effectiveness were made at the 
2005 G8 summit in Gleneagles and at high-level 
forums on aid effectiveness in Rome, Paris, 
Accra and Busan.

In the years before the international community’s 
commitment to the Millennium Development 
Goals in 2000, the share of total aid committed 
to social sectors increased rapidly as more 
donors programmed aid towards MDG-related 
sectors. The share of total aid committed for 
these sectors rose from 31% in 1996 to 45% in 
2005 (a spike largely spurred by increases in aid 
resources to the health sector) before falling 
to 40% in 2011.7 From 2002 to 2012, the volume 
of aid grew by an average of 9% a year; aid 
resources disbursed for reproductive health rose 
by 16% annually and for water and sanitation by 
12% (OECD-DAC, 2014).

However, aid commitments to education as a 
share of total social sector aid essentially were 
the same before and after Dakar (OECD-DAC, 
2014).8 On average, aid to basic education grew 
by 6% a year. The share of total aid disbursed 
for education was static in the decade after 
Dakar, never exceeding 10%; by contrast, for 
health the share of total aid increased from 9% 
to 14%. Overall aid disbursed to education did 
increase steadily after Dakar until 2010, but has 
since been in decline. Total aid disbursements to 
education fell by 10% between 2010 and 2012, a 
total of US$1.3 billion less (OECD-DAC, 2014).

FINANCEthose of the health MDGs and that this was why 
education did not attract a larger share of the 
growing aid volumes over the decade (Burnett 
and Felsman, 2012) despite the Dakar call for 
funding agencies to allocate a larger share 
of their resources to primary and other basic 
education, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa 
and South Asia and among least developed 
countries and those emerging from conflict 
(UNESCO, 2000).

Aid disbursements by education level

International development assistance, like 
domestic expenditure, has focused on primary 
education, but there has also been significant 
spending on post-secondary education. Basic 
education,9 especially primary education, 
attracted donor support because it was directly 
related to poverty reduction and naturally linked 
to the education MDG. Secondary education 
benefited much less from rising aid even though 
more children transitioned to secondary and 
more trained primary teachers with secondary 
education were needed to achieve universal 
primary education (Lewin and Little, 2011). A 
review of donor strategies showed that only 
Germany, Japan and the Asian Development 
Bank treated upper secondary as a priority 
subsector in their aid programmes (Mercer, 
2014). Increased disbursements in post-
secondary education continue to be aligned with 
donors’ strategic interests, as they are seen as 
creating ties with countries’ future leaders.

Aid to basic education, which involves five of 
the six EFA goals, peaked over 2009 and 2010; 
between 2010 and 2012, its aid disbursements 
fell by 15%, or US$921 million (Table 8.3). 
This was a larger decline than for aid to 
post-secondary education, which fell by 6%. 
In absolute volumes, aid to post-secondary 
education was higher than that to basic in 2012. 
These proportions were similar to the shares of 
total aid to basic and post-secondary education 
in 2002, so in the end there was little change 
(OECD-DAC, 2014).

The large share of aid for post-secondary 
education, moreover, supports students from 

9. This refers to basic education as defined in the OECD Creditor Reporting 
System, comprising i) early childhood education, ii) primary education and iii) 
basic life skills for youth and adults.

developing countries studying in donor countries, 
rather than strengthening higher education 
systems in developing countries. About 72% of 
direct aid to post-secondary education in 2012 
was of the former type, up from 59% earlier 
in the decade (OECD-DAC, 2014). There is no 
guarantee that students studying in donor 
countries will return to contribute to their home 
countries once they complete their studies. 
In France, one-third of international students 
who come to study remain to work (Global 
Campaign for Education, 2013). In the early 
2000s, 20 out of 28 donor countries spent more 
on post-secondary education than on secondary 
education; in the late 2000s the respective 
figures were 27 out of 39, again indicating that 
little had changed (OECD-DAC, 2014).

Seven of the 15 largest donors to education 
actually increased the share of education 
aid going to post-secondary education and 
decreased the share to basic education over 
the decade. The European Union decreased 
its share of education aid for basic education 
from 50% to 43% in the period after Dakar and 
raised its share for post-secondary from 27% to 
36%. Other donors, however, including Australia 
and the United States, made commendable 
efforts to redistribute towards basic education 
(Figure 8.10). Among some donors, aid for 
post-secondary education is changing: Austria, 
Germany, Portugal and Spain now approach 
scholarships as part of broader efforts to 
strengthen higher education systems in partner 
countries (Mercer, 2014).

Not only did the share of education aid for 
post-secondary education rise, from 30% before 
Dakar to 40% after, but volume increases in aid 
for basic education have been almost entirely 
for primary education. Chronic underinvestment 
continues for EFA goals that fall outside primary 
education (Figure 8.11).

The narrow focus of the education MDG on 
universal primary education is one common 
explanation for why external funding for 
education has focused so heavily on primary 
education, to the neglect of other EFA goals. As a 
share of total disbursements to basic education, 
aid to basic life skills for youth and adults and to 
early childhood education has fallen. On average, 
their shares were 10% and 3%, respectively, 

7 of the 15 
largest donors 
increased the 
share of aid 
to tertiary at 
the expense 
of basic 
education

in 2002–2004 but 6% and 2% in 2010–2012 
(Figure 8.12). In 2012, for every US$1 disbursed 
in direct aid to early childhood care and 
education (ECCE),10 the equivalent of US$58 went 
to support students from recipient countries at 
the post-secondary level in donor countries.

Donor strategies focus little on other key EFA 
areas, including adult education, distance 
learning, non-formal education and education 
for children with special needs (Mercer, 2014). 
While Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, 
the European Union and UNICEF put a 
clear emphasis on ECCE (Mercer, 2014), aid 
disbursements to ECCE tell a different story 
for some of these donors. While the UK on 
average tripled education aid disbursements 
over the decade, its average volume of aid for 
ECCE in 2010–2012 amounted to US$4.4 million, 
that is, 0.4% of total aid to education for this 
period (OECD-DAC, 2014). The Department for 
International Development (DFID) recognizes 
the strong evidence of ECCE’s impact, but 
cites concern over the sustainability and 
cost-effectiveness of reaching the poorest 

(DfID, 2013). Similarly, the 1999 and 2006 World 
Bank strategies offer strong support for ECCE 
(World Bank, 1999, 2006) and yet just 6% of the 
institution’s basic education aid over the decade 
was for ECCE. The Netherlands, which at its 
peak in 2011 was the largest donor in volume 
terms to ECCE, has since completely stopped 
supporting education (OECD-DAC, 2014).

Aid disbursements by region

The Dakar Framework highlighted the need to 
allocate a larger share of aid to basic education 
in sub-Saharan Africa and South and West Asia. 
Aid to basic education in sub-Saharan Africa, 
home to over half of the world’s out-of-school 
children, grew steadily from 2002 then fell from 
2009 onwards. On average in 2002–2004, 47% of 
total aid disbursed to basic education was for 
sub-Saharan Africa, but by 2010–2012 the level 
had fallen to 31%.11 South and West Asia’s share 
of basic education stayed fairly constant, rising 
from 21% to 22% (OECD-DAC, 2014).

10. In this section, analysis on aid to ECCE refers to early childhood 
education.

11. This was in part due to a large increase in resources going to 
geographically unspecified areas.

While growth rates in aid disbursements for 
basic education to developing countries averaged 
6% a year, the sub-Saharan Africa region saw 
the second lowest annual average growth at 1% 
after Central and Eastern Europe (Figure 8.13), 
despite having the highest average returns to 
schooling (Psacharopoulos, 2014).

Aid disbursements to reach the poor

The premise behind aid is to help poor 
countries, which by default includes helping 
poor populations (Tomasi, 2014). Since Dakar, 
however, the correlation between poor countries 
and poor populations has weakened. The 
number of low income countries fell from 64 
in 2000 to 3712 in 2013 (World Bank, n.d.). As a 
consequence, while 93% of the world’s poor lived 
in low income countries at the beginning of the 
1990s, 72% lived in middle income countries in 
2012 (Kanbur and Sumner, 2011). Additionally, 
a larger proportion of the poor are likely to be 
increasingly concentrated in fragile states, not 
all of which are low income. These countries are 
expected to be furthest from reaching the MDGs

FINANCE36% of  
out-of-school 
children are 
in conflict-
affected states

and EFA goals in 2015, despite 35 fragile states 
being able to meet at least one of the goals by 
the set deadline (OECD, 2014e). Some estimates 
project that by 2018, fragile states will be home 
to more than one-half of the world’s poor; 
others, however, project that the majority of 
the poor will be in stable non-fragile middle 
income countries (Kanbur and Sumner, 2011; 
OECD, 2014e). In 2012, over half of out-of-school 
children (59%) were concentrated in middle 
income countries. Moreover, 36% of out-of-
school children are in conflict-affected states.

Donors have addressed the phenomenon of 
the changing geography of poverty in different 
ways. The United Kingdom has reduced the 

number of middle income countries it provides 
aid to, most notably phasing out aid to India by 
2015. Australia and Spain, on the other hand, 
have increased aid to middle income countries 
(Herbert, 2013). Though aid to middle income 
countries is a small share of overall public 
resources to finance development, some of its 
many forms can indirectly support increased 
equitable education spending. It is estimated 
that US$1 of official development aid spent on 
building tax administration capacity generates 
US$350 in tax revenue (Okojo-Iweala, 2013), yet 
just 0.1% of all aid disbursed is directed towards 
tax systems (IMF et al., 2011). Aid can support 
CSOs’ role and empower them to act as drivers 
of change for inclusive development.

aid for basic services – low income countries 
and fragile states – should not be left behind 
and, indeed, should be prioritized. However, the 
share of basic education aid disbursements 
going to low income countries actually declined 
from 40% to 34% over the decade. While the 
volume of basic education aid to upper middle 
income countries is comparatively lower in 
absolute terms, the annual growth rate of 
disbursements has been double that for low 
income countries: 10% vs 5% (OECD-DAC, 
2014). Moreover, levels of aid disbursed to low

aid per child over 2002–04, but by 2010–12 this 
aid was US$4 per child in Chad and US$44 in 
Afghanistan (Figure 8.14). Basic education aid 
disbursements per child in Chad declined, on 
average, by 6% a year over the decade while 
those in Afghanistan grew by an average of 23%.

The continuing importance of education aid

The importance of aid at the country level has 
declined in the past few years for developing 
countries where domestic resources have 
risen rapidly since Dakar. But aid remains 
crucial in low income countries, despite 
their robust growth, larger economies and 
higher government revenue. In many of these 
countries, government spending is still well 
below what is needed to ensure universal 
access to basic public services, including 
education (Development Initiatives, 2013). Many 
of the poorest countries, a decade after Dakar, 
continue to rely on external aid for 10% or more 
of their total public expenditure on education 
(Figure 8.15). 

Caution is needed in analysing this area. Aid 
dependence can be influenced by increasing 
domestic spending on education, falling aid 
levels or a combination of both. In 2012, in Chad, 
for instance, domestic primary expenditure per 
pupil amounted to US$53 while aid amounted to 
US$5 (OECD-DAC, 2014). While Chad appears 
to have become less dependent on aid, this 
is primarily because of the low levels of aid 
it receives. 

The changing landscape of aid since 2000

Aid provision was once the preserve of OECD 
donors, but since Dakar, emerging economies 
have been formalizing development cooperation 
through the creation of aid agencies. In 2013, 
Brazil announced the creation of an agency 
on cooperation, trade and investments. 
India launched its Development Partnership 
Administration in 2012. As with other donors, 
their commitment to development assistance 
appears to be tied to strategic drivers of 
cooperation such as trade and geopolitical 
influence. The significance of Brazil and India 
in volume of aid increased over the decade 
(World Bank, 2014h). They increasingly 
work through emerging, alternative global 
mechanisms such as the IBSA Facility for 
Poverty and Hunger Alleviation, created in 

Since Dakar,

Notes: Total domestic expenditure on education was calculated by multiplying the share of GDP spent on education by GDP data from the World Bank. To avoid double counting, the component of education aid for general 
budget support is excluded. Aid to education here excludes debt relief and aid that does not reach the recipient country.

2004 by Brazil, India and South Africa with an 
annual budget of US$3 million to help least 
developed and post-conflict countries reach 
the MDGs (Leite et al., 2014). More recently, the 
US$100 billion New Development Bank, launched 
by Brazil, China, India, Russia and South Africa, 
will finance infrastructure and sustainable 
development projects (Spratt, 2014).

While little public information is available on 
what emerging donors give to education, they 
support education in various ways. Brazil 
largely provides scholarships and international 
exchange programmes for students from partner 
countries, disbursing some US$174 million 
over 2005–2010 (Milani, 2014), but also 
supports partner countries with poor higher 
education systems through its Higher Education 
Coordination Agency’s CAPES programme, which 

in 2010 spent around US$5.3 million (Leite et al., 
2014). China recently published a white paper on 
foreign assistance indicating that between 2010 
and 2012, in relation to the education sector, it 
focused on constructing and maintaining school 
buildings, training teachers and offering almost 
77,000 scholarships for foreign students to study 
in China (Xiahuanet, 2014). Foreign scholarships 
are estimated to have more than tripled from 
US$119 million in 2009 to US$416 million in 
2012. Chinese aid for vocational training totalled 
US$68 million in 2012. Levels of assistance have 
risen sharply in recent years, and the trends are 
likely to continue (Reilly, 2014).

Debt relief

International aid and domestic resources are 
not the only ways to fund education. The Dakar 

268

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 81025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportFramework called for ‘providing earlier, more 
extensive and broader debt relief and/or debt 
cancellation for poverty reduction, with a strong 
commitment to basic education’. Since 1996, 
the Heavily Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) 
Initiative has targeted poor countries struggling 
to cope with high levels of external debt that 
claim resources otherwise destined for public 
spending. The Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative 
(MDRI), launched in 2005, aims to accelerate 
countries’ progress towards the MDGs once 
they complete the HIPC process (Cuaresma and 
Vincelette, n.d).

Since Dakar, debt relief has progressed for 
some of the poorest countries. MDRI debt 
relief from the four participating multilateral 
creditors was estimated at US$39.7 billion at 
the end of 2012 while under the HIPC Initiative, 
it was estimated at US$74.3 billion (IMF, 2013). 
HIPC and MRDI countries more than halved 
the share of GDP devoted to servicing debt 
from 3.9% in 2000 to 1.4% in 2011 (Prizzon and 
Mustapha, 2014). In 2000, 30 HIPC countries 
were spending more than 10% of government 
revenue on foreign debt repayment; by 2010, 
only Gambia and Togo were doing so (Jubilee 
Debt Campaign, 2012).

Social spending has clearly increased, though no 
robust direct link between debt cancellation and 
increased social spending has been established. 
However, countries which have qualified for 
debt relief have increased poverty reducing 
expenditure by almost 3.5 percentage points 
of GDP between 2001 and 2012 (IMF, 2013). In 
Ethiopia, which qualified for debt cancellation 
in 2004, debt repayment fell from an average of 
10% of government revenue in 1998–2000 to 4% 
in 2007–2009. Spending on health and education, 
meanwhile, increased from 22% of government 
revenue to 32% (Jubilee Debt Campaign, 2012).

The future is worrying, however. The rise 
in debt servicing by 2018 could equal more 
than half the education budget in Mauritania 
(60%) and Niger (53%) (Prizzon and Mustapha, 
2014). Also of concern is an upwards trend 
in development assistance in the form of 
loans. Most direct aid for education and basic 
education has been in the form of grants, but 
since 2009 non-concessional loans for education 
have significantly grown in volume, at a rate 
now surpassing growth of grants: data for 

International development assistance

2013 indicated that DAC bilateral aid in loans 
increased by 27.4% from 2012 while grants 
rose by 8.4% in real terms (OECD-DAC, 2014). 
If this trend continues it could have serious 
consequences for future levels of debt.

Donors have not met their commitment to 
deliver education aid more effectively

The period since Dakar has seen increased 
commitment to improve not just the quantity but 
also the governance of international aid. The 
Dakar Framework tasked donors with making 
aid more effective. The Paris Declaration on Aid 
Effectiveness in 2005 marked an unprecedented 
shift regarding how aid should be delivered, 
with an agenda promoting national ownership, 
alignment of donor priorities with national 
plans, coordination of donor efforts, a focus on 
results and shared accountability for outcomes 
between donors and recipients (UNESCO, 
2011a). Of 13 aid effectiveness targets, however, 
only that of aligning and coordinating technical 
assistance was achieved in 2010 (OECD, 2011a), 
indicating how difficult it is to change donor 
institutional behaviour.

More recently, the aid effectiveness agenda 
has increasingly emphasized new partnerships 
for development cooperation. The first High-
Level Meeting of the Global Partnership for 
Effective Development Cooperation, held in 
Mexico in April 2014, indicated a paradigm shift 
to a more inclusive agenda, with ‘strengthened 
mobilization of domestic resources and the 
convergence of efforts of all public and private 
development stakeholders at all levels’ (Global 
Partnership, 2014).

The lack of global aid architecture hinders 
effective donor coordination

Global coordination of aid for education is 
needed; the Dakar Framework called for 
facilitation of ‘more effective donor co-
ordination’. This would allow donors to 
strategically allocate aid for maximum impact, 
particularly where the need is greatest. It could 
also make the processes of donor governments, 
aid agencies and aid recipient countries 
less complex and confirm that the primary 
objective is to accelerate the development 
of education rather than strategic national 
interests (Fredriksen, 2012). But current global

FINANCEand country-level coordination mechanisms 
do not seem to have helped significantly (Rose 
et al., 2013).

Often governments use scarce resources to 
keep track of dozens of agencies and thousands 
of projects. One study estimated that better aid 
coordination could save the European Union 
(EU) EUR 8.4 billion a year; another put the 
potential annual savings at EUR 340 million 
(Mackie, 2013).

Advocacy for better coordination has grown in 
the past decade. Initiatives such as the 2007 
EU Code of Conduct on Complementarity 
and Division of Labour can promote 
coherent development policy through better 
coordination and harmonization, such as 
pooling of resources. In 2011, the New Deal for 
Engagement in Fragile States committed to 
better coordination of resources and reduced 
duplication, fragmentation and programme 
proliferation to ensure more efficient disbursal of 
international resources. Many donors, including 
Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, Sweden 
and the United Kingdom, have started reducing 
the number of countries and priority sectors to 
which they disburse aid.

Ineffective global and national coordination 
means the countries most in need of resources 
for education lack them. In Burkina Faso, 
Cambodia and Nicaragua, five donors providing 
a significant share of total basic education aid 
withdrew from the education sector (Abetti 
et al., 2011). The fourth High Level Forum 
on Aid Effectiveness in Busan, Republic of 
Korea, in 2011, stressed using multilateral 
institutions and global funds to reduce aid 
fragmentation and increase donor coordination 
efforts. However, most aid for basic education 
disbursed by bilateral donors continues to be 
earmarked by location and sector. The share of 
basic education aid disbursed by Development 
Assistance Committee (DAC) donors earmarked 
channels increased from 63% to 68% over 
the Dakar decade while aid not earmarked 
through multilateral channels decreased 
(OECD-DAC, 2014).

The GPE has become better able to target 
countries in need

The Global Partnership for Education (GPE) – 
formerly the Fast Track Initiative, established in 

2002, was the first global partnership focusing 
on education in developing countries, filling 
a vacuum in international leadership on this 
issue. It could play a critical role in the global 
coordination of education resources through 
international aid, but lacks the financial 
support to do this effectively. Instead, its 
strength and potential lie in its ability to target 
countries in need.

In volume terms, relative to other donors, 
the GPE has become an important source of 
external financing for basic education in some 
low and lower middle income countries. In 
2004, it was the 22nd largest basic education 
aid donor to low and lower middle income 
countries; by 2007 it was the ninth largest and 
in 2011 and 2012 it came fourth after the United 
Kingdom, United States and World Bank (GPE, 
2014a; OECD-DAC, 2014). Yet it accounts for 
a small proportion of aid. Between 2004 and 
2012, the GPE disbursed close to US$2 billion 
to low and lower middle income countries for 
basic education, compared with US$32 billion 
by OECD donors. It accounted for 12% of total 
external aid to education going to low income 
countries and 6% of that to fragile states 
over 2010-2012.

Despite these relatively small shares, the GPE’s 
influence increased over the decade, partly as 
a result of improved disbursement rates. The 
slow rates of disbursement had been one of 
the strongest criticisms of the GPE in the 2010 
midterm evaluation, severely compromising its 
effectiveness (Cambridge Education et al., 2010; 
UNESCO, 2010a).The World Bank, supervising 
a majority of GPE-administered funds, required 
eligible countries to apply full World Bank 
project procedures to their trust fund operations, 
including GPE grants. This was recognized as 
a shortcoming, and the number of supervising 
and managing entities has now been diversified, 
with the World Bank supervising 73% of active 
grants, down from 92% of closed programme 
implementation grant allocations (GPE, 2013a).

Reaching the countries most in need

The initial concept of the GPE, then called 
the EFA Fast Track Initiative, was to assist a 
small, select group of strong performers with 
additional funding. In 2003, after criticism, the 
GPE broadened its criteria to all low income 
countries and others eligible for World Bank

funds that had robust policies and credible 
plans. It was then pointed out that the countries 
with the least capacity to meet these criteria 
were the most likely to need support. In 2005, 
the EFA Fast Track Initiative Fragile States Task 
Team was established to consider how the GPE 
could increase support for education in fragile 
countries (Brannelly et al., 2009).

Since the midterm appraisal in 2010, the GPE’s 
priority focus has definitively shifted. Support to 
fragile states is one of its five main objectives. It 
engages with them through more flexible funding, 
revising the eligibility of supervising and managing 
entities, mobilizing external financing for them, 
providing up to 25% of indicative allocation 
amounts on an urgent basis, and working with 
humanitarian agencies to help bridge the gap 
between emergency response and education 
development activities (GPE, 2012c). By the end 
of 2013, more than 40% of GPE disbursements, 
over US$800 million, went to fragile and conflict-
affected countries (GPE, 2013b).13

In terms of resource allocation to the countries 
most in need, the GPE not only outperforms 
other donors now, but has also made the most 
progress over the decade. On average, over 
2010–2012, 81% of total GPE disbursements were 
to low income countries, compared with 42% for 
members of the OECD Development Assistance 
Committee. Similarly, it increased its share to 
fragile states from an average of 16% over 2004–
2006 to 35% over 2010–2012 (Figure 8.16). The 
GPE also now requires countries seeking support 
to provide education indicators on disadvantaged 
groups so that the poorest children are identified 
and targeted (Australian Aid, 2012). As of 2014, 
30 GPE grants have components related to 
supporting children with disabilities; in some 
cases, this has helped countries leverage support 
from other partners for mainstreaming and 
inclusion of children with disabilities (Global 
Partnership for Education, 2014d).

The GPE commitment to EFA goals outside  
primary education remains poor. 

In the GPE’s 2004 framework, one of its four 
objectives was strengthened: more efficient 
provision of aid for primary education (FTI 
Secretariat, 2004). The initiative was conceived 

13. It should be noted that the GPE’s definition of fragile and conflict-affected 
states differs from that of the GMR.

271

FINANCEprimarily to achieve universal primary 
completion, not the broader set of EFA goals set 
out in Dakar. The 2010 midterm evaluation noted 
that this narrow focus remained unchallenged 
(Cambridge Education et al., 2010).

Gender was neglected. A 2005 review by the 
United Nations Girls’ Education Initiative was 
critical of the GPE’s endorsement of country 
plans that paid little attention to gender other 
than increasing enrolment of girls in school 
(Unterhalter, 2007). Just four of the endorsed 
plans included the concept of gender equality. 
At the end of 2005, however, the GPE made an 
explicit commitment ‘to gender’, saying the 
issue would not ‘be sidelined’, and pledging 
to closely monitor whether country plans 
integrated gender-related issues (Oxfam, 2007). 
One of the five main elements of the GPE’s 
2012–2015 strategy is ensuring that all girls in 
GPE-endorsed countries successfully complete 
primary school in a safe learning environment 
(GPE, 2012c).

A more recent review indicates a slow but 
shifting trend in the use of funds. The number 
of grants with interventions to improve the 
quality of education has doubled, although in 
volume terms there has been little change. 
Large increases in funding for ECCE and literacy 
translated to ninefold and tenfold rises in 
volume, respectively, but the total shares of all 
GPE grants for these areas remain comparatively 
small at 1.9% and 1.0%, respectively 
(GPE, 2013a).

In 2011, 60 pledges were made by recipient 
governments, international donors and the 
private sector at the first GPE Replenishment 
Conference; at the second conference in 2014, 85 
were made. Between 2015 and 2018, additional 
commitments of US$28.5 billion are pledged 
by governments, donors and the private sector. 
Pledges in 2014 of US$26 billion by recipient 
governments represented a 25% increase in 
domestic finance for education over 2015–18 
when compared to pledges made in 2011 at the 
first conference (GPE, 2014b).14 However, it is 
not clear whether the resources pledged can 
be counted as additional to intended domestic 

14. A direct comparison cannot be made between the replenishment rounds 
of 2011 and 2014 because different countries were involved in each.

education financing; any post-2015 framework 
would need to monitor this closely.

General budget support can contribute to 
education funding

In aid-dependent countries, general budget 
support has provided a substantial increase 
in the resources available for development 
spending and basic service delivery. In Rwanda, 
total general budget support from all donors 
funded 14% of the national budget in the 
financial year 2010/11. In the United Republic 
of Tanzania, the share was 8%, down from 
20% in 2003/04 (ICAI, 2012c). Expenditure on 
primary development programmes in the United 
Republic of Tanzania increased significantly, 
from 27% of the budget in 2004/05 to 46% 
in 2008/09, enabling dramatic expansion in 
provision of education, health, water and 
sanitation, infrastructure, and agriculture (ICAI, 
2012c). Positive findings regarding general 
budget support are corroborated by findings 
that recipient governments were twice as likely 
to report improved access to services compared 
to countries that did not receive such support 
(National Audit Office, 2008). In many cases, 
however, donors are reducing their support of 
country budgets through the use of general 
budget support. Bilateral donors reduced 
average disbursements to general budget 
support from US$3.2 billion in 2007–2009, when 
levels peaked, to US$2.1 billion in 2010–2012 
(OECD-DAC, 2014).

Sector-wide approaches in education have had 
mixed success

Sector-wide approaches (SWAps) involve funds 
donated not to self-contained projects but to a 
defined sector policy that is led by a government 
authority in partnership with external partners. 
The Dakar Framework called for donors to 
‘co-ordinate their efforts to provide flexible 
development assistance within the framework 
of sectorwide reforms and support sector 
priorities’, and to ‘make longer-term and more 
predictable commitments’. This was a change 
from the project-oriented approach to aid, where 
hundreds of individual projects put great strain 
on recipient countries’ limited economic and 
human resources.

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 81025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportInternational development assistance

In 1996 in Uganda, there were 147 separate 
donor projects in the education sector, with 
45 donor missions from over 30 donors. After 
the implementation of an education SWAp in 
2002, the number of projects fell to seven and 
donor missions to two (Boak and Ndaruhutse, 
2011). SWAps have to date been implemented 
in 25 low income countries; 5 of the SWAps 
are subsectoral, focusing on primary and 
basic education. Some evidence of success 
includes efficiency and cost savings due to 
better coordination and flexibility. In Uganda, 
a more competitive tendering process for 
learning materials meant a 60% reduction in 
the unit costs of primary textbooks (Boak and 
Ndaruhutse, 2011).

However, the effectiveness of education 
SWAps can be limited, as they largely exclude 
stakeholders other than government and donors. 
non-government organizations (NGOs), for 
instance, are not involved in these approaches. 
And yet, as the case of Bangladesh illustrates, 
such groups are important providers of 
services in underserved sectors. The former 
Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee, 
now known simply as BRAC, is the largest 
provider of education services after the 
government, running 40,000 non-formal schools 
in areas where government provision is poor 

(Asadullah and Chaudhur, 2008). Also, some 
donors’ unwillingness or inability to disburse 
contributions through SWAps means that high 
transaction costs continue for many recipient 
governments, despite a SWAp arrangement in 
place (Boak and Ndaruhutse, 2011); some end 
up delivering parallel aid in project form. In 2012, 
just 7% of total aid for education was delivered 
in the form of sector-wide budget support 
(OECD-DAC, 2014).

Education aid does not always reach 
recipient countries

Less aid is spent in-country in the education 
sector than aid that is earmarked for other 
sectors, mainly because of support to students 
studying at donor country universities. 
Scholarships account for one-quarter of direct 
aid to education. Country programmable aid,15 
that is, aid that reaches recipient countries, 
made up 68% of total aid disbursements to 
the education sector, compared with 86% in 
health and agriculture and 93% in the water and 
sanitation sector in 2012 (Figure 8.17).

Aid is focusing more on results

Since Dakar, demand has increased for 
information on the outcomes of aid, not just

approach, strengthening the link between aid 
intervention and results, involves agreements 
between donor and recipient to release aid 
upon the achievement of measurable targets. 
Although this is a relatively new way to disburse 
aid, it amounted to more than US$5 billion 
in 2010 (Pereira and Villota, 2012), including 
through models such as cash-on-delivery. The 
United Kingdom’s partnership with Ethiopia in 
2012 was the first to introduce a pilot cash-on-
delivery aid approach in the education sector. In 
Rwanda, the United Kingdom allotted 10% of its 
education support in the form of results-based 
aid, beginning in 2013 for an initial period of 
three years (ICAI, 2012a).

It is too early to evaluate the approach’s 
effectiveness. However, a key danger is that 
donors put their own aims ahead of the needs 
of beneficiary countries so as to make progress 
towards time-bound targets. Investment in the 
education sector, unlike other sectors, cannot 
be translated into immediate results in a short 
period. Donors are not focusing on areas of 
education that have proven benefits; for example, 
almost no aid was disbursed to ECCE and female 
literacy over the past decade (Fredriksen, 2012).

Aid strategies need to expand beyond 
achieving access

The most tangible outcome of education aid 
has been expanded enrolment, especially in 
basic education. An increase in aid to education 
equivalent to 1% of a recipient country’s 
GDP is associated with increases in primary 
completion of 1.6% per year and in the primary 
net enrolment ratio of between 2.5% and 5% 
(Michaelowa and Weber, 2007).

The impact of foreign aid on gender parity has 
been found to be minimal, perhaps because 
many countries have reached or are on their way 
to achieving gender parity in primary education 
(Maiga, 2014). Girls face larger obstacles in 
entering primary schooling than boys do, but once 
in school they have an equal chance of completing 
(UNESCO, 2012b). While donor education policies 
often address gender inequity in terms of access 
and retention, the less easily measurable issue of 
gender equality is usually not mentioned (Mercer, 
2014). Moreover, the more challenging factors 
that keep girls from entering school in the first 

place – such as poverty-related issues, distance 
to school, the opportunity cost of girls’ schooling, 
and cultural beliefs – could be addressed by more 
effective donor aid (Maiga, 2014).

More effective aid could also help in achieving 
the sixth EFA goal, improving the quality of 
education. A review of DFID aid to education 
in three East African countries noted that it 
had largely failed to address learning-related 
issues. However, DFID’s education programme 
in India has a target of a 2% increase in the 
proportion of children who, after two years of 
primary school, have sufficient fluency to read 
to learn (ICAI, 2012b). To address the poor 
progress towards goal 6, donor strategies are 
beginning to look beyond education access and 
emphasize the importance of quality, including 
through considerable investment in regional 
and international achievement assessments 
(Riddell, 2012).

The role of humanitarian aid to the 
education sector

A common perception of humanitarian aid is 
that it is used in the short term to address crises 
that end. Evidence says otherwise: a majority 
of international humanitarian assistance goes 
to long-term recipient countries. In 2012, 
66% of humanitarian assistance from OECD 
donors went to countries that had received 
above-average shares of aid in the form of 
humanitarian assistance for eight or more years 
(Development Initiatives, 2014).

With protracted emergencies occurring more 
frequently, the education sector in the past 
decade has tried to convince the humanitarian 
aid sector that investment in education is life-
saving. The Dakar Framework hoped the world 
could ‘meet the needs of education systems 
affected by conflict, natural calamities and 
instability and conduct educational programmes 
in ways that promote mutual understanding, 
peace and tolerance, and that help to prevent 
violence and conflict’.

Definitions of aid to education in humanitarian 
situations continue to be narrow, however. The 
Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), a 
standby pooled funding mechanism intended to 
make money available for relief work as soon 
as the need arises, has particular criteria for 

Almost no aid

funding education, including provision of school 
tents, education and recreational materials, 
emergency repair of education facilities, teacher 
training in emergencies and provision of life-
saving skills (CERF, 2010). That education is 
perceived as life-saving in such narrow terms 
means it continues to be neglected within an 
already under-resourced humanitarian aid 
system (UNESCO, 2011b).

Humanitarian aid appeals still  
neglect education

In 2010, a resolution by the UN General 
Assembly called on member states to increase 
humanitarian funding to education and 
supporting diverse funding channels (United 
Nations, 2010). In 2012, recognizing the 
importance of the education sector as life-
saving, over 20 stakeholders – governments, 
UN agencies, the private sector and CSOs 
– called for doubling the percentage of total 
humanitarian aid earmarked for education to at 

least 4% of all funds from humanitarian appeals 
(United Nations, 2012).

Despite this, the sector has not come close to 
the target. In 2013, it received 2% of funds from 
humanitarian appeals (Figure 8.18). It continues 
to receive one of the smallest proportions of 
requests for humanitarian aid – 40% of what it 
requested in 2013, compared with 86% for the 
food sector and 57% for the health sector.

Moreover, while 4% was a useful target 
for advocacy, it falls short of the needs 
of all beneficiaries. In 2013, for instance, 
9 million beneficiaries16 were targeted for 
education programmes through the UN 
consolidated appeal process (CAP).17 The 
failure to fully fund the CAP requirements 
meant that only about 3 million beneficiaries 
received humanitarian funding. In addition, 
even if the donor community had allocated 
4% of humanitarian funding to education, 
some 19.5 million children would have

Cannot Wait, 2014).

Humanitarian aid must also go beyond the issue 
of allotment to ensure prioritization across 
emergencies. How can different crisis appeals 
be funded so countries are not left behind? 
In 2013 in South Sudan, three-quarters of the 
CAP total was funded, while in Djibouti the 
figure was one-third (Office for the Coordination 
of Humanitarian Affairs, 2014). High-impact 
crises that cause many fatalities in a short 
period tend to be much better funded than 
protracted emergencies. In all, 7 high-profile 
events18 have received 44% of humanitarian 
funding for education since Dakar, out of a 
total of 260 education appeals (Dolan, 2011).

Humanitarian aid is vital to help countries 
rebuild after crises

Some 36% of the world’s out-of-school 
children live in conflict-affected countries, up 
from 30% in 1999. Many of these countries 
are the furthest from achieving the EFA 
goals and need support from external donors 
to help ensure progress. Many conflict-
affected countries, together with fragile 
states, have been the subject of a years-
long CAP to raise resources for an effective 
humanitarian response.

In many cases, humanitarian aid makes up a 
large share of total resources channeled to 
such countries. In 2012, for the 21 countries 
in a CAP, humanitarian aid made up 23% 
of total resources.19 Total humanitarian aid 
for Somalia, where civil war has continued 
for more than two decades, amounted to 
over 60% of external resources.20 However, it 
represented 27% of total external financing 
for the education sector; for all 21 countries, 
humanitarian aid to education accounted for 
8% of total external resources (Figure 8.19).

Humanitarian funding for education in conflict-
affected countries in 2012 was US$105 million, 
much less significant than the US$1.1 billion

difference demonstrates the lack of prioritization

particularly problematic in countries that receive 
more humanitarian funding than development

decreased rapidly from US$136 million in 2008 
to US$40 million in 2012 (OECD-DAC, 2014), yet 
since conflict began in 2010 the education sector 
has been one of the most poorly funded through

up for the reduction in development funding. 
Furthermore, humanitarian and development 
aid have different governance structures, which 
must collaborate to address the education 
sector’s disadvantage.

Pooled funding has had an impact in fragile 
states but needs to be scaled up

A variety of mechanisms are open to donors 
to fund education in fragile states, such as 
development (recovery) funding, humanitarian 
appeals and multidonor trust funds. But 
the Inter-Agency Network for Education in 
Emergency recommends pooled funding 
for education in fragile states to reduce 
transaction costs and increase coordination and 
harmonization. Two years after the conflict in 
Sierra Leone ended, a multidonor pool provided 
general budget support for ten years, disbursing 
GBP 10 million a year. This was crucial in 
supporting recurrent expenditure as well as 
complementing efforts in building governance. 
Higher spending in MDG-related areas had a 
direct impact on service delivery in the education 
sector (Manuel et al., 2012).

Three types of pooled funding mechanisms are 
used in the disbursement of humanitarian aid: 
CERF, Common Humanitarian Funds (CHFs) 
and Emergency Response Funds (ERFs). CERF 
covers all countries affected by an emergency. 
CHFs and ERFs are country-specific and provide 
country-based pooled and predictable funding 
for implementing agencies on the ground.

Despite a recommendation to scale up 
pooled funding mechanisms, the volume of 
humanitarian aid for education flowing through 
CERF, ERFs and CHFs has not changed since 
2010. In volume terms, CHFs typically make 
up the bulk of humanitarian aid resources for 
education from pooled funding mechanisms. The 
standby funding from CERF amounts to a very 
small share of funding to education, averaging 
1.37% between 2006 and 2014 (United Nations, 
2014c). The share of total humanitarian funding 
for the education sector disbursed through the 
three mechanisms rose steeply in proportionate 
terms from 2010 to 2012 – from 6.7% to 22.1% 
– then fell, declining to 11.7% by 2013 (Office for 
the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 2014).

NGOs appear to disburse resources  
better to neglected EFA goals

The Dakar Framework stated: ‘Partnerships 
between governments, NGOs, communities and 
families can help ensure the provision of good 
care and education for children, especially for 
those most disadvantaged’. This has proved true, 
as the role of NGO funding of formal education 
has grown. Until the 1990s, very few NGOs 
from the Global North were involved, believing 
that provision of basic education should be 
the responsibility of governments. Non-state 
provision was ushered in during widespread 
structural adjustment programmes and the 
accompanying privatization and austerity. 
From the 2000s, government and civil society 
emphasized social progress, not just economic 
progress, a shift that encouraged involvement 
of NGOs, with their people-centred, grass-roots 
approaches (Banks and Hulme, 2012). While 
comprehensive data are lacking, it is estimated 
that NGO funding to education totals between 
US$2.6 billion and US$5.2 billion (Naylor and 
Ndaruhutse, 2014).

NGOs have become important providers of basic 
services in some countries. They play a vital 
role in providing education for the hardest to 
reach, especially where state provision is absent 
or of poor quality. In Bangladesh, which had 
no early childhood development strategy as of 
December 2011, the number of children in BRAC 
pre-schools is estimated to roughly equal that 
in programmes run by the Ministry of Women 
and Children Affairs (Dundar et al., 2014). In the 
arid and semi-arid lands of Kenya, NGOs are 
more visible than the government in providing 
goods and services, including education (Brass, 
2012). In Somalia, the absence of an effective 
government apparatus means donors often 
channel aid resources through NGOs. Moreover, 
NGOs are more active in neglected EFA areas.

NGOs’ spending on education indicates their 
objectives are in alignment with EFA goals 
traditionally neglected by governments and 
donors, such as non-formal education and 
ECCE. In 2012, Plan International spent a

FINANCEmajority of its education funding (out of four 
subsectors) on ECCE. A large part of its 2010–
2013 education strategy focuses on access, 
quality and governance, and is well aligned 
with EFA goals (Naylor and Ndaruhutse, 2014). 
BRAC targets school dropouts and other 
out-of-school children with support intended 
as a route back into formal education for 
disadvantaged children. Overall expenditure on 
BRAC’s education programme in Bangladesh 
is around US$50 million a year. Since 2002, 
BRAC has expanded internationally: it now has 
programmes in 11 developing countries, of 
which 7 have education components (Naylor and 
Ndaruhutse, 2014).

NGO funding of education can be problematic, 
however. Sustainability may be a challenge, 
with increased reliance by many NGOs on 
international aid agencies for funding. Moreover, 
NGO service provision may absolve governments 
of their responsibility to provide education, 
especially in the non-formal sector. ActionAid 
found that, over many years, government 
investment in education appeared to decline 
in geographical areas where it ran non-formal 
education centres; moreover, governments 
were reluctant to take on the cost of running 
these NGO centres partly due to their lack 
of compliance with government regulations 
(Rose, 2010). Another issue is the difficulty 
of tracking NGO spending at country level. In 
2012, US$1.2 billion, or 11%, of direct aid to 
education was channelled through NGOs (OECD-
DAC, 2014), but many recipient governments 
cannot track these resources on the ground, 
making it difficult to assess the total volume 
of aid disbursed to the education sector. A few 
international NGOs have started reporting to 
the International Aid Transparency Initiative, a 
voluntary multistakeholder effort to improve the 
transparency of aid resources so as to increase 
aid effectiveness (IATI, n.d.).

Non-traditional financing could be  
more important in coming years

Non-traditional financing is a concept originating 
at the Monterrey Conference on Financing for 
Development in 2002. Defined as ‘new or novel 
ways to generate predictable, additional and 
sustainable financing’ (Bellinger and Fletcher, 
2014), it has grown exponentially, to more 
than US$50 billion (Burnett and Bermingham, 
2010). In 2010, the Leading Group on Innovative 

Financing for Development established a task 
force on education. It recommended nine 
mechanisms to broaden funding of the education 
sector: a financial transaction tax, local currency 
education bonds, venture funds, diaspora bonds, 
voluntary contributions from migrants, debt 
swaps, sport levies, public–private partnerships 
and micro-donations from individual bank 
transactions. Similar mechanisms in the health 
sector have generated over US$7 billion in 
funding since their inception in 2002 (Innovative 
Finance Foundation, 2013).

Few of these innovative mechanisms have 
been applied in the education sector. Yet there 
are many reasons why advocates see their 
potential (Bellinger and Fletcher, 2014). Social 
and development impact bonds, for instance, 
leverage funds from the private sector for 
under-resourced development areas, including 
education. The first development impact 
bond in education, launched in Rajasthan, 
India (Box 8.2), is a possible model for 
catalysing additional resources for post-2015 
education goals.

Box 8.2: Development impact bonds 
in education

In June 2014, the UBS Optimus Foundation, the Children’s 
Investment Fund Foundation, Educate Girls and Instiglio 
launched the first development impact bond in education. 
Its aim is improving educational outcomes in Rajasthan, 
India. A three-year pilot, it intends to address high 
dropout rates and poor learning outcomes with an upfront 
investment by UBS of US$238,000 being channelled 
through Educate Girls, an NGO working in public primary 
schools to address the twin challenges of retention and 
quality learning.

Educate Girls has set targets for assessing progress, 
including improved results in 3 subject areas in 150 of the 
poorest-performing schools in Rajasthan. If it succeeds, 
the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation will pay the 
investors back, at a rate of return of around 7% to 13%, 
depending on the success rate.

The potential for development or social impact bonds 
within the education sector is high, judging by the 
positive returns demonstrated in the health sector.

PART 1: MONITORING THE PROGRESS TOWARDS EDUCATION FOR ALLCHAPTER 81025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportDiagnostic tools needed to 
assess education financing

Effective advocacy for more finance for 
education and more efficient use of resources 
requires comprehensive data and the diagnostic 
tools to gather and analyse that data. Such 
tools help governments and donors make 
the best use of finite resources and, in the 
complex world of education, understand how 
much various stakeholders are disbursing, 
where and to whom.

Since Dakar, a few useful tools have been 
established and scaled up. National Education 
Accounts (NEAs) have been piloted in a few 
countries. In Nigeria, a USAID-administered NEA 
for four states revealed that 42% of education 
financing was from private sources in Bauchi 
state. This led to the education budget being 
increased from 17% to 26% of the total budget 
(Oleksy-Ojikutu and Forbes, 2013). In the health 
sector, National Health Accounts (NHAs) have 
had broader reach (more than 190 countries) 
and more success. Once apartheid ended in 
South Africa, an NHA redistributed health funds 
and infrastructure after public health spending 
was found to be 3.6 times higher in wealthy areas 
than in poor ones (Van Der Gaag and Abetti, 2011).

Other diagnostic tools have helped illustrate 
changes in volume, efficiency and equity of public 
resources for education; examples are public 
expenditure reviews and public expenditure 
tracking surveys. Pre-dating Dakar, and largely 
donor-led thus far, they have increased in 
frequency and geographical coverage in the 
past 15 years. Reviews of public expenditure 
answer many questions regarding government 
expenditure, including how much, on what and 
on whom public education funds are spent (World 
Bank, 2009). The usefulness of public expenditure 
tracking surveys lies in their ability to identify 
gaps between intended expenditure and what 
actually reaches recipients (World Bank, 2009). 
GPE-funded country status reports provide the 
most comprehensive analyses of the education 
sector and its financing and efficiency. So far 
undertaken only in sub-Saharan Africa, they have 
proved to mobilize financial resources effectively 
and build consensus for policy reform. Benefit 
incidence analysis should be scaled up to identify 
inequity and improve data availability, regularity 
and timeliness.

Conclusion

Institutional use of such tools relies on intense 
data collection, including regular, comprehensive 
information on financing sources and recipients. 
Challenges include collecting comparable 
information from different types of schools, public 
and private, and from all levels of government, 
local, state and national. Cost is also an issue: 
piloting an NEA can require between US$0.5 and 
US$1.5 million (Van Der Gaag and Abetti, 2011). 
Nevertheless, any post-2015 framework on 
monitoring education finance will increasingly rely 
on such tools to track progress against the issues 
raised in this chapter.

Conclusion

The pledge made at Dakar that no country should 
be thwarted in achieving the EFA goals due to lack 
of resources has been one of the biggest failures 
of the EFA period. Donors failed to live up to their 
promises. Resources were increased to meet the 
goal of universal free primary education, but are 
still in chronic shortage: more is needed to ensure 
that the goal of universal primary education is met. 
The efforts of many low income governments in 
reprioritizing education budgets towards primary 
education are commendable, but more is required 
to prioritize education spending in general. 
Financial support from governments and donors 
for the other EFA goals has been negligible and 
progress towards them weak. There is still a need 
to reprioritize resources from non-EFA education 
areas, such as tertiary education, towards 
areas which would benefit the disadvantaged. 
Households have had to bolster spending to make 
up for a lack of national resources.

Aid to education as a share of total aid has 
stayed stagnant, and within education aid, the 
share of basic education has changed very little. 
Moreover, aid to basic education has failed to 
be reprioritised to the countries most in need. 
These mistakes need to be avoided for any 
set of goals for education after 2015. A firm 
financial commitment to education is demanded 
of governments, donors and other education 
funders, and civil society must hold them to 
account. Otherwise, those who will pay the price, 
as has been the case since Dakar, are the children 
in need of basic education, the marginalized and 
the hard to reach. More broadly, all of society 
will miss out on the long-term, wide-ranging, 
transformative effects of education.

The Dakar 
pledge that no 
country should 
be thwarted in 
achieving the 
EFA goals due to 
lack of resources 
has been one 
of the biggest 
failures of the

Highlights ■The post-2015 education goal and targets more closely reflect the holistic vision of the Education for All movement, recognising that all levels of education are interrelated. ■Several of the proposed new education targets lack specificity and clarity in how they are defined and in the outcomes expected. This may undermine the ability to reach the targets by 2030. ■To achieve the equity orientation of the new agenda, countries will need to improve their targeting of policies and resources and adapt inequality indicators to their respective national context. ■The new target for all countries to attain universal upper secondary education by 2030 is unrealistic – projections for this report suggest that this target will not be achieved this century on current trends. ■National resources will not be sufficient to meet the basic education targets by 2030. The total external financing gap is projected to average US$22 billion annually between 2015 and 2030. Almost half of this, or US$10.6 billion pertains to low income countries. ■Projections indicate that aid to education will stagnate over the next few years. To achieve basic education targets by 2030, the level of external assistance to low and lower middle income countries would need to increase by at least four times.1025Post-2015 education goal and

It includes a new cost projection

education goals which may be the 
most important factor underlying the 
new agenda’s success or failure.

For more than a decade, the UNESCO Education for All Global Monitoring Report has 
played a pivotal role in helping the world to monitor and track progress in achieving the 
right of every child, girls and boys, to a good quality education. As we head into the final 
year of the Millennium Development Goals and set the agenda for global education for the 
years ahead, this report tells us that while progress has been made, our work is far from 
done. We must - and we can - do better.”

PART 2: POST-20151025Education for All Global Monitoring Report  Chapter 9    Post-2015 education goal and targets:  

Status and prospects

Introduction

The Education for All (EFA) movement tackled 
ambitious challenges in the wake of the 
establishment of the Dakar Framework for 
Action in 2000. Some global progress has 
been achieved, and the pace of change has 
quickened. There have been notable failures, 
such as the fact that hundreds of millions of 
adults, especially women, are denied their 
right to literacy and numeracy. Other EFA 
targets suffered from a lack of clarity on their 
parameters or expected results. With a new 
post-2015 agenda to be established, how can 
the international education community achieve 
more, learning from the past?

The EFA Global Monitoring Report (GMR) has 
monitored progress on an almost annual basis 
towards the EFA goals, and the two education-
related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), 
since 2002. Looking towards the next agenda 
for education and development after the 2015 
deadline, it is instructive to use the lessons of 
the past 15 years to increase the likelihood of 
achievements over the next 15.

This chapter draws on the GMR experience 
to critically assess the proposed post-
2015 education targets and offer key 
recommendations. After providing an overview 
of post-2015 developments related to the global 
agenda for education, the chapter provides 
general criticisms of the current formulation of 
targets. To be used successfully, targets need to 
be specific, measurable, realistic and relevant. 
Equity issues must be clearly articulated to 
ensure that no one gets left behind. Using 
this assessment, specific points are raised for 
each of the ten education-related Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) targets.

The political context for the targets is as 
important as the targets themselves. This 
chapter examines how the SDGs can and must 
improve the international context for education 

development to support implementation of the 
new agenda. The chapter includes a new cost 
projection showing the significant increase in 
finance necessary to achieve SDG education 
goals. This may be the most important factor 
underlying the new agenda’s success or failure.

Overview of post-2015 
developments

At the 70th Session of the UN General Assembly 
in late September 2015, member states will 
adopt a new global development agenda with a 
set of SDGs at its core. The SDGs will establish 
development priorities, including for education, 
over the following 15 years. They will succeed 
both the MDGs and the EFA goals, both of 
which ran to 2015.

Much progress has been made on developing the 
SDGs since the UN Conference on Sustainable 
Development (Rio+20), which launched the 
process in 2012. Important milestones were 
reached in mid-2014, notably a set of proposed 
goals from the Open Working Group (OWG) 
on SDGs based on lengthy intergovernmental 
negotiations. The SDG process involved an 
unprecedented level of public consultation, 
including contributions from civil society 
organizations. Within the education sector, the 
Muscat Agreement of May 2014 – developed 
with member states, international organizations 
and representatives of civil society – constituted 
a concerted effort to influence the content 
of the SDG education goal and its targets 
(UNESCO, 2014c).

In December 2014, the United Nations 
Secretary-General put forward a Synthesis 
Report of major documents and processes 
relating to the post-2015 development agenda. It 
provides material for further intergovernmental 
negotiations taking place up to September 2015, 
when the precise SDG goals and targets will be

POST-2015 EDUCATION GOAL AND TARGETS: STATUS AND PROSPECTSIntroductionfinalized, together with the financial frameworks 
required to achieve the new agenda (United 
Nations, 2014b).

In May 2015, 15 years after the Dakar World 
Education Forum, the international community 
will reconvene at Incheon, Republic of Korea, 
and issue a statement on post-2015 education 
priorities, together with a framework for 
action, which is intended to contribute to 
the final formulation of the SDG education 
goal and targets.

The OWG has proposed seventeen SDGs, 
including one dedicated to education (Box 9.1), 
along with 169 targets. The proposals would 
considerably enlarge the objectives of the eight 
MDGs, which were strongly oriented towards 
poverty reduction in the Global South and the 
requisite mobilization of aid. Their application to 
high income countries was limited and they were 
not considered truly global.

By contrast, the proposed SDGs reflect a 
broadened global agenda addressing worldwide 
challenges that have emerged since 2000. 
These include threats due to climate change 
and environmental degradation, as well as 
economic and social disruption due to growing 
inequality. The proposed SDGs also aim at 
strengthening links among peace, effective 
governance and human rights in ways that would 
reduce the negative impact of armed conflict, 
crime, terrorism, persecution, corruption and 
impunity on individuals’ everyday lives. The 
SDG agenda reflects countries’ increased 
capacity to fund and implement their own 
development strategies, including in education, 
partly through new and innovative partnerships 
with civil society organizations, responsible 
businesses and effective local authorities (United 
Nations, 2014b).

The proposed SDGs seek to link development 
priorities to a comprehensive policy agenda in 
a way that creates synergy and establishes a 
more effective response to global challenges. 
Poverty, health, sanitation, energy, employment, 
economic growth and environmental protection 
are closely intertwined in this framework. The 
same is true of the education sector, which is 
strongly integrated into the SDG agenda. It is 
seen, with some justification, as having a positive 
impact on a wide range of outcomes, including 
income, employment, agricultural productivity,

The proposed education SDG and targets 
(Box 9.2) are considerably broader than the 
corresponding MDGs with their narrow focus 
on primary education completion and gender 
parity. The SDG targets more closely reflect 
the holistic vision of the EFA movement, which

interrelated. While the EFA goals sought to 
ensure equal access to good quality basic 
education, the proposed SDG targets are more 
oriented to outcomes. Moreover, they ambitiously 
shift the emphasis to higher levels of education, 
referring to universal secondary completion 
and equal access to tertiary education. They 
also aim at improvement in skills needed for 
decent jobs, including through entrepreneurship, 
and acquiring knowledge of sustainable 
development though education that prioritizes 
global citizenship, human rights, peace, cultural 
diversity and gender equality. Overall, the SDG 
education targets are more closely aligned with 
an explicit lifelong learning framework.

Where do the proposed 
education targets fall short?

The proposed SDG framework’s expanded global 
agenda for education is designed to be ambitious 
and transformative. Yet at this historic juncture, 
what would it mean for countries and the 
international community to adopt a set of targets 
for education that are unrealistic, overambitious 
or too costly? Also of concern is how to improve 
the clarity of education targets so coherent 
indicators can be identified to monitor progress 
at the local, national, regional and global 
levels and to help countries devise effective 
implementation strategies and decide how to 
allocate resources. 

The United Nations Secretary-General’s 
Synthesis Report on the post-2015 sustainable 
development agenda argued that ‘measurable 
targets and technically rigorous indicators’ are 
needed and called for each target to be ‘framed 
in language that is specific, measurable [and] 
achievable’. It was subsequently suggested, 
following intergovernmental negotiations on the 
post-2015 agenda, that ‘technical proofing’ of 
the targets be conducted, which would involve 
contributions by technical experts in addition 
to those of the UN system. This section briefly 
summarizes the GMR’s main criticisms of the 
proposed education targets and then presents a 
more detailed discussion of their shortcomings, 
as a contribution to the debate.

POST-2015 EDUCATION GOAL AND TARGETS: STATUS AND PROSPECTSWhere do the proposed education targets fall short?Targets need to be specific and clear

Several of the proposed SDG education targets 
lack specificity and clarity in the concepts 
employed and outcomes expected. Specificity 
also relates to prioritization. Where there 
are many objectives within a target but none 
taking precedence, the ability to prioritize and 
allocate resources, required to achieve any 
goal, is eroded. Making targets more specific 
simplifies the selection of indicators and 
matching of objectives with actions. Superfluous 
language and multiple objectives undermine 
the attainment of targets. For example, EFA 
goal 3, which hoped to ensure ‘equitable 
access to appropriate learning and life-skills 
programmes’, arguably had little traction 
because it did not clearly define the particular 
skills or forms of education involved.

Some targets are not measurable

If targets cannot be adequately measured now 
or in the foreseeable future, accountability is 
threatened. Indeed, the use of the term ‘targets’ 
implies that the SDG agenda emphasizes 
quantitative measurement. However, some 
targets refer to outcomes for which data are 
currently unavailable, or which at least are not 
conventionally viewed as quantifiable.

Targets relating to attitudes and values 
necessary to peaceful and sustainable societies 
can be measured using various surveys, 
including household surveys, with sufficient 
resources and clear definitions. Other targets 
present considerable challenges. The upgrading 
of education facilities to be ‘effective learning 
environments’, while laudable, would be a major 
challenge for measurement. The challenge to 
build ‘inclusive’ schools sidesteps the reality 
of contrasting notions of inclusivity. A global 
measurement of skills needed for ‘decent jobs’ 
is similarly difficult because of different types 
of skills, which vary by country, as does what is 
considered ‘decent’. The idea of ‘technical and 
vocational skills’ raises several measurement 
issues. These are often specific to occupations. 
Definitions of required skills might change with 
employer demand or technological innovation. It 
would be a logistical nightmare to try to measure 
whether carpenters, mechanics or computer 
technicians, for example, have adequate 

technical skills apart from the vocational 
qualifications achieved.

The importance of realistic and 
relevant targets

Targets that have little chance of being met in 
a 15 year time-frame are unlikely to receive 
political commitment, support and cooperation 
from governments, donors, non-government 
organizations and local communities. The more 
ambitious the proposed target, the more unlikely 
it is to be met. For example, ensuring universal 
upper secondary education in the next 15 
years is beyond the reach of most countries. At 
current rates of progress, even universal lower 
secondary completion is not projected to be 
reached in low and middle income countries until 
the latter half of the 21st century (see below).

Targets must also be relevant. A common 
criticism of the EFA goals, or at least of how they 
were quantified and monitored, was their lack 
of relevance to education challenges facing high 
income countries. The same cannot be said of 
the proposed SDG targets. Ensuring children 
and youth leave school with adequate learning 
outcomes, and providing youth and adults with 
the skills necessary for decent employment, are 
relevant to all countries, including high income 
ones. However, to be applicable to individual 
countries, targets should be formulated in a 
way that accounts for conditions facing youth 
from marginalized or vulnerable populations, 
and for the diversity of skills needed in 
differing economies.

Equity issues are not clearly articulated

The essence of the goal is the achievement 
of inclusive and equitable education of good 
quality. But the ambiguous language of some 
targets could lead to marginalized groups 
being left behind. The lack of reference to free 
and compulsory basic education – pre-primary, 
primary and lower secondary education – has 
worrying implications. The household cost of 
education is one of the most significant barriers 
to participation among children and youth from 
poor households. Some of the proposed targets 
promote forms or levels of education that 
especially benefit the most advantaged students, 
possibly leading to inequitable public spending. 
Moreover, while pre-primary education has

cannot be 
adequately 
measured, 
accountability 
is threatened

286

PART 2: POST-2015CHAPTER 91025Education for All Global Monitoring Reportbeen shown to have a strong positive impact on 
education and life outcomes for all children and 
especially those most disadvantaged (UNESCO, 
2012c), free and compulsory pre-primary 
education is not mentioned, while completion of 
upper secondary education is given high priority.

In some targets, the concept of equal access 
is either missing or inadequately defined. It 
could be interpreted as equal access by all 
children to good quality schools, regardless 
of parental income or family background: a 
commendable but highly ambitious objective. 
Or it could mean, more simply, equal access 
to any school. Regardless of definition, equal 
access does not necessarily lead to the more 
important aim of less inequality of outcomes. 
Disadvantaged groups could be left behind, while 
the most privileged could maintain or advance 
their relative position. Quantitative indicators 
for outcomes, particularly learning outcomes, 
for these groups are needed. It is also unclear 
whether the targets cover the most significant 
disadvantaged groups. Categories of vulnerability 
mentioned in the targets do not include poverty, 
even though the greatest inequality is between 
the richest and poorest households.

Critical issues need to be addressed in  
each education target

Drawing on these general points, there are 
specific issues on which each proposed 
education target falls short. The critical 
discussion below is offered as a starting point 
for a possible reformulation of targets if the 
intergovernmental negotiation offers such 
an opportunity.

Target 4.1. By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys 
complete free, equitable and quality primary 
and secondary education leading to relevant and 
effective learning outcomes

The first target seeks to ensure that all children 
complete secondary education and acquire 
relevant learning outcomes. Its weaknesses are 
of particular concern. The main problem is that 
it does not separate secondary education into 
its lower and upper levels. The achievement of 
universal upper secondary by all countries by 
2030 is unrealistic. Globally, the upper secondary 
gross enrolment ratio was 62% in 2012, but this 
figure conceals disparities among regions and 

countries: for example, the rate was 32% in 
sub-Saharan Africa. No country has ever gone 
from such levels to achieving universal upper 
secondary education within 15 years. If the target 
leads to prioritizing upper secondary education, 
which typically channels students into unequal 
tracks and programmes and is more costly per 
student, it would be to the detriment of the right 
to a full cycle of good quality basic education, 
including lower secondary education.

A still ambitious but more feasible target for a 
15 year time-frame is a basic education cycle: 
an international benchmark of at least 9 years1 
of free, equitable and compulsory primary 
and lower secondary education. Analysis of 
documents in the UNESCO Right to Education 
Database indicates broad intention among 
countries to make lower secondary education 
free: 94 of 107 low and middle income countries 
have already legislated free lower secondary 
education, 66 through constitutional guarantees 
and 28 through other legal measures. Beyond 
legal guarantees the notion of ‘free’ requires 
clarity with respect to explicit (and implicit) 
fees charged to parents for educational 
services provided.

Target 4.1 does not say that primary and 
secondary education should be compulsory. 
Adding this notion to primary and lower 
secondary education would help ensure 
equitable access and completion, and would 
reflect the current situation. As of 2012, almost 
all countries had passed laws requiring school 
attendance at the primary level, and all but 25 
had done so for lower secondary education.

Target 4.2. By 2030 ensure that all girls and 
boys have access to quality early childhood 
development, care and pre-primary education so 
that they are ready for primary education

This target emphasizes universal access to 
good quality early childhood development (ECD) 
and pre-primary education programmes and 
assumes that such access can be equated with 
school readiness for all children. Given the high 
percentage of malnourished children worldwide 
and the estimate that 100 million children will 
still suffer from the effects of stunting in 2025, 
this assumption is problematic. Ensuring access

287

POST-2015 EDUCATION GOAL AND TARGETS: STATUS AND PROSPECTSWhere do the proposed education targets fall short?to ECD would not necessarily address the 
complex dietary and health challenges faced by 
tens of millions of children.

The global gross enrolment ratio for early 
childhood education was 54% in 2012, 
but there is disparity among regions and 
countries: for example, the ratio was 20% 
in sub-Saharan Africa. One year of free and 
compulsory pre-primary education would help 
to close the gaps in participation, especially 
among children from poor households and 
marginalized communities.

Country definitions of the purposes, duration 
and quality of ECD and pre-primary programmes 
vary significantly. So do policies governing 
the minimum qualifications of caretakers and 
teachers, the maximum number of children 
per qualified educator, and the extent to 
which caregivers possess expert knowledge 
about child development. The current target 
emphasizes access to ‘quality’ ECD or pre-
primary programmes, even though there is less 
international consensus over what good quality 
programmes at this level actually entail and how 
they can be compared across countries.

Target 4.3. By 2030 ensure equal access for 
all women and men to affordable quality 
technical, vocational and tertiary education, 
including university

This target sets a highly unrealistic agenda. If 
universal upper secondary education by 2030 is 
beyond reach, access for all to tertiary education 
is even more so. The global participation rate in 
tertiary education was 32% in 2012; the rate in 
sub-Saharan Africa was only 8%. In the unlikely 
scenario universal secondary education were 
achieved by 2030, it would take several more 
years to achieve equal access for all in tertiary 
education. Moreover, since many countries 
provide technical and vocational education at the 
secondary level or in both secondary and tertiary 
education, measuring and monitoring equal 
access to such programmes would be difficult. 

At the same time, the target could be more 
specific, more equitable and, ultimately, more 
ambitious. A target of this type that could be 
monitored would focus on opportunities available 
to all qualified learners who wish to pursue 
studies at the tertiary level (whether universities 

or technical and vocational programmes), with a 
focus on equity and non-discrimination.

The idea of ‘affordable’ tertiary education lacks 
clarity in both global and national terms. In many 
countries, much tertiary education is non-public, 
typically entailing higher costs to students or 
their families. How would the international 
community determine in real terms whether 
technical, vocational and tertiary education are 
more or less affordable?

The notion of adult learning and education is 
missing, but is fundamental to any lifelong 
learning framework, was included in the EFA 
framework, and should be included in this 
target. Without it, the proposed target is less 
ambitious and transformative than existing 
international agreements. 

Unlike other education targets, this one focuses 
on access only and does not specify desired 
outcomes. One of its possible outcomes, 
skill acquisition, is spelled out in target 4.4. 
Combining the two would address this weakness 
and reduce the number of targets to be achieved.

Target 4.4. By 2030, increase by x% the number of 
youth and adults who have relevant skills, including 
technical and vocational skills, for employment, 
decent jobs and entrepreneurship.

This outcome-oriented target focuses on 
improving the acquisition of work-related 
skills among some percentage of youth and 
adults. It is difficult to gauge how ambitious 
and transformative this target is. The precise 
extent to which youth and adults currently 
possess relevant work skills is unknown. For 
example, the fact that unemployment rates are 
high in some countries does not necessarily 
reflect the skill levels of their workers. A more 
ambitious target would be to ensure that all 
youth and adults possess a measurable set of 
defined skills.

In theory, the target could cover a wide range 
of skills, knowledge and competencies: 
foundation skills such as literacy and numeracy; 
transferable skills such as problem-solving, 
creative and critical thinking, effective 
communication of ideas, and ‘grit’ and 
determination; and more specific technical, 
practical or technological skills related to a 

The notion of 
adult learning 
and education 
is missing

288

PART 2: POST-2015CHAPTER 91025Education for All Global Monitoring Reportparticular job or occupation. ‘Relevant’ skills 
need to be more clearly defined. One possible 
focus could be on particular types of skills, such 
as digital or ICT, that are high in demand in the 
global economy.

In practice, literacy and numeracy are the only 
skills currently measured (and captured in 
target 4.6), mainly in high and middle income 
countries. Both are relevant to work and life; 
yet measurement strategies of each skill would 
likely vary depending on whether the focus 
was on employment or lifelong learning. It is 
particularly challenging to identify concrete 
indicators that capture relevant skills for 
employment, decent jobs and entrepreneurship, 
and that can be compared across countries.

The target’s current formulation is vague about 
routes to skill acquisition, whether formal 
schooling, non-formal programmes or informal 
learning. Such information is important in 
developing, implementing and measuring policy 
at the country level. A more specific formulation 
would look at the proportion of learners who 
acquire skills in different education contexts.

Target 4.5. By 2030, eliminate gender disparities 
in education and ensure equal access to all 
levels of education and vocational training 
for the vulnerable, including persons with 
disabilities, indigenous peoples, and children in 
vulnerable situations

This target is meant to underscore the 
paramount importance of equity in education. 
Is it better to have a stand-alone target such 
as this that focuses on equity and gender? Or 
would it be more effective to include explicit 
reference to equity and gender in each target? 
This issue is relevant for other SDGs, not only 
the education goal. Whatever decision is made, 
it is critical to apply disaggregated equity-
oriented indicators across all targets so that 
equity issues are comprehensively acknowledged 
and consistently addressed. Moreover, equity 
considerations should go beyond ensuring the 
most disadvantaged meet a minimum or loosely 
defined criteria of ‘equal access’, and should to 
some extent include equality of outcomes. 

This target only refers to gender disparities 
and makes no reference to gender inequalities 
in education. Some argue that stipulating a 

separate gender equality goal (SDG 5), separate 
from the education one, would detract from the 
monitoring of gender inequalities in education. 

There seems little justification for the current 
selection of vulnerable groups in the target, 
which should be expanded. The notion of 
vulnerability could include, for example,  
children in conflict zones, children residing 
in poor households, those living in sparsely 
populated regions, street children, children 
in migrant families, those belonging to 
indigenous or nomadic groups, language 
minorities and so on. 

Target 4.6. By 2030 ensure that all youth and at 
least x% of adults, both men and women, achieve 
literacy and numeracy

The basic right of all adults to literacy 
and numeracy is implicit in the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights, which refers to 
the ‘fundamental’ stage of education. Given the 
ambition of the SDG agenda, and the difficulty 
in setting global benchmarks, this target 
should aim for all adults to achieve literacy 
and numeracy by 2030 to be in line with these 
earlier commitments.

Equally important is the acknowledgement 
of literacy as a multidimensional skill, not a 
dichotomy, one that exists on a continuum. 
Thus, the target should be enhanced by explicitly 
basing it on a notion of functional literacy and 
numeracy in terms of a minimum proficiency 
level needed for active participation in the 
community. This would ensure that the target 
deals with basic skills and competences that 
transform lives.

Target 4.7. By 2030 ensure all learners acquire 
knowledge and skills needed to promote 
sustainable development, including among others 
through education for sustainable development 
and sustainable lifestyles, human rights, gender 
equality, promotion of a culture of peace and non-
violence, global citizenship, and appreciation of 
cultural diversity and of culture’s contribution to 
sustainable development

This target can be evaluated in at least two 
ways. On the one hand, its explicit link to 
sustainable development is strong, capturing 
the transformative aspirations of the broad

equality of 
outcomes to

POST-2015 EDUCATION GOAL AND TARGETS: STATUS AND PROSPECTSWhere do the proposed education targets fall short?post-2015 development agenda. Many, if not all, 
of the notions listed as promoting sustainable 
development are deeply embedded in principles 
established in existing international frameworks 
and conventions.2 The target is outcome oriented 
and universally applicable. More than other 
targets, it touches on the social, humanistic and 
moral purposes of education. Indeed, if adopted, 
this target will be one of the few international 
objectives to acknowledge the role of culture and 
the cultural dimensions of education.

On the other hand, the current formulation 
reflects the interests of many organizations 
and institutions. Concepts need to be clarified, 
as several of them overlap. Clarity is also 
necessary to construct a limited set of valid 
and measurable indicators. Considerable work 
would be needed to develop qualitative indicators 
sensitive to diverse country contexts. The target 
would also need to specify the education levels 
and/or age groups to which its concepts apply.

Means of implementation 4.a. Build and upgrade 
education facilities that are child, disability and 
gender sensitive and provide safe, non-violent, 
inclusive and effective learning environments for all

This is an important target that addresses the 
lack of adequate physical infrastructure in many 
education systems, as well as the need for safe 
and inclusive environments that nurture learning 
for all children, regardless of background and 
disability status. It is universally applicable and 
highlights dimensions of education apart from 
learning outcomes. Conceptions of safe and 
inclusive learning environments can be found, 
for example, in the INEE Minimum Standards 
and UNICEF’s Child-Friendly School Checklist.

specific, relevant and measurable, it is much

less clear how schools would become ‘effective’ 
learning environments and the extent to which 
this involves reforms to curricula, instructional 
materials, pedagogy and school governance. 

Means of implementation 4.b. By 2020 expand 
by x% globally the number of scholarships for 
developing countries in particular LDCs, SIDS and 
African countries to enrol in higher education, 
including vocational training, ICT, technical, 
engineering and scientific programmes in 
developed countries and other developing countries

It is questionable whether such a target, aimed 
at a specific group of countries, should be 
included in a universal development agenda. 
While it aims to reduce inequity among 
countries, it could exacerbate inequity within 
them by primarily benefiting those from the most 
privileged and politically connected backgrounds. 
There is little evidence that scholarships 
build knowledge and teaching capacity within 
beneficiary countries; often they are used as 
a means to see aid allocations return to the 
donor country.

The target assumes that student mobility 
is among the best means to increase the 
formation of expert human capital in resource-
constrained education systems. However, 
while data on cross-national higher education 
scholarships are available, there is a lack of 
information on the benefits, such as outcomes 
of scholarships and whether students return to 
their home countries. Data are also lacking on 
the national origins of students in technical or 
engineering programmes.

With its focus on traditional scholarships, 
the target may already be out of date, given 
the transformation under way in access to

expansion of e-learning, distance and online 
courses (such as massive open online 
courses, or MOOCs) and cross-border forms of 
higher education.

Finally, it is remarkable that there is no 
overall finance target, or at least a financing 
equity target that would track how domestic 
and external financing is used to serve the 
disadvantaged in all countries.

Means of implementation 4.c. By 2030 increase 
by x% the supply of qualified teachers, including 
through international cooperation for teacher 
training in developing countries, especially 
LDCs and SIDS

Progress towards the post-2015 education SDG 
will be stymied if the quality and effectiveness of 
teaching are not front and centre in the main list 
of targets. Teaching may be considered a ‘means 
of implementation’, but comparing teachers 
to improved infrastructure and increased 
scholarships ignores, and weakens, the critical 
role teachers play in the learning and maturation 
processes of children and youth. The current 
formulation of the target narrowly focuses 
on challenges facing low and middle income 
countries, where the quantitative gap in the 
supply is well documented (UNESCO, 2014c). But 
the need for a sufficient supply of qualified and 
trained teachers and ways to ensure effective 
teaching are paramount in all countries.

A more ambitious target should focus on 
the instructional needs of all learners. To 
be more transformational, the target should 
underscore the need to ensure quality 
teaching for all by describing teachers who 
are professionally trained, motivated (through 
adequate remuneration, working conditions and 
recognition), well-supported (through in-service 
training) and deployed where required.

Lessons for implementing  
the new agenda

The proposed SDG targets in education will 
be discussed at the World Education Forum in 
Incheon in May 2015, when representatives of 
the international education community convene 

to take stock of what has been achieved since 
Dakar. In September 2015 the international 
community will adopt a new development 
agenda, including an education goal and targets, 
during the United Nations General Assembly. 
Whatever precise formulation is eventually 
agreed in New York, and regardless of the 
role the World Education Forum may play, 
the final language of the post-2015 education 
targets is unlikely to be less ambitious than the 
current proposals. 

Analysis of projections for low and middle 
income countries for this GMR suggests that 
the world will likely remain far from key targets 
if recent trends continue. For example, these 
countries will still be distant from the proposed 
primary and secondary education target in 2030. 
In particular, the lower secondary attainment 
rate is expected to be 50% in low income 
countries, 80% in lower middle income countries 
and 92% in upper middle income countries, if 
recent trends continue.3 Even the achievement 
of universal primary education, a core goal of 
Jomtien and Dakar, appears on current evidence 
beyond reach.

Universal upper secondary education, one of the 
OWG targets, will not be achieved this century. 
It may never be reached; even high income 
countries have progressed towards it very slowly. 
For example, among the 28 European Union 
countries, the percentage of 20- to 24-year-olds 
who had attained upper secondary education 
increased from 77% in 2002 to 81% in 2013 
(Eurostat, 2014).

Given such evidence, a sustained commitment 
among national authorities, international 
partners and civil society would need to be 
secured, and put into practice, for these 
ambitious targets to be achieved. It would be 
instructive for the World Education Forum to 
consider lessons learned from the past 15 
years. How can a new framework for action 
propose more effective mechanisms for global 
coordination and accountability than those 
envisaged in Dakar? How can good practices 
be identified to recommend to individual 
governments? To what extent were the Dakar 
strategies actually adopted and implemented at

POST-2015 EDUCATION GOAL AND TARGETS: STATUS AND PROSPECTSLessons for implementing the new agendathe global and national levels, how successful 
were they, and how can they be amended for 
greater success in the future?

Following the extensive review of the post-
Dakar architecture (see Overview) and drawing 
on 15 years of experience of monitoring EFA 
priorities, this section puts forward lessons and 
recommendations for implementation of the 
post-2015 agenda.

Find new ways to sustain  
political commitment

The scope for international bodies to influence 
national education policies has increased since 
2000. Advances in communications and the flow 
of information have facilitated the process of 
peer-to-peer learning. Increases in the absolute 
volume of aid and more sophisticated monitoring 
of aid programmes’ implementation have meant 
that funders have had considerable influence 
on government decision-making processes, 
despite a general adherence to the principle of 
national ownership.

However, many interventions operated outside 
the framework that the five convening agencies 
agreed in Dakar. In practice, the formal EFA 
coordination mechanisms proved weak in 
helping sustain political commitment, as 
each agency followed separate, minimally 
coordinated paths. Closer cooperation among 
the co-conveners of the World Education 
Forum in Incheon, through joint mechanisms, 
should be seen as a necessary part of a revised 
arrangement after 2015.

Two new developments suggest there will be 
better collaboration, supporting the new agenda. 
First, a weakness of the Dakar Framework, 
compounded by the MDG agenda, was that the 
education targets came to be seen as relevant 
only to countries in the Global South. The 
broader SDG agenda, to be agreed in 2015, aims 
to be universal. The principle of universality 
reinforces the notion that inclusive, equitable 
education of good quality is an essential goal for 
every nation. Securing political commitment to 
a universal education agenda will increase the 
chances of its success.

Second, as will be seen later in the section, there 
are calls for a clearly identified accountability 

mechanism in the post-2015 agenda, which will 
have repercussions for the education sector. 
The absence of such structures undoubtedly 
weakened political commitment in the past; it is 
hoped that the reverse will be true after 2015.

Further diversify knowledge, evidence 
and expertise

Over the past 15 years the availability and variety 
of evidence used in global and national education 
policy-making have expanded considerably. 
However, national decision-making has not 
always reflected robust evidence and data. 
In order to advance, the post-2015 education 
agenda will need to take advantage of diverse 
knowledge, evidence and expertise.

One notable gap in knowledge has related to 
the links between education and other sectors. 
Cross-cutting approaches have emerged, notably 
in the area of early childhood care and education, 
but policy-makers rarely focus on potential 
synergy between sectors. The new sustainable 
development agenda raises expectations that 
this blind spot will be corrected.

The EFA Global Monitoring Report has 
emphasized the role that education can play 
in advancing other development outcomes 
(UNESCO, 2014e). Significant evidence suggests 
that the reverse is also true: a favourable 
development context can accelerate education 
progress. A cross-sectoral approach should 
become a dominant feature of the new education 
agenda and of intervention planning.

Education also holds the key to achieving 
many goals of the post-2015 development 
agenda, notably those related to sustainable 
consumption, access to justice for all and 
peaceful societies. The links between education 
and these goals need to be further explored and 
education programmes and approaches need to 
be transformed to achieve these objectives.

The use of more diverse expertise, including 
from other sectors, will contribute to improved 
educational outcomes. Education development 
can be accelerated by addressing poverty, 
for example through targeted programmes 
in the poorest countries to improve the living 
conditions of households that cannot keep their 
children in school. Such initiatives would require

PART 2: POST-2015CHAPTER 91025Education for All Global Monitoring Reportstronger efforts to plan education interventions 
jointly with infrastructure investment – including 
for water, sanitation, roads and energy – and 
social policy. Meanwhile, knowledge of the 
major impact of poor nutrition in early years 
on subsequent cognitive development should 
spur the education community to advocate for 
interventions at the earliest possible age. And 
insights from the field of psychology can be of 
benefit in many ways, from improving teacher 
training programmes and classroom practices, 
especially in poor settings, to motivating 
disadvantaged young people and adults to 
acquire skills.

The active response of the education community 
to the needs of other sectors, and engagement in 
dialogue with outside experts, will be a positive 
step, helping the field abandon its detrimental 
approach of working in relative isolation.

Further strengthen national policy 
and practice

The agenda’s success will ultimately be judged 
at the national level. The scope and emphasis of 
the proposed education goal and targets point 
to three key directions, which are consistent 
with the lessons of the past 15 years. National 
plans need to be better articulated, with closer 
recognition of relationships between levels of 
education and across sectors; policy-makers 
need to address equity more directly; and 
measures to improve quality need to be more 
clearly elaborated. The agenda brings back a 
comprehensive, integrated view of education 
that many argue was lost when the development 
paradigm was dominated by the MDGs and an 
almost exclusive focus on primary education. 

The experience of national EFA plans that 
duplicated other national efforts suggests that 
the international community should abandon 
such approaches. Instead, more focus should 
be placed on improving existing education, or 
education-related, planning and budgeting 
processes. Governments and development 
partners should identify gaps and continue 
building capacity to ensure that these processes 
capture the full scope of the education agenda. 

Two gaps relating to the cornerstones of the 
new agenda, equity and quality, also show the 
need for better coordination between the global 

and national levels. Very few education plans 
reviewed for this GMR incorporated an analysis 
of equity – and often those that did include one 
did so only on the insistence of development 
partners. Yet new data sources have become 
available since 2000 that disaggregate key 
education indicators by individual characteristics 
and thus can facilitate equity analysis.

Governments are slow to adopt policies that 
promote equity. Marginalized populations lack 
voice and representation; policy-makers do not 
respond to their demands in education planning. 
Bureaucracies may hide behind management 
information systems that they themselves 
control and dismiss evidence that could 
undermine their authority.

This GMR has described various cases where 
education policies discriminate against the 
poor. Government commitment to expanding 
pre-primary education has been weak, with the 
result that private pre-schools, unaffordable to 
those who need them most, have captured a 
larger share of the market since 2000. Reform 
in the language of instruction has been too 
shallow to enable those from minority groups 
to fully benefit from their experience of primary 
education. Adult education programmes, even in 
high income countries, are more likely to reach 
adults with some education qualifications than 
those lacking in basic skills. Across the board, 
little emphasis has been given to non-formal, 
distance and community-based programmes. 
Policies hardly recognize the burden of education 
expenditure carried by households.

Meanwhile, the costs of providing education 
services to, for example, remote and 
underserved populations or people with 
disabilities are comparatively high. And while 
relevant information may be available to 
planners, it is not being used to set targets for 
marginalized groups and pursue the necessary 
policies. The UN Secretary-General has said 
that no goal or target should be considered met 
unless all groups, i.e. ‘disaggregated social and 
economic groups’, have met it (United Nations, 
2014b). The new agenda offers countries the 
opportunity to improve their targeting of policies 
and resources and adapt related indicators to 
their respective national context.

POST-2015 EDUCATION GOAL AND TARGETS: STATUS AND PROSPECTSLessons for implementing the new agendaOn the other hand, this GMR found that all 
national plans reviewed captured aspects 
of quality. This is consistent with the related 
finding that an increasing number of countries 
attempted to measure learning outcomes 
by participating in regional and international 
assessments. However, the treatment of 
education quality in plans still appears 
inadequate, as millions of children struggle to 
acquire even minimum levels of basic skills. 
This finding, which the GMR has communicated 
in recent years, has led to a focus on learning 
outcomes in the post-2015 agenda.

While improving foundation skills is a priority, 
the focus on learning should not be narrow. In 
coming years, countries need to identify what 
skills students should have acquired upon 
completing different education levels, at different 
stages of the lifecycle and across different 
domains. At the same time, more evidence is 
expected on the importance of non-cognitive 
skills and the extent to which education systems 
help students acquire them.

If education plans are to reflect a genuine 
concern for quality, then a higher share of the 
recurrent budget will need to be allocated to 
items other than teacher salaries. This GMR 
has documented several examples where 
core aspects of quality education have not 
been addressed. The knowledge, skills and 
status of early childhood educators have been 
neglected despite evidence of the importance 
of their role and their need for a complex set of 
competencies. Teachers in basic education have 
found themselves insufficiently prepared to teach 
reading to young children, adopt new curricula 
or implement learner-centred, gender-sensitive 
pedagogies. School heads and administrators 
are often not ready to carry out decentralization 
and school-based management reforms aimed 
at improving quality.

The SDGs call on governments to take a fresh 
look at the content of education. Education will 
be the lynchpin of a sustainable development 
agenda whose success relies on individuals, 
throughout their lifetime, acquiring relevant 
knowledge and developing positive attitudes 
to address global challenges. Yet despite this 
emerging emphasis, as well the progress 
made during the United Nations Decade of 

Education for Sustainable Development, many 
countries will need more guidance and support 
to make effective choices on curricula and 
teacher education.

Effectively mobilize far more 
financial resources

The low level of resource mobilization after 2000 
is a key reason EFA targets were not achieved. 
Domestic expenditure increased by 0.8% of GNP 
in low income countries and by 0.5% in lower 
middle income countries between 1999 and 
2012. However, the GMR estimated in 2010 that 
to achieve the pre-primary, primary and literacy 
targets by 2015 in 46 low income countries, an 
additional US$16 billion, equivalent to 1.5% 
of GDP, would have been needed, much of it 
from external sources. The annual cost of also 
achieving universal lower secondary education 
was estimated at an additional US$25 billion  
(at constant 2007 prices) (UNESCO, 2010a).

In advance of the Financing for Development 
Conference in Addis Ababa in July 2015, and 
to contribute to the global debate on the cost 
of the sustainable development agenda, this 
GMR updated its earlier costing exercise to 
understand the level of financial resources that 
will need to be mobilized to achieve the SDG 
targets (Box 9.3).

Here are the key findings of the costing 
exercise (Table 9.2):

 ■ Achieving completion of universal pre-
primary, primary and lower secondary 
education of good quality in low and lower 
middle income countries by 2030 would 
require considerably higher levels of 
spending. Annual total expenditure would 
need to more than double from current 
levels, and some countries would need to 
increase expenditure considerably more than 
that. Annual total costs would quadruple in 
pre-primary education and roughly double in 
primary and lower secondary.

 ■ Part of this increase would be driven by 

higher enrolment. The number of pre-
primary students would more than double by 
2030 (with a sixfold increase in low income 
countries). Lower secondary enrolment would

PART 2: POST-2015CHAPTER 91025Education for All Global Monitoring ReportBox 9.3: A cost analysis for achieving the SDGs

This costing exercise focuses mainly on objectives 
corresponding to the first two of the seven targets of the 
post-2015 agenda. The target for pre-primary education is 
an average gross enrolment ratio of 100%. The primary and 
lower secondary education targets were expressed in terms 
of universal completion rather than enrolment. However, this 
costing exercise also takes into account the cross-cutting 
themes of quality and equity found in other post-2015 targets 
(Table 9.1).

Increasing education quality is a central aspect of the new 
agenda. This costing makes several provisions so that the 
quality of instruction meets minimum standards to ultimately 
achieve the desired learning outcomes: a ceiling for pupil/ 
teacher and pupil/classroom ratios; adequate maintenance 
of classrooms; competitive teacher salaries to support 
the recruitment of talented and motivated teachers; and 
sufficient non-salary expenditure for learning materials and 
administrative support.

With respect to teacher salaries, which are usually the 
single largest cost, the assumptions are driven by the pupil/ 
teacher ratio, which displays considerable variation across 
countries. Overall, both the ratio and the salary (expressed as 
a multiple of GDP per capita) tend to be higher in low income 
countries, reflecting a scarcity of skills. In the costing, it is 
assumed that in each country, as GDP per capita increases, 
the pupil/teacher ratio approaches the overall international 
average by 2030, while the teacher salary approaches the 
international average of countries in the top half of the 
teacher salary distribution.

The projections also take into account the fact that universal 
education can only be realized if there is additional support 
for marginalized out-of-school children, which can take 

the form of free uniforms, tuition support, mother-tongue 
instruction, construction of remote or mobile schools for 
hard-to-reach children or support for disabled children. 
Additional costs for these children are estimated at 20% of 
the cost per pupil for pre-primary and primary education, 
and at 30% for lower secondary education. In low income 
countries, these costs account for about 7% of the total, 
although in some extremely poor countries, such as Burundi, 
Madagascar, Mali and Niger, they rise to between 10% 
and 12%.

The GMR updated its 2010 costing exercise in two ways. 
First, coverage was extended to all 84 low and lower middle 
income countries; this could be expected to increase the 
cost, although less than proportionately as the new countries 
are closer to universal lower secondary education. Second, 
the time horizon for realizing the agenda, previously set to 
the end of 2015, was extended to achieve universal lower 
secondary education completion by 2030; this was expected 
to reduce the annual financing gap estimate, as the costs are 
spread over a much longer period than the last estimate. It 
should also be considered that countries have edged closer 
to the target over the past five years, another factor that 
differentiates these from past estimates.

There is no simple link between spending and education 
outcomes. The same level of spending may produce 
very different results in different countries as a result of 
differences in equity, efficiency and effectiveness. Such major 
differences across countries, as well as considerable data 
gaps, mean there are considerable limitations to any costing 
exercise, so estimates should be treated as indicative. Even 
so, given the level of ambition of the proposed agenda, the 
analysis suggests that lack of adequate finance will be the 
largest obstacle in poorer countries.

increase by over 50%. Primary enrolment 
would grow only marginally.

 ■ The rest of the increase would be due to 

most countries having to substantially raise 
per pupil spending by reducing pupil/teacher 
ratios, increasing expenditure on both 
salaries and non-salary items and boosting 
support for marginalized children. The need 
for increased per pupil expenditure is higher 
at the pre-primary level.

 ■ Domestic resources would not be sufficient 
to achieve these basic education targets by 
2030, even assuming ambitious increases in 
spending. The total annual external financing 
gap – the difference between the estimated 
cost of achieving basic education and the 
estimated available domestic resources  
– is projected to average $US22 billion 
annually between 2015 and 2030 (at 2012 
constant prices).

 ■ Almost half the annual external financing gap, 

or US$10.6 billion, pertains to low income 
countries. For comparison, in 2012 the total 
aid to pre-primary, primary and general 
secondary education in low income countries 

was US$2.3 billion. To achieve the target, the 
level of external assistance would need to at 
least quadruple.

 ■ The exercise did not cost adult literacy 

programmes, in the absence of robust data. 
The previous exercise estimated the cost of 
universal adult literacy at 1.3% of the total 
cost of achieving the basic education target, 
which was too low. The current exercise, 
whose assumptions about increased quality 
imply that all primary education graduates 
will be able to read, indicates that universal 
youth literacy would be achieved by 2030.

The overall external financing gap is projected 
to increase over time (Figure 9.1). The rise is 
most pronounced for low income countries; the 
gap stays relatively constant for lower middle 
income countries. As a proportion of the total 
cost of meeting the basic education targets, the 
financing gap is larger in low income countries, 
where it constitutes 29% of the average annual 
costs, compared with 6% in lower middle 
income countries.

PART 2: POST-2015CHAPTER 91025Education for All Global Monitoring Reportexpenditure on education.4 The expected level of 
public expenditure on pre-primary, primary and 
lower secondary education will need to increase 
to 3.4% of GDP in low and lower middle income 
countries in 2030.

Without these projected increases in public 
expenditure, the financing gap would widen 
substantially. If education budgets stayed at 
their current levels as a proportion of GDP, 
the gap would double to an annual average of 
US$52.5 billion.

Aid will be crucial in filling the gap. External 
financing will be required to make up more 
than one-quarter of the required increase in 
expenditure between 2012 and 2030 in most low 
income countries. Even in lower middle income 
countries, financial and technical support 
will be needed.

Yet total aid to education is predicted to level 
off in coming years. Many donor countries 
report future reductions in their levels of aid 
to education. The poorest countries are likely 
to be the most affected (Global Campaign for 
Education, 2013). Projections indicate aid to 
education disbursements will stagnate between 
2014 and 2017 in low income countries at about 
US$3.7 billion (Figure 9.2). Most increases in aid 
will be to middle income countries, mostly in the 
form of soft loans (OECD, 2014a).

Given the low current levels and anaemic 
prospects of external assistance to education, 
the challenge for donors to increase the volume 
of aid to new levels is daunting. The magnitude 
of the required increase has led some advocates 
to suggest that new financing mechanisms 
may be needed for effective management. In 
view of the long gestation period needed to fully 
develop the structure of the Global Partnership 
for Education, it may be unwise to suggest 
a major institutional overhaul in the area of 
education aid. Yet clearly things must change 
drastically if there is to be any hope of carrying 
out the new agenda.

4. For countries now spending at least 6% of GDP on education, it is assumed 
that this level is maintained. For countries spending less, due either to low 
tax revenue or low priority on education in the budget, tax revenue and the 
share of education in the budget are assumed to increase gradually. The 
share of basic education in the total education budget is set constant at the 
current levels in each country.

POST-2015 EDUCATION GOAL AND TARGETS: STATUS AND PROSPECTSLessons for implementing the new agendaBring the monitoring and reporting of 
progress to a new level

Improved data sources and innovative ways 
of monitoring have been successes of the 
international education agenda since 2000. 
However, there is still a long way to go until 
data on key aspects of educational development 
are collected. The data revolution opens up 
opportunities that could work to the sector’s 
advantage. In addition, there will need to 
be careful consideration of future reporting 
arrangements and the use of reports within the 
framework of an accountability mechanism.

Future data collection will be challenging

The post-2015 agenda is broad and ambitious. In 
order to understand whether the world is moving 
closer to the targets, data are needed in areas 
that have been outside the scope of traditional 
data collection systems. There will need to be 
advances not only in measurement but also 
in institutional development to take on the 
challenges of monitoring at the national level.

competence in language and mathematics is an 
obvious starting point, given their importance as 
foundations for further learning. Early in the new 
agenda’s implementation, it would be desirable 
to develop a common metric linked to national 
learning assessments. Such a development will 
increase awareness of country progress towards 
the target and can spur capacity-building in 
national agencies.

The key outcome in the area of skills is youth 
and adults possessing sufficient proficiency 
in literacy and numeracy to fully participate in 
society. At the moment, only a self-reported 
measure of literacy is available for all countries, 
one which is highly imperfect and oversimplified. 
This GMR has shown that, with the world 
increasingly recognizing literacy and numeracy 
as a continuum of skills, the means of assessing 
them more accurately have considerably 
improved. Various institutions have worked in 
this area, and the time has come to translate the 
lessons learned into cost-effective tools to aid 
in understanding how these core cognitive skills 
are acquired, maintained or lost.

In the area of early childhood, the new agenda’s 
key intended outcome is children reaching their 
developmental potential by primary school 
age and therefore being ready to fully benefit 
from schooling. The measurement of child 
development is an active area of research and 
various indicators have been developed, albeit in a 
relatively limited number of countries. Consensus 
has not been reached on a suitable indicator 
applicable across countries and cultures.

The emphasis of the new agenda on lifelong 
learning highlights the lack of evidence on the 
channels through which adults acquire skills. 
One indicator of lifelong learning opportunities 
has been applied with some success in richer 
countries: the percentage of adults who have 
participated in education and training in a given 
period. Other countries would need to agree that 
such a measure was relevant to them and could 
be used to collect individual-level information.

Attendance in good quality pre-primary school 
programmes is one of several factors associated 
with improved outcomes for children. In addition 
to pre-schools, a wide variety of programmes 
for young children exist that have an organized 
learning component. However, their provision is 
fragmented among many types of institutions, so 
it is hard to understand which children benefit. 
Better systems and surveys are needed to 
address this.

In primary and secondary education, the 
key outcome has to do with the learning 
achievement of children and adolescents. 
Education systems enable children to acquire 
multiple competencies, each of which should 
be monitored. The monitoring of basic 

Key outcomes are harder to define when it 
comes to education for global citizenship and 
sustainable development. The international 
community needs to open dialogue on 
the knowledge, attitudes and, especially, 
observable behaviours that are associated 
with contributing to peaceful and sustainable 
societies. Reaching consensus and revising 
education systems to better serve these could 
be major achievements of the post-2015 agenda. 
A starting point could be determining whether 
existing international surveys of attitudes and 
values capture such aspects as tolerance and 
environmental stewardship.

Concerning all targets, the need for greater 
attention to equity and quality poses major

assessments

PART 2: POST-2015CHAPTER 91025Education for All Global Monitoring Reportmeasurement challenges. In the case of equity, 
the international community will need to rely 
on surveys of children, students or workers 
that provide background information on 
individual beneficiaries of education. Improved 
coordination will be required to make such 
surveys standardized, fit for purpose and 
available for analysis.

The challenge is greater still in the case of 
quality, as consensus remains elusive on what 
aspects of quality in education can be translated 
from research to widespread implementation. 
How can quality be improved? How do classroom 
processes and learning environments help 
children, youth and adults learn?

Two aspects related to professionalism and 
the status of teachers need to be monitored. 
First, comparatively few countries capture the 
percentage of teachers who are trained, and 
the content of their training. Such an indicator 
could be used to improve national approaches 
to teacher education. Second, while teachers’ 
incentives vary, their pay relative to other 
professions is an important factor. This can be 
captured through labour force surveys. Changes 
in the relative position of teachers could be a 
good predictor of their status over time.

Finally, in the area of finance, large gaps in 
data collection and analysis hinder a clear 
understanding of how to finance education 
development. This has received scarce attention. 
The data need to be accurate, cover many 
countries and be reported in a timely manner. 
It should be noted that standard indicators of 
public education expenditure, whether as a 
percentage of GNP or as a percentage of total 
education expenditure, do not track the entire 
national effort on education. National education 
accounts, modelled on those in the health sector 
and accurately reflecting the respective shares of 
the government, donors and households in total 
education financing, are badly needed.

Progress in data collection will not come 
automatically. The international community 
needs to rethink how it prioritizes its data 
agenda and allocates funds for research and 
monitoring. The proposals of the Independent 
Expert Advisory Group on a Data Revolution 
for Sustainable Development suggest some 
directions useful for the education sector. 

National authorities also need to bear in mind 
the emphasis of the post-2015 education 
agenda on equity and learning, which has major 
implications for the kind of information they 
collect and use for policy-making. The capacity 
of both international and national institutions will 
need to strengthen to tackle such challenges.

Linking reporting with accountability

Data improvement will not by itself bring 
progress on education. Better data will only help 
if they trigger actions to improve the educational 
opportunities of the most vulnerable. For that 
to occur, good reports are needed that monitor 
trends and summarize key evidence in ways 
easily understood by policy-makers, along 
with explicitly identified mechanisms that use 
the reports to hold governments and donors 
accountable for their actions and help them 
learn from their mistakes.

As the mandate of the EFA Global Monitoring 
Report ends in 2015, a critical juncture has been 
reached. Some have called for a single report 
covering all the goals of the new development 
agenda. However, this would likely weaken the 
links between the international community and 
individual countries or development sectors. A 
global report on the entire set of post-2015 goals 
would be unlikely to go into sufficient depth 
and would need to be complemented by more 
comprehensive, sector-specific reports at the 
global level, such as the GMR, so as to share 
best practices in policy-making and empower 
local actors. 

Global (or, for that matter, regional and national) 
monitoring reports should be seen as a way 
for governments and international donors to 
document actions taken and results achieved 
relative to the targets set and commitments 
made. The EFA and MDG processes lacked an 
accountability mechanism (Janus and Keijzer, 
2014), at least partly because of the challenge 
of clearly describing partners’ roles and 
responsibilities. Governments and international 
donors are naturally reluctant to be held 
accountable for commitments to which they do 
not believe they are legally bound. Consequently, 
the GMR could not play its role to the full extent.

The post-2015 agenda is renewing the debate 
on accountability. UN member states have

POST-2015 EDUCATION GOAL AND TARGETS: STATUS AND PROSPECTSLessons for implementing the new agendaagreed on some basic structures. The High-level 
Political Forum on Sustainable Development will 
oversee regular reviews of SDG implementation 
starting in 2016. The reviews will be state led 
and voluntary but will include relevant UN 
entities and provide a platform for partnerships 
with other stakeholders. Member states have 
also agreed that the forum should promote 
and facilitate the sharing of best practices, 
as well as countries’ successes, challenges 
and lessons learned while implementing the 
agenda (UNGA, 2013). The General Assembly 
has agreed that the review mechanism will 
include a global sustainable development report, 
but has also accepted that other assessments, 
whether official or non-official, may inform it 
(UNGA, 2014).

The Synthesis Report of the United Nations 
Secretary-General in December 2014 argued 
that the review mechanism should include all 
actors – governments, international institutions, 
the private sector and civil society – to promote 
mutual accountability. The universal review 
process would be initiated at the national 
level and would inform national, regional 
and global reviews. Suggested components 
include a country-led, national component for 
accountability, a regional component for peer 
reviewing, a global component for knowledge 
sharing, a thematic component to chart global 
progress at regular intervals (which is where the 
future form of the GMR fits in) and a component 
to review international support and the global 
partnership for sustainable development (United 
Nations, 2014b).

These mechanisms should go beyond tracking 
progress towards the goals, serving as a means 
to examine and share experiences of policy-
making and resource allocation. In that context, 
the Secretary-General has called for a regional 
peer review mechanism. As regions have many 
challenges in common in education, the sharing 
of country experiences through peer review 
could make policy-making more effective.

The proposed accountability mechanisms 
should be integrated with established national 
and international institutions. At the national 
level, these include parliamentary oversight 
committees, audit bodies, the judiciary and legal 
system, administrative hearings and service 
delivery grievance procedures. Within the 

education sector, countries are likely to have 
other institutions promoting accountability, such 
as parent-teacher associations, academic and 
research networks and teacher unions.

At the global level, international human rights 
bodies, transnational regulatory networks, UN 
agencies and other intergovernmental political 
institutions will play a role (OHCHR, 2013). The 
education sector has its own set of international 
institutions and associations, some of which 
may need to be strengthened to meet the 
expectations of the post-2015 agenda.

Conclusion 

The post-2015 sustainable development agenda 
commits all members of the international 
community to an ambitious universal vision 
of heightened human dignity, gender equality, 
reduced inequality, safe and peaceful societies 
and the protection of the planet. The proposed 
education goal of ensuring inclusive and 
equitable quality education and promoting 
life-long learning opportunities for all – and its 
specific targets – are embedded in this broad 
vision, and closely align with the aspirations of 
the EFA movement. However, as this chapter 
showed, the formulation of the proposed 
education targets could be considerably 
improved to make them specific, measurable, 
realistic and relevant. 

The lofty SDG agenda has devised a practical 
plan to chart the way forward for countries 
and development partners and help mobilize 
adequate means to implement the agreed upon 
goals and targets. In the area of education, we 
can draw lessons from the implementation of 
past EFA strategies to help accelerate progress 
in the coming years. The international education 
community will have to find solutions to the 
issues of political commitment, and the need 
for increased financing and accountability 
mechanisms. Governments and donors alike 
will need to address issues of equity and quality 
in their policies and programmes – and build 
and use links between education and other 
development sectors towards a successful 
post-2015 agenda.

Introduction

These tables provide a global overview of 
national learning assessments undertaken 
in countries between 1995 and 2013. 
National learning assessments evaluate 
learning outcomes on the basis of criteria 
and expectations set by national education 
authorities. Such assessments aim to provide 
education decision makers with systematic 
information about the status of students’ 
learning and the extent to which students attain 
predefined standards or proficiencies. As the 
scientific reliability and validity of national 
assessments vary greatly, cross-country 
comparisons should be undertaken with care. 
Nevertheless, national assessments provide 
country-wide information about an array of 
learning outcomes according to nationally 
defined standards and pinpoint areas for 
government attention and policy intervention. 
Furthermore, they explicitly address the EFA 
quality goal that refers to ‘recognized and 
measurable learning outcomes’, as well as 
the Expanded Commentary, which discusses 
the need for ‘accurately assessed curricular 
knowledge and skills’.

Information for the tables was compiled from 
numerous sources (e.g. printed material, 
websites, experts, contacts through UNESCO 
regional offices), some of which were partial and/
or contradictory. Much effort has been made to 
verify and cross-check the reported information, 
but some errors are likely. For further details 
and analysis of the national learning assessment 
database see Benavot and Köseleci, 2015. It was 
not possible to evaluate the scientific rigour or 
technical soundness of the assessments listed, 
although efforts in this direction are anticipated 
in the coming years.

Introduction

Population 

The most recent data on pupils, students, 
teachers and education expenditure presented 
in these statistical tables are   the reference 
school and financial years ending in 2012.2  
They are based on survey results reported to 
and processed by the UNESCO Institute for 
Statistics (UIS) before the end of March 2014. 
Data received and processed after that date are 
published on the UIS website and will be used 
in the 2016 Global Education Monitoring Report. 
A small number of countries3 submitted data 
for the school year ending in 2013, which are 
presented in bold in the statistical tables.

These statistics refer to all formal schools, 
both public and private, by level of education. 
They are supplemented by demographic and 
economic statistics collected or produced by 
other international organizations, including the 
Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS 
(UNAIDS), the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD), the United 
Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United 
Nations Population Division, the World Bank and 
the World Health Organization (WHO).

 The statistical tables list a total of 207 countries 
and territories. Most of them report their data 
to the UIS using standard questionnaires issued 
by the institute. Education data are collected for 
some countries in two other ways: by the UIS 
via surveys carried out with support from the 
World Education Indicators (WEI) programme, or 
jointly by the UIS, the OECD and the Statistical 
Office of the European Union (Eurostat) through 
the UIS/OECD/Eurostat (UOE) questionnaires. 
These countries are indicated with symbols in 
the section below on composition of regions and 
other country groups.

The indicators on school access and 
participation in the statistical tables are based 
on the 2012 revision of population estimates 
produced by the United Nations Population 
Division. Because of possible differences 
between national population estimates and those 
of the United Nations, these indicators may differ 
from those published by individual countries 
or by other organizations.4 The Population 
Division does not provide data by single years 
of age for countries with a total population of 
less than 50,000. Where no Population Division 
estimates existed, national population figures, 
when available, or UIS estimates were used to 
calculate enrolment ratios.

ISCED classification

Education data reported to the UIS since 1998 
conform to the 1997 revision of the International 
Standard Classification of Education 
(ISCED-97). Data for the school year ending 
in 1991, presented in statistical tables 12 and 
13 (website), were collected according to the 
previous version of the classification, ISCED-76. 
Where possible, the UIS has adjusted these 
data to comply with ISCED-97 and to improve 
comparisons over time for years after 1997. 
ISCED is used to harmonize data and introduce 
better international comparability across 
national education systems. Countries may 
have their own definitions of education levels 
that do not correspond to ISCED. Therefore, 
some differences between nationally and 
internationally reported education statistics 
may be due to two factors: the use of nationally 
defined education levels rather than the ISCED 
standard, and the population issue raised above.

1. A full set of statistics and indicators related to this introduction is found in 
Excel tables on the EFA Global Monitoring Report website at www.efareport.
unesco.org
2. This means 2011/12 for countries with a school year that overlaps two 
calendar years, and 2012 for those with a calendar school year. The most 
recent reference year for education finance for WEI and UOE countries is the 
year ending in 2011
3. Brunei Darussalam, Djibouti, Ghana, Kazakhstan, Morocco, Nepal, Palau, 
Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Thailand.

4. Where obvious inconsistencies exist between enrolment reported by 
countries and the United Nations population data, the UIS may decide not to 
calculate or publish enrolment ratios. This is the case for Andorra, Brazil, 
Ethiopia, Kuwait and Singapore, where enrolment ratios at all levels of 
education are not published for one or both of the reference school years, 
and for Albania, Armenia, Bahrain, Bosnia Herzegovina, Cayman Islands, 
Jamaica, Macao (China), Malaysia, Maldives, Qatar, and the United Arab 
Emirates, where publication of enrolment ratios at some levels of education 
is suspended.

STATISTICAL TABLESIntroductionAdult participation in education

ISCED does not classify education programmes 
by participants’ age. For example, any 
programme with content equivalent to primary 
education, or ISCED 1, may be classed as 
such even if provided to adults. UIS guidance 
for its regular annual education survey, on the 
other hand, asks countries to exclude ‘data 
on programmes designed for people beyond 
regular school age’. Guidance for the UOE 
and WEI questionnaires until 2005 stated that 
‘activities classified as “continuing”, “adult” or 
“non-formal” education should be included’ if 
they ‘involve studies with subject content similar 
to regular educational programmes’ or if ‘the 
underlying programmes lead to similar potential 
qualifications’ as the regular programmes. 
Since 2005, however, UIS has requested 
countries involved in the UOE and WEI survey 
to report data for such programmes separately 
so they can be excluded when calculating 
internationally comparable indicators. Despite 
this, annual survey data from some countries 
may still include students, or participants, 
who are substantially above the official age for 
basic education.

Literacy data

UNESCO has long defined literacy as the 
ability to read and write, with understanding, 
a short simple statement related to one’s 
daily life. However, a parallel definition arose 
with the introduction in 1978 of the notion 
of functional literacy, which emphasizes the 
use of literacy skills. That year the UNESCO 
General Conference approved the definition of 
functionally literacy as being able to engage in 
all activities in which literacy is required for the 
effective functioning of a person’s group and 
community and which also enables them to 
continue to use reading, writing and calculation 
for their own and the community’s development.

In many cases, the literacy statistics in the 
corresponding table rely on the first definition. 
They are mainly based on data sources that 
use self or third party declaration methods in 

which respondents are asked whether they and 
the members of their household are literate, as 
opposed to being asked a more comprehensive 
question or to demonstrate literacy skills.5 Some 
countries assume that persons who complete 
a certain level of education are literate.6 As 
definitions and methodologies used for data 
collection differ by country, data need to be used 
with caution.

 Literacy data in this report cover adults aged 
15 years and over as well as youth aged 15 to 24 
and refer to three periods, 1985–1994, 1995-
2004 and 2005–2012. They include national 
observed data from censuses and household 
surveys, indicated with an asterisk (*), and UIS 
estimates for 1994, 2004 and 2012, based on 
the most recent national observed data and 
produced using the Global Age-specific Literacy 
Projections Model (GALP).7 The reference years 
and literacy definitions for each country are 
presented in the table of metadata for literacy 
statistics posted on the EFA Global Monitoring 
Report website.

 In many countries, interest in assessing the 
literacy skills of the population is growing. 
In response, the UIS has developed a 
methodology and data collection instrument 
called the Literacy Assessment and Monitoring 
Programme (LAMP). Following the example of 
the International Adult Literacy Survey (IALS), 
LAMP is based on assessment of actual and 
functional literacy skills. It aims to provide 
higher quality literacy data based on the concept 
of a continuum of literacy skills rather than the 
common dichotomy of literate vs illiterate.

5. In the new data released by the UIS, some literacy rates are based on direct 
tests rather than individuals’ declarations. This is the case in Benin, Central 
African Republic, Congo, Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 
Egypt, Ethiopia, Gabon, Guyana, Haiti, Jordan, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, 
Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritania, Namibia, Nepal, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, 
Sao Tome and Principe, the United Republic of Tanzania, Zambia and 
Zimbabwe. The use of measures based on direct tests largely explains the 
observed decline in literacy rates for some years in many of these countries. 
Care should therefore be taken when analysing trends over time and when 
interpreting these results.
6. For reliability and consistency, the UIS does not publish literacy data 
based on educational attainment proxies. Only data reported by countries 
based on self or household declaration are included in the statistical tables. 
However, in the absence of such data, educational attainment proxies for 
some countries, particularly developed ones, are used to compute regional 
weighted averages and the EFA Development Index.
7. For a description of the GALP methodology, see UNESCO, 2006b  
and UIS (2006).

ANNEXEducation for All Global Monitoring ReportEducation for All Global Monitoring Report1025Estimates and missing data

Capped figures

Both observed and estimated education data 
are presented throughout the statistical 
tables. When data are not reported to the UIS 
using the standard questionnaires, estimates 
are often necessary. Wherever possible, the 
UIS encourages countries to make their own 
estimates, which are presented as national 
estimates and marked with one asterisk (*). 
Where this does not happen, the UIS may 
make its own estimates based on available 
supplementary information. These are marked 
with two asterisks (**). Gaps in the tables may 
also arise where data submitted by a country 
are found to be inconsistent. The UIS makes 
every attempt to resolve such problems with 
the countries concerned, but reserves the final 
decision to omit problematic data. To fill the 
gaps in the statistical tables, data for earlier or 
more recent school years are included when 
information for the school years ending in 
1999 and 2012 is not available. Such cases are 
indicated by a footnote.

Regional and other country 
grouping averages

Regional figures for literacy rates, gross and 
adjusted net intake rates, gross, net and 
adjusted net enrolment ratios, school life 
expectancy and pupil/teacher ratios are weighted 
averages, taking into account the relative size 
of the relevant population of each country in 
each region. The figures for countries with 
larger populations thus have a proportionately 
greater influence on the regional aggregates. 
The averages are derived from both published 
data and imputed values for countries for which 
no recent or reliable and publishable data are 
available. Weighted averages marked with 
two asterisks (**) in the tables are UIS partial 
imputations due to incomplete country coverage 
(between 33% and 60% of the population of 
a given region or country grouping). Where 
insufficient reliable data are available to produce 
an overall weighted mean, a median figure 
is calculated based only on countries with 
available data. 

Some indicators should theoretically not exceed 
100% – for example, net intake rates and net 
enrolment ratios – but may do so because of 
inconsistency of data. In these cases, the total 
male and female values of the given indicator are 
recalculated and lowered using a capping factor, 
so that the gender parity index of the new set of 
values remains the same as for the uncapped 
values. The theoretical maximum value is 
determined from the raw data used to calculate 
the family of related indicators to which a given 
indicator belongs. 

For instance, net enrolment ratios in primary 
education are capped using a factor that takes 
into account the male and female primary school 
age populations and the enrolment of primary 
school age boys and girls in pre-primary, primary 
and secondary education. If the total enrolment 
of primary school age children, whether male 
or female, is higher than the corresponding 
population, all net enrolment indicators – 
such as net enrolment ratio and adjusted net 
enrolment ratio – and their derivative indicators, 
such as the out-of-school rate, are capped, 
using the same capping factor. In this case, 
the capping factor is calculated by taking the 
maximum of the male and female enrolments 
and dividing it by the population of primary 
school age children.

Data processing timetable

The timetable for collection and publication of 
data used in this report was:

June 2012, or December 
2012 for countries with a 
calendar school year

January 2013 and June 2013

June and August 2013

January–December 2013

October–December 2013

Mid-February 2014

April 2014

The final school year in the data collection period 
ended.

Questionnaires were sent to countries whose data are 
collected directly either by the UIS or through the WEI/
UOE questionnaires, with data submission deadlines of 
30 April and 30 September, respectively.

The UIS sent countries reminders by e-mail, fax, phone 
and/or post.
The UIS began to process data upon receipt, made 
estimates for missing data and calculated indicators.
Provisional statistical tables were produced and draft 
indicators sent to member states for review.
The first draft of the statistical tables was produced for 
the EFA Global Monitoring Report.
The final statistical tables were sent to the EFA Global 
Monitoring Report team by a deadline of 17 April.

Note A:  The statistical tables still include data for Netherlands Antilles in Latin America and the Caribbean, and for Sudan (pre-secession) in the Arab States, for reference purposes only, since data for the new entities, Curaçao, Saint-Martin, Sint 
Maarten, Sudan and South Sudan, are just becoming available. The country groupings by level of income are as defined by the World Bank but include EFA countries only. They are based on the list of countries by income group as revised in 
July 2013.

Note B: The median values for 1998 and 2012 are not comparable since they are not necessarily based on the same number of countries.

1. The demographic indicators are from the United Nations Population Division estimates, revision 2012 (United Nations, 2013). They are based on the median variant.

2. World Bank WDI database, April 2014 release.

3. OECD-DAC database.

4. UNDP (2013).

5. Data are for the most recent year available during the period specified. For more details see UNDP (2013).

(...) No data available.

Source: UIS database. 

Note A: The statistical tables still include data for Netherlands Antilles in Latin America and the Caribbean, and for Sudan (pre-secession) in the Arab States, for reference purposes only, since data for the new entities, Curaçao, Saint-Martin, Sint 
Maarten, Sudan and South Sudan, are just becoming available. The country groupings by level of income are as defined by the World Bank but include EFA countries only. They are based on the list of countries by income group as revised in July 
2013. 

Note B: For countries indicated with (*), national observed literacy data are used. For all others, UIS literacy estimates are used (**). The estimates were generated using the UIS Global Age-specific Literacy Projections model. Those in the most 
recent period are for 2012 and are based on the most recent observed data available for each country. 

Note C: The population used to generate the number of illiterates is from the United Nations Population Division estimates, revision 2012 (United Nations, 2013). It is based on the median variant. For countries with national observed literacy data, 
the population corresponding to the year of the census or survey was used. For countries with UIS estimates, populations used are for 2004 and 2012. 

1. Data are for the most recent year available during the period specified. See the introduction to the statistical tables and the table of metadata on literacy statistics for a broader explanation of national literacy definitions, assessment methods, and 
sources and years of data.

(a) Literacy data are based on direct reading tests in national household surveys.

(*) For country level data: national estimate.

(**) For country level data: UIS estimate/projection; for regional and other country-grouping sums and weighted averages: partial imputation due to incomplete country coverage (between 33% and 60% of population for the region or other country 
grouping)

(...) No data available.

Note: The statistical tables still include data for Netherlands Antilles in Latin America and the Caribbean, and for Sudan (pre-secession) in the Arab States, for reference purposes only, since data for the new entities, Curaçao, Saint-Martin, 
Sint Maarten, Sudan and South Sudan, are just becoming available. The country groupings by level of income are as defined by the World Bank but include EFA countries only. They are based on the list of countries by income group as 
revised in July 2013.

1. The indicators on child survival are from the United Nations Population Division estimates, revision 2012 (United Nations, 2013). They are based on the median variant. 

2. UNICEF (2014); WHO Global Database on Child Growth and Malnutrition (2014).

3. Data are for the most recent year available during the period specified.

Source: UIS database. Enrolment ratios are based on the United Nations Population Division estimates, revision 2012 (United Nations, 2013), median variant. 

Note A: The statistical tables still include data for Netherlands Antilles in Latin America and the Caribbean, and for Sudan (pre-secession) in the Arab States, for reference purposes only, since data for the new entities, Curaçao, Saint-Martin, Sint 
Maarten, Sudan and South Sudan, are just becoming available. The country groupings by level of income are as defined by the World Bank but include EFA countries only. They are based on the list of countries by income group as revised in July 
2013.

Note B: The median values for 1999 and 2012 are not comparable since they are not necessarily based on the same number of countries.

1. Enrolment ratios for one or both of the two school years were not calculated due to inconsistencies in the population data. 

2. National population data were used to calculate enrolment ratios.

3. Enrolment and population data exclude Transnistria. 

4. Enrolment and population data exclude the Nagorno-Karabakh region.

5. The 47% increase in total enrolment between 2010 and 2012 is due to changes in data source and coverage. Previously data came from the National Pre-school Census and did not include pre-school programmes in long day care settings. The 
new data source, which does include such programmes, is the National Early Childhood Education and Care data collection.  

6. Enrolment ratios for one or both of the two school years were not calculated due to lack of United Nations population data by age. 

7. Data include French overseas departments and territories (DOM-TOM). 

8. Pre-primary enrolment increased from 382,740 in 2011 to 1,429,012 in 2012 due to the reporting of “O” class and child to child data for the first time in the academic year 2011/12. “O” class enrolment was 1,031,151.

Data in bold are for the school year ending in 2013, those in italics are for 2000 and those in bold italic are for 2001.

(z) Data are for the school year ending in 2011.

(y) Data are for the school year ending in 2010.

(*) National estimate.

(**) For country level data: UIS partial estimate; for regional and other country grouping sums and weighted averages: partial imputation due to incomplete country coverage (between 33% and 60% of population for the region or other country 
grouping).

(-) Magnitude nil or negligible

(.) The category is not applicable or does not exist.

(...) No data available.

Source: UIS database. Intake rates and enrolment ratios used to calculate school life expectancy are based on the United Nations Population Division estimates, revision 2012 (United Nations, 2013), median variant. 

Note: The statistical tables still include data for Netherlands Antilles in Latin America and the Caribbean, and for Sudan (pre-secession) in the Arab States, for reference purposes only, since data for the new entities, Curaçao, Saint-Martin, Sint Maarten, Sudan 
and South Sudan, are just becoming available. The country groupings by level of income are as defined by the World Bank but include EFA countries only. They are based on the list of countries by income group as revised in July 2013.

1. Information on compulsory education comes from various sources: Internation Bureau of Education World Data on Education (7th edition); national law and policies on minimum ages; Eurydice( 2012); etc.

2. Intake rates were not calculated for one or both of the two school years due to population data inconsistencies. 

3. National population data were used to calculate intake rates. 

4. New entrants and population data exclude Transnistria. 

5. New entrants and population data exclude the Nagorno-Karabakh region.

6. Children can enter primary school at age 6 or 7.

7.  Intake rates for one or both of the two school years were not calculated due to lack of United Nations population data by age.

8.  Data include French overseas departments and territories (DOM-TOM).

Data in bold are for the school year ending in 2013, those in italic are for 2000 and those in bold italic are for 2001.

(z) Data are for the school year ending in 2011.

(y) Data are for the school year ending in 2010.

(*) National estimate.

(**) For country level data: UIS partial estimate; for regional and other country grouping sums and weighted averages: partial imputation due to incomplete country coverage (between 33% and 60% of population for the region or other country grouping).

Sources: UIS database. Enrolment ratios are based on the United Nations Population Division estimates, revision 2012 (United Nations, 2013), median variant. 

Note A: The statistical tables still include data for Netherlands Antilles in Latin America and the Caribbean, and for Sudan (pre-secession) in the Arab States, for reference purposes only, since data for the new entities, Curaçao, Saint-Martin, Sint Maarten, 
Sudan and South Sudan, are just becoming available. The country groupings by level of income are as defined by the World Bank but include EFA countries only. They are based on the list of countries by income group as revised in July 2013. 

Note B: The median values for 1999 and 2012 are not comparable since they are not necessarily based on the same number of countries.

1. Data are for 2012 except for countries with a split calendar school year, in which case data are for 2011.

2. Data reflect the actual number of children not enrolled at all, derived from the age-specific or adjusted net enrolment ratio (ANER) of primary school age children, which measures the proportion of those who are enrolled in either primary or secondary 
school.    

3. Enrolment ratios for one or both of the two school years were not calculated due to inconsistencies in the population data. 

4. National population data were used to calculate enrolment ratios.

5. Enrolment and population data exclude Transnistria.

6. In the Russian Federation, two education structures formerly existed, both starting at age 7. The most widespread one, lasting three years, was used to calculate indicators; the other, accounting for about one-third of primary pupils, had four grades. In 
2004, the four-grade structure was extended over the whole country.

7. Enrolment and population data exclude the Nagorno-Karabakh region. 

8. Children enter primary school at age 6 or 7. Since 7 is the most common entrance age, enrolment ratios were calculated using the 7–11 age group for population. 

9. Enrolment ratios for one or both of the two school years were not calculated due to lack of United Nations population data by age. 

10. Data include French overseas departments and territories (DOM-TOM).

11. Due to the continuing discrepancy in enrolment by single age, the NER is estimated using the age distribution from the 2011 MICS. 

Data in bold are for the school year ending in 2013, those in italics are for 2000 and those in bold italic are for 2001.

(z) Data are for the school year ending in 2011.

(y) Data are for the school year ending in 2010.

(*) National estimate.

(**) For country level data: UIS partial estimate; for regional and other country grouping sums and weighted averages: partial imputation due to incomplete country coverage (between 33% and 60% of population for the region or other country grouping).

(-) Magnitude nil or negligible

(.) The category is not applicable or does not exist.

(...) No data available.

Note: The statistical tables still include data for Netherlands Antilles in Latin America and the Caribbean, and for Sudan (pre-secession) in the Arab States, for reference purposes only, since data for the new entities, Curaçao, Saint-Martin, Sint 
Maarten, Sudan and South Sudan, are just becoming available. The country groupings by level of income are as defined by the World Bank but include EFA countries only. They are based on the list of countries by income group as revised in 
July 2013.

1. Duration in this table is defined according to ISCED97 and may differ from that reported nationally. 

Data in bold are for the school year ending in 2012 for survival and primary cohort completion rates, and the school year ending in 2013 for percentage and number of repeaters (all grades) and number of early school leavers (all grades). 
Those in italic are for 2000 and those in bold italic are for 2001.

(z) Data are for the school year ending in 2011.

(y) Data are for the school year ending in 2010.

(x) Data are for the school year ending in 2009. 

(*) National estimate.

(**) UIS partial estimate.

(-) Magnitude nil or negligible.

(.) The category is not applicable or does not exist.

Source: UIS database. Enrolment ratios are based on the United Nations Population Division estimates, revision 2012 (United Nations, 2013), median variant. 

Note: The statistical tables still include data for Netherlands Antilles in Latin America and the Caribbean, and for Sudan (pre-secession) in the Arab States, for reference purposes only, since data for the new entities, Curaçao, Saint-Martin, Sint Maarten, Sudan 
and South Sudan, are just becoming available. The country groupings by level of income are as defined by the World Bank but include EFA countries only. They are based on the list of countries by income group as revised in July 2013.

1. Refers to lower and upper secondary education (ISCED levels 2 and 3).

2. Data are for 2012 except for countries with a split calendar school year, in which case data are for 2011.

3. Data reflect the actual number of adolescents not enrolled at all, derived from the lower secondary total net enrolment ratio (NERT), which measures the proportion of lower secondary school age adolescents who are enrolled in primary, secondary, post-
secondary or tertiary education.

4. Enrolment ratios for one or both of the two school years were not calculated due to inconsistencies in the population data.

5. National population data were used to calculate enrolment ratios. 

6. Enrolment and population data exclude Transnistria.

7. Enrolment and population data exclude the Nagorno-Karabakh region.

8. Enrolment data for upper secondary education include adult education (students over age 25), particularly in pre-vocational/vocational programmes, in which males are in the majority. This explains the high GER and relatively low GPI.

9. Enrolment ratios for one or both of the two school years were not calculated due to lack of United Nations population data by age.

10. Data include French overseas departments and territories.

Data in bold are for the school year ending in 2012 for transition rates, and the school year ending in 2013 for enrolment, enrolment ratios and others indicators in this table. Those in italic are for 2000 and those in bold italic are for 2001.

(z) Data are for the school year ending in 2011.

(y) Data are for the school year ending in 2010.

(x) Data are for the school year ending in 2009. 

(*) National estimate.

(**) For country level data: UIS partial estimate; for regional and other country grouping sums and weighted averages: partial imputation due to incomplete country coverage (between 33% and 60% of population for the region or other country grouping).

(-) Magnitude nil or negligible.

(.) The category is not applicable or does not exist.

(...) No data available.

Sources: UIS database; EFA Global Monitoring Report Team calculations for the pupil/trained teacher ratio.

Note: The statistical tables still include data for Netherlands Antilles in Latin America and the Caribbean, and for Sudan (pre-secession) in the Arab States, for reference purposes only, since data for the new entities, Curaçao, Saint-Martin, Sint Maarten, Sudan

Note: The statistical tables still include data for Netherlands Antilles in Latin America and the Caribbean, and for Sudan (pre-secession) in the Arab States, for reference purposes only, since data for the new entities, Curaçao, Saint-Martin, Sint Maarten, Sudan 
and South Sudan, are just becoming available. The country groupings by level of income are as defined by the World Bank but include EFA countries only. They are based on the list of countries by income group as revised in July 2013.

1. All regional values shown are medians. The median values of 1999 and 2012 are not comparable since they are not necessarily based on the same number of countries.

Data in bold are for the school year ending in 2013, those in italic are for 2000 and those in bold italic are for 2001.

(z) Data are for the school year ending in 2011.

(y) Data are for the school year ending in 2010.

(x) Data are for the school year ending in 2009. 

(*) National estimate.

(**) UIS partial estimate.

(-) Magnitude nil or negligible

Sources: UIS database. Enrolment ratios are based on the United Nations Population Division estimates, revision 2012 (United Nations, 2013), median variant. 

Note: The statistical tables still include data for Netherlands Antilles in Latin America and the Caribbean, and for Sudan (pre-secession) in the Arab States, for reference purposes only, since data for the new entities, Curaçao, Saint-Martin, Sint Maarten, Sudan and 
South Sudan, are just becoming available. The country groupings by level of income are as defined by the World Bank but include EFA countries only. They are based on the list of countries by income group as revised in July 2013.

1. The primary adjusted net enrolment ratio (ANER) measures the proportion of primary school age children who are enrolled in either primary or secondary school.      

2. Data are for the most recent year available during the period specified. See the web version of the introduction to the statistical tables for a broader explanation of national literacy definitions, assessment methods, and sources and years of data. For countries 
indicated with (*), national observed literacy data are used. For all others, UIS literacy estimates are used. The estimates were generated using the UIS Global Age-specific Literacy Projections model. Those in the most recent period are for 2012 and are based on 
the most recent observed data available for each country. 

3. Based on headcounts of pupils and teachers.

4. Enrolment ratios for one or both of the two school years were not calculated due to inconsistencies in the population data. 

5. National population data were used to calculate enrolment ratios.

6. Enrolment and population data used to calculate enrolment ratios exclude Transnistria. 

7.  In the Russian Federation two education structures existed in the past, both starting at age 7. The most common or widespread one lasted three years and was used to calculate indicators; the second one, in which about one-third of primary pupils were 
enrolled, had four grades. Since 2004, the four-grade structure has been extended all over the country.

8. Enrolment and population data exclude the Nagorno-Karabakh region. 

9. Children enter primary school at age 6 or 7. Since 7 is the most common entrance age, enrolment ratios were calculated using the 7–11 age group for both enrolment and population. 

10. Enrolment ratios for one or both of the two school years were not calculated due to lack of United Nations population data by age.

11. Data include French overseas departments and territories (DOM-TOM).

12. Due to the continuing discrepancy in enrolment by single age, the NER is estimated using the age distribution from the 2011 MICS.

Data in bold are for the school year ending in 2013, those in italic are for 2000 and those in bold italic are for 2001.

Education for All Global Monitoring Report1025Aid tables

Introduction1

The data on aid used in this Report are derived 
from the OECD International Development 
Statistics (IDS) databases, which record 
information provided annually by all member 
countries of the OECD Development Assistance 
Committee (DAC), as well as a growing number of 
donors that are not members of the committee. 
The IDS databases are the DAC databases, which 
provided project- and activity-level data. In this 
Report, total figures for net official development 
assistance (ODA) comes from the DAC database 
while those for gross ODA, sector-allocable aid 
and aid to education come from the Creditor 
Reporter System (CRS). Both are available at 
www.oecd.org/dac/stats/idsonline.

Official development assistance is public funds 
provided to developing countries to promote 
their economic and social development. It is 
concessional; that is, it takes the form either of 
a grant or a loan carrying a lower rate of interest 
than is available on the market and, usually, a 
longer repayment period.

A more extensive version of the aid tables 
including ODA per recipient is available on the 
Report’s website, www.efareport.unesco.org.

Aid recipients and donors

Developing countries are those in Part 1 of the 
DAC List of Aid Recipients: all low and middle 
income countries except twelve Central and 
Eastern European countries and a few more 
advanced developing countries.

Bilateral donors are countries that provide 
development assistance directly to recipient 
countries. Most are members of the DAC, a 
forum of major bilateral donors established 
to promote aid and its effectiveness. Bilateral 
donors also contribute substantially to the 
financing of multilateral donors through 
contributions recorded as multilateral ODA. 

1. A full set of statistics and indicators related to the introduction is posted  
in Excel format on the EFA Global Monitoring Report website at  
www.efareport.unesco.org.

Multilateral donors are international institutions 
with government membership that conduct all 
or a significant part of their activities in favour of 
developing countries. They include multilateral 
development banks (e.g. the World Bank and 
Inter-American Development Bank), United 
Nations agencies and regional groupings (e.g. 
the European Commission). The development 
banks also make non-concessional loans to 
several middle and higher income countries; 
these are not counted as part of ODA.

Types of aid

Total ODA: bilateral and multilateral aid for all 
sectors, as well as aid that is not allocable by 
sector, such as general budget support and debt 
relief. In Table 1, total ODA from bilateral donors 
is bilateral aid only, while aid as a percentage 
of gross national income (GNI) is bilateral and 
multilateral ODA.

Sector-allocable ODA: aid allocated to a  
specific sector, such as education or health.  
It does not include aid for general development 
purposes (e.g. general budget support),  
balance-of-payments support, debt relief  
or emergency assistance.

Debt relief: includes debt forgiveness, i.e. the 
extinction of a loan by agreement between the 
creditor (donor) and debtor (aid recipient), and 
other action on debt, including debt swaps,  
buy-backs and refinancing. In the DAC database, 
debt forgiveness is reported as a grant and 
therefore counts as ODA.

Country programmable aid: defined by subtracting 
from total gross ODA aid that:

 ■ is unpredictable by nature (humanitarian aid 

and debt relief);

 ■ entails no cross-border flows (administrative 

costs, imputed student costs, and costs 
related to promotion of development 
awareness, research in donor countries);

397

AID TABLESIntroductionCommitments and disbursements: A commitment 
is a firm obligation by a donor, expressed in 
writing and backed by necessary funds to 
provide specified assistance to a country or a 
multilateral organization. Disbursements record 
the actual international transfer of financial 
resources or of goods and services. Starting 
with the 2011 Report, disbursement figures are 
used in the text and tables, while in previous 
years commitments were reported. As the aid 
committed in a given year can be disbursed 
later, sometimes over several years, the annual 
aid figures based on commitments cannot be 
directly compared to disbursements. Reliable 
figures on aid disbursements have only been 
available since 2002, which consequently is used 
as the base year.

Current and constant prices: aid figures in the 
DAC databases are expressed in US dollars. 
When comparing aid figures between years, 
adjustment is required to compensate for 
inflation and changes in exchange rates. Such 
adjustments result in aid being expressed in 
constant dollars, i.e. in dollars fixed at the value 
they held in  a given reference year, including 
their external value in terms of other currencies. 
This Report presents most aid data in constant 
2012 US dollars.

Source: OECD-DAC, 2014.

 ■ is not part of cooperation agreements 

between governments (food aid and aid  
from local governments);

 ■ is not country programmable by donor  

(core funding of NGOs).

Country programmable aid is not included  
in the aid tables, but is used in a few places  
in the Report.

Education aid

Direct aid to education: aid to education reported 
in the CRS database as direct allocations to the 
education sector. It is the total of direct aid, as 
defined by the DAC, to:

 ■ basic education, defined by the DAC as 
covering primary education, basic life  
skills for youth and adults, and early 
childhood education;

 ■ secondary education, both general secondary 

education and vocational training;

 ■ post-secondary education, including advanced 

technical and managerial training; 

 ■ education, ‘level unspecified’, which refers to 

any activity that cannot be attributed solely 
to the development of a particular level 
of education, such as education research 
and teacher training. General education 
programme support is often reported within 
this subcategory.

Total aid to education: direct aid to education plus 
20% of general budget support (aid provided 
to governments without being earmarked for 
specific projects or sectors) to represent the 
estimated 15% to 25% of budget support that 
typically benefits the education sector.

Total aid to basic education: direct aid to basic 
education, plus 10% of general budget support, 
plus 50% of education, ‘level unspecified’.

Source: OECD-DAC CRS database (2014).

* Aid disbursement figures for 2002-03 refers to the former Sudan, before the separation 
of the South in 2011. Aid disbursements for 2011 onwards have been separated out by 
the OECD and refer to Sudan and South Sudan

Malta and Slovenia are not listed in the table because they were removed from the 
OECD-DAC list of ODA recipients in 2005. However the aid they received in 2002-2003 
is included in the totals.

The classification by income is based on the World Bank list as of July 2013.

**As defined on the OECD-DAC list of ODA recipients

All data represent gross disbursements.

( . . .  ) indicates that data are not available, (-) represents a nil value

The share of education in total ODA does not match that in Table 2 because the DAC 
database is used for donors and the CRS database for recipients in total ODA figures.

AID TABLESGlossary 

Adjusted net enrolment ratio (ANER). Enrolment 

of the official age group for a given level of 
education either at that level or the levels 
above, expressed as a percentage of the 
population in that age group.

Adult literacy rate. Number of literate persons 

aged 15 and above, expressed as a percentage 
of the total population in that age group.

Age-specific enrolment ratio (ASER). Enrolment 
of a given age or age group, regardless of the 
level of education in which pupils or students 
are enrolled, expressed as a percentage of the 
population of the same age or age group.

Attainment rate by level. Percentage of children 
aged three to five years older than the official 
age of entry into the last grade of an education 
level who have reached the last grade of that 
level. For example, the primary attainment 
rate in a country with a 6-year cycle where 
the official age of entry into the last grade is 
11 years is the percentage of 14 -16 year olds 
who have reached grade 6. 

Child or under-5 mortality rate. Probability of 
dying between birth and the fifth birthday, 
expressed per 1,000 live births.

Conflict affected country. For a given year, any 

country with 1,000 or more battle-related 
deaths (including fatalities among civilians 
and military actors) over the preceding 10-year 
period and/or more than 200 battle-related 
deaths in any one year over the preceding 
3-year period, according to the Uppsala Conflict 
Data Program Battle-Related Deaths Dataset. 

Constant prices. Prices of a particular item 

adjusted to remove the overall effect of 
general price changes (inflation) since a  
given baseline year.

Dropout rate by grade. Percentage of students who 

drop out of a given grade in a given school year.

physical development – from birth to entry into 
primary school.

EFA Development Index (EDI). Composite index 
aimed at measuring overall progress towards 
EFA. At present, the EDI incorporates four 
of the most easily quantifiable EFA goals – 
universal primary education as measured 
by the primary adjusted net enrolment ratio; 
adult literacy as measured by the adult 
literacy rate; gender parity as measured by 
the gender-specific EFA index; and quality of 
education as measured by the survival rate to 
grade 5. Its value is the arithmetic mean of the 
observed values of these four indicators.

Expected cohort completion rate. Percentage of 

children of official primary school entrance 
age who are expected to enter and complete 
primary education. It is calculated as the 
product of two components: the probability 
of a child of official primary entrance age 
entering primary education on time or late 
(expected net intake rate); and the probability 
of a child who has entered primary education 
completing that level of education (cohort 
completion rate).

Gender parity index (GPI). Ratio of female to male 
values of a given indicator. A GPI between 0.97 
and 1.03 indicates parity between the genders. 
A GPI below 0.97 indicates a disparity in favour 
of males. A GPI above 1.03 indicates a disparity 
in favour of females.

Gross domestic product (GDP). The value of all 

final goods and services produced in a country 
in one year (see also Gross national product).

Gross enrolment ratio (GER). Total enrolment in 
a specific level of education, regardless of age, 
expressed as a percentage of the population 
in the official age group corresponding to 
this level of education. The GER can exceed 
100% because of early or late entry and/or 
grade repetition.

Early childhood care and education (ECCE). 

Services and programmes that support 
children’s survival, growth, development and 
learning – including health, nutrition and 
hygiene, and cognitive, social, emotional and 

Gross intake rate (GIR). Total number of 

new entrants to a given grade of primary 
education, regardless of age, expressed as 
a percentage of the population at the official 
school entrance age for that grade.

408

ANNEX1Education for All Global Monitoring Report025Gross national income (GNI). The value of all final 

goods and services produced in a country in 
one year (gross domestic product) plus income 
that residents have received from abroad, 
minus income claimed by non-residents.

Gross national product (GNP). Former 

denomination of gross national income.

Infant mortality rate. Probability of dying between 

birth and the first birthday, expressed as 
deaths per 1,000 live births.

International Standard Classification of 

Education (ISCED). Classification system 
designed to serve as an instrument for 
assembling, compiling and presenting 
comparable indicators and statistics 
of education both within countries and 
internationally. The system, introduced in 
1976, was revised in 1997 and 2011.

Literacy. According to UNESCO’s 1958 definition, 

the term refers to the ability of an individual 
to read and write with understanding a simple 
short statement related to his/her everyday 
life. The concept of literacy has since evolved 
to embrace several skill domains, each 
conceived on a scale of different mastery 
levels and serving different purposes.

Net attendance rate (NAR). Number of pupils 
in the official age group for a given level of 
education who attend school at that level, 
expressed as a percentage of the population in 
that age group.

Net enrolment ratio (NER). Enrolment of 

the official age group for a given level of 
education, expressed as a percentage of the 
population in that age group.

Net intake rate (NIR). New entrants to the first 

grade of primary education who are of the 
official primary school entrance age, expressed 
as a percentage of the population of that age.

New entrants. Pupils entering a given level of 
education for the first time; the difference 
between enrolment and repeaters in the first 
grade of the level.

Never been to school rate. Percentage of 

children aged three to five years older than the 
official entrance age into primary education 
who have never been to school. For example, 

in a country where the official entrance age 
is 6 years, the indicator is calculated over the 
age group 9 to 11 years.

Out-of-school adolescents. Those of lower 

secondary school age who are not enrolled in 
either primary or secondary school.

Out-of-school children. Children in the official 

primary school age range who are not enrolled 
in either primary or secondary school.

Pre-primary education (ISCED level 0). 

Programmes at the initial stage of organized 
instruction, primarily designed to introduce 
very young children, aged at least 3 years, to a 
school-type environment and provide a bridge 
between home and school. Variously referred 
to as infant education, nursery education, 
pre-school education, kindergarten or early 
childhood education, such programmes 
are the more formal component of ECCE. 
Upon completion of these programmes, 
children continue their education at ISCED 1 
(primary education).

Primary cohort completion rate. Proxy measure 

of primary school completion. It focuses 
on children who have access to school, 
measuring how many successfully complete 
it. The primary cohort completion rate is the 
product of the survival rate to the last grade 
and the percentage of those in the last grade 
who successfully graduate.

Primary education (ISCED level 1). Programmes 

generally designed to give pupils a 
sound basic education in reading, writing 
and mathematics, and an elementary 
understanding of subjects such as history, 
geography, natural sciences, social sciences, 
art and music.

Private institutions. Institutions that are not 

operated by public authorities but are controlled 
and managed, whether for profit or not, by 
private bodies such as non-governmental 
organizations, religious bodies, special interest 
groups, foundations or business enterprises.

Public expenditure on education. Total current 

and capital expenditure on education by local, 
regional and national governments, including 
municipalities. Household contributions are 
excluded. The term covers public expenditure 
for both public and private institutions.

409

GLOSSARYPupil/teacher ratio (PTR). Average number 

of pupils per teacher at a specific level 
of education.

Purchasing power parity (PPP). An exchange rate 
adjustment that accounts for price differences 
between countries, allowing international 
comparisons of real output and income.

Quintile. In statistics, one of five equal groups 

into which a population can be divided 
according to the distribution of values of 
a variable. In the GMR, the poorest and 
richest quintiles refer to the distribution 
of household assets reported in nationally 
representative surveys, including such things 
as a refrigerator, indoor toilet, and heating. 
Children from the poorest quintile in each 
country are the 20% with the fewest assets, 
while children from the richest quintile are the 
20% with the most assets.

Repetition rate by grade. Number of repeaters in 
a given grade in a given school year, expressed 
as a percentage of enrolment in that grade the 
previous school year.

School age population. Population of the age 

group officially corresponding to a given level 
of education, whether enrolled in school or not.

School life expectancy (SLE). Number of years 

a child of school entrance age is expected 
to spend in school or university, including 
years spent on repetition. It is the sum of the 
age-specific enrolment ratios for primary, 
secondary, post-secondary non-tertiary and 
tertiary education. A school life expectancy 
can be calculated for each level of education, 
including pre-primary education.

Secondary education (ISCED levels 2 and 3). 

Programme made up of two stages: lower and 
upper secondary. Lower secondary education 
(ISCED 2) is generally designed to continue 
the basic programmes of the primary level 
but the teaching is typically more subject- 
focused, requiring more specialized teachers 
for each subject area. The end of this level 
often coincides with the end of compulsory 
education. In upper secondary education (ISCED 
3), the final stage of secondary education in 
most countries, instruction is often organized 
even more along subject lines and teachers 
typically need a higher or more subject-specific 
qualification than at ISCED level 2.

Skills. Non-innate capabilities that can be 

learned and transmitted, and have economic 
or social benefits both to individuals and 
their societies.

Stunting rate. Proportion of children in a given 

age group whose height for their age is 
between two and three standard deviations 
(moderate stunting) or three or more standard 
deviations (severe stunting) below the 
reference median established by the National 
Center for Health Statistics and the World 
Health Organization. Low height for age is a 
basic indicator of malnutrition.

Survival rate by grade. Percentage of a cohort of 

students who are enrolled in the first grade 
of an education cycle in a given school year 
and are expected to reach a specified grade, 
regardless of repetition.

Technical and vocational education and training 

(TVET). Programmes designed mainly to 
prepare students for direct entry into a 
particular occupation or trade (or class of 
occupations or trades).

Tertiary or higher education (ISCED levels 5 
and 6). Programmes with an educational 
content more advanced than what is offered at 
ISCED levels 3 and 4. The first stage of tertiary 
education, ISCED level 5, includes level 5A, 
composed of largely theoretically based 
programmes intended to provide sufficient 
qualifications for gaining entry to advanced 
research programmes and professions with 
high skill requirements; and level 5B, where 
programmes are generally more practical, 
technical and/or occupationally specific. The 
second stage of tertiary education, ISCED 
level 6, comprises programmes devoted 
to advanced study and original research, 
and leading to the award of an advanced 
research qualification.

Transition rate to secondary education. New 

entrants to the first grade of secondary 
education in a given year, expressed as a 
percentage of the number of pupils enrolled 
in the final grade of primary education in 
the previous year. The indicator measures 
transition to secondary general education only.

Youth literacy rate. Number of literate persons 
aged 15 to 24, expressed as a percentage of 
the total population in that age group.

REFERENCESIndex

Note: This index covers the Overview and 
Chapters 1 to 9. It is in word-by-word order 
which takes account of spaces, so ‘teacher 
training’ comes before ‘teachers’’. Page 
numbers in italics indicate figures and 
tables; those in bold refer to material in 
boxes and panels; bold italics indicates a 
figure or table in a box or panel. The letter 
‘n’ following a page number indicates 
information in a note.

Subheadings are arranged alphabetically 
by the significant term, ignoring 
prepositions and insignificant words (e.g. 
‘effect on achievement’ is alphabetized as 
‘achievement’).

Definitions of terms can be found in the 
glossary, and additional information on 
countries can be found in the aid tables and

INDEXEDUCATION FOR ALL 2000-2015:
achievements and challenges

The twelfth edition of the EFA Global Monitoring Report – marking the 2015 deadline for the six 
goals set at the World Education Forum in Dakar, Senegal, in 2000 – provides a considered and 
comprehensive accounting of global progress. As the international community prepares for a  
new development and education agenda, this report takes stock of past achievements and 
reflects on future challenges.

There are many signs of notable advances. The pace towards universal primary education 
has quickened, gender disparity has been reduced in many countries and governments are 
increasing their focus on making sure children receive an education of good quality. However, 
despite these efforts, the world failed to meet its overall commitment to Education for All. 
Millions of children and adolescents are still out of school, and it is the poorest and most 
disadvantaged who bear the brunt of this failure to reach the EFA targets.

Education for All 2000–2015: Achievements and Challenges provides a comprehensive assessment 
of country progress towards the EFA goals and highlights the work that remains. It highlights 
effective policies and makes recommendations for monitoring and evaluating education targets 
after 2015. It also provides policy-makers with an authoritative source with which to advocate 
that education be a cornerstone of the post-2015 global development architecture.

The EFA Global Monitoring Report is an editorially independent, evidence-based publication that 
serves as an indispensable tool for governments, researchers, education and development 
specialists, media and students. It has assessed education progress in some 200 countries 
and territories on an almost annual basis since 2002. This work will continue, throughout the 
implementation of the post-2015 sustainable development agenda, as the Global Education 
Monitoring Report.

One of the major reforms since 2000 is the 
policy where every child must go to school.  
This has assisted every person to taste the 
fruits of education. It may have robbed the 
farmers of their labour force, but it has given 
them the seeds for a better life in the future.

– Sonam, teacher in Bhutan

Parents that have faced the hardships of not 
being able to write letters, use mobile phones 
or ATMs do all they can to provide their children 
with an education so they don’t ever become 
excluded due to illiteracy.

– Omovigho Rani Ebireri,  
University of Maiduguri, Nigeria

I left because of the things that were happening, 
with the rebels. They destroyed our school, we 
couldn’t go any more. They didn’t like the way 
some of the girls were dressed. They yelled at 
us, saying that what we were wearing wasn’t 
good. They broke our school desks, destroyed 
our school books and our things. School is 
supposed to be a place where we learn things.

– Sita, student in Nigeria

Every child under 5 has to attend pre-school. 
Early childhood education is a major priority.

– Martha Isabel Castano,  
Primary school teacher, Colombia
