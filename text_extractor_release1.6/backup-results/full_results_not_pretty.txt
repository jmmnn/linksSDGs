 rising  sea  levels  could  displace  more \nthan 14 million Egyptians as increased sali-\nnization of the Nile reduces the irrigated land \navailable for agriculture.141\n\nThe United Nations

Outlook 2008 estimates urban energy related CO2 \nemissions at 19.8 Gt, or 71 % of the global total for the year 2006 (IEA, \n2008).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']This corresponds to 330 EJ of primary energy, of which urban \nfinal energy use is estimated to be at 222 EJ.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The Global Energy Assess-\nment provides a range of final urban energy use between 180 and 250 \nEJ with a central estimate of 240 EJ for the year 2005.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']This is equivalent \nto an urban share between 56 % and 78 % (central estimate, 76 %) of \nglobal final energy use.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Converting the GEA estimates on urban final \nenergy (Grubler et\xa0al., 2012) into CO2 emissions (see Methodology and \nMetrics Annex) results in global urban energy related CO2 emissions of \n8.8 \u2014 14.3 Gt (central estimate, 12.5Gt) which is between 53 % and \n87 % (central estimate, 76 %) of CO2 emissions from global final energy \nuse and between 30 % and 56 % (central estimate, 43 %) of global pri-\nmary energy related CO2 emissions (CO2 includes flaring and cement \nemissions  which  are  small).", u"['SDG_11', 'SDG_12']Estimates are \nprovided in ranges where the lower end provides an estimate of the \ndirect  emissions  from  urban  areas  only  and  the  higher  end  provides \nan estimate that assigns all emissions from electricity consumption to \nthe consuming (urban) areas.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The  estimated  urban  share  of  energy  related  CO2  emissions  in  2000 \nis slightly lower than the GEA and IEA estimate, at 72 % using Scope \n2  accounting  and  44 %  using  Scope  1  accounting  (see  Figure  12.4).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The  urban  GHG  emissions  (CO2,  N2O,  CH4,  and  SF6)  from  the  energy \nshare of total energy GHGs is between 42 % and 66 %.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_12']Hence, while \nthe sparse evidence available suggests that urban areas dominate final \nenergy consumption and associated CO2 emissions, the contribution to \ntotal global GHG emissions may be more modest as the large majority \nof CO2 emissions from land-use change, N2O emissions, and CH4 emis-\nsions take place outside urban areas.",

for primary energy), 80 % for the United States (85 % for primary \nenergy, see also (Parshall et\xa0al., 2010), and 86 % for China (75 % for \nprimary energy, see also Dhakal, 2009).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']For example, while Africa tends \nto  have  a  high  urban  CO2  emissions  share  (64 % \u2013 74 %)  in  terms  of \nenergy related CO2 emissions, the overall contribution of urban areas \nacross all sectors and gases is estimated to range between 21 % and \n30 % of all emissions (Marcotullio et\xa0al., 2013).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_13']In many cases, a large part of the

'SDG_12']Socio-demographic drivers of urban GHG emissions include popula-\ntion  structure  and  dynamics  (e. g.,  population  size,  age  distribution, \nand household characteristics) (O\u2019Neill et\xa0al., 2010) as well as cultural \nnorms (e. g., consumption and lifestyle choices) and distributional and \nequity  factors  (e. g.,  access  or  lack  thereof  to  basic  urban  infrastruc-\nture).", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']a growth accounting framework and does not lend itself to explaining \ndifferences between urban settlements in terms of absolute GHG emis-\nsion levels and their driving forces (see discussion below).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_11']Although \nthe relative contribution of different drivers of emissions varies across \ncities and time periods, one study of several Chinese cities found that \nincome is the most important driver of increases in urban carbon emis-\nsions, far surpassing population growth, with improvements in energy \nefficiency  serving  as  a  critical  counterbalancing  factor  to  income \n\ngrowth (Dhakal, 2009).", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']The importance of economic growth as a driver \nof urban CO2 emissions in China has been consistently corroborated in \nother studies, including those that examine relatively smaller cities and \nwith the use of alternative types of data and methods (Li et\xa0al., 2010; \nLiu et\xa0al., 2012; Chong et\xa0al., 2012; Jiang and Lin, 2012).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The literature on drivers of urban GHG emissions in other non-Annex\xa0I \ncountries is more sparse, often focusing on emission drivers at the sec-\ntoral level such as transport (Mraihi et\xa0al., 2013) or household energy \nuse (Ekholm et\xa0al., 2010).", u"['SDG_11', 'SDG_12']The lat-\nter two studies are of particular interest as they provide an in-depth \nanalysis  of  the  determining  variables  of  urban  GHG  emissions  using \nboth  production  and  consumption-based  accounting  approaches.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']It is difficult to isolate the individual impact of any of \nthese factors on urban energy use and GHG emissions since they are \nlinked and often interact across different spatial and temporal scales.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']For instance, a study of 225 cities \nsuggests  a  robust  negative  correlation  between  per  capita  income \nlevels and energy intensity (Grubler et\xa0al., 2012) that holds for both \nhigh-income  as  well  as  low-income  cities.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_9', 'SDG_11']12\ufffd3\ufffd1\ufffd3  Human settlements, linkages to sectors, and

'SDG_9', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_15']The drivers also affect the demand for urban energy, water, and \nwaste infrastructure systems, whose GHG emissions can be mitigated \nvia  technological  improvements  within  each  individual  infrastructure \nsystem (e. g., methane recovery from municipal wastewater treatment \nplants and landfills) as well as through improved system integration \n(e. g., using urban waste as an energy source).", u"['SDG_11', 'SDG_16']On one hand, governance and institutions for addressing mitigation \noptions  at  the  urban  scale  are  more  dispersed  (see  12.6)  and  face \na legacy of inadequately addressing a range of market failures (see \nBox 12.3).", u"['SDG_9', 'SDG_11']On the other hand, the urban scale also provides unique \nopportunities for policy integration between urban form and density, \ninfrastructure planning, and demand management options.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']In so far as the bulk of urban growth momentum is \nexpected  to  unfold  in  small-  to  medium-size  cities  in  non-Annex\xa0 I \ncountries (see Section 12.2), mitigation of GHG emissions at the scale \nof  human  settlements  faces  a  new  type  of  \u2018governance  paradox\u2019 \n(Grubler  et\xa0 al.,  2012):  the  largest  opportunities  for  GHG  emission \nreduction (or avoidance of unfettered emission growth) might be pre-\ncisely in urban areas where governance and institutional capacities \nto  address  them  are  weakest  (Br\xe4utigam  and  Knack,  2004;  Rodrik \net\xa0al., 2004).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']studies of urban scaling, few studies explicitly examine city size and \nGHG emissions or energy use, and the limited empirical evidence on \nthe scaling relationship is inconclusive.", u"['SDG_9', 'SDG_11']With the scale of urbanization trends currently underway, whether the \nrelationship between city size and GHG emissions is linear (i. e., one to \none, or proportional increase), super-linear (i. e., increasing returns to \nscale) or sub-linear (i. e., economies of scale such as efficiency gains \nthrough shared infrastructure) will be critical for understanding future \nurban GHG emissions.", u"['SDG_9', 'SDG_11']Super-linear scaling has been observed for many \nurban phenomena: as a city\u2019s population increases, there is a greater \nthan one to one increase in productivity, wages, and innovation as well \nas  crime  (Bettencourt  et\xa0 al.,  2007,  2010).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']If  cities  exhibit  sub-linear \nscaling with respective to energy and GHG emissions, it suggests that \nlarger cities are more

\ufb02exibil-ity in service standards such as lifeline rates,and so on.When there is no choice ofproviders,increasing poor people\u2019s participation in ser-vice provision\u2014giving them the ability tomonitor and discipline the provider,forexample\u2014can achieve similar results.Clientscan play the role ofmonitors since they arepresent at the point ofservice.But they needto have an incentive to monitor.In Bangladesh,thanks to reduced importtariffs,households were able to purchasetubewells that tapped ground sources\u2014shal-low aquifers\u2014for drinking water.Unfortu-nately,no

aid\u2014aproject\u2014is often implemented by a separateunit outside the compact,bypassing the rela-tionship between policymakers and pro-viders.The project is typically \ufb01nanced byearmarked funds subject to donor-mandated\ufb01duciary requirements.It and other donorinitiatives,including global \u201cfunds,\u201dbypassthe citizen-policymaker relationship wherethe budget is concerned.To be sure,when theexisting relationship is dysfunctional,it maybe necessary to go around it.But the caseswhere the bene\ufb01ts outweigh the costs areprobably fewer than imagined.Recognizing the gap between ends andmeans,some donors and recipients try to useforeign aid to strengthen,not weaken,thelinks in the service delivery chain.Oneapproach is to incorporate donor assistancein the recipient\u2019s budget,shifting to the recip-ient\u2019s accountability system.In Uganda assis-tance from Germany,Ireland,the Nether-lands,Norway,United Kingdom,and theWorld Bank is all part ofthe country\u2019s bud-get,the outcome ofa coordinated and partic-ipatory process.Another approach is for donors to pooltheir assistance in a single \u201cpot\u201dand to har-monize their \ufb01duciary standards around thatofthe rest ofthe government.The sectorwideapproach to health,education,transport,andother sectors is a step in this direction.Possi-bly the biggest payoffcomes when donorshelp generate knowledge\u2014as when donor-\ufb01nanced impact evaluation studies revealwhat works and what doesn\u2019t in service deliv-ery,or when donors pool technical assistanceresources at the retail level,as in the multi-donor Water and Sanitation Program.Knowledge is essential to scaling up servicedelivery.Although it emerges locally,it is aglobal public good\u2014precisely what aid isdesigned

sensitive to the allocation of powerwithin households:families in which the bar-gaining power of women is stronger tend toinvest more in health and education.A studyin Brazil found that demand for calories andprotein was up to 10 times more responsiveto women\u2019s than men\u2019s income.This result,strongest in societies that proscribe women\u2019sroles,tends to affect girls more than boys.More generally,the roles and responsibili-ties of different household members canaffect how investments are made.A womanin Egypt says:\u201cWe face a calamity when myhusband falls ill.Our life comes to a halt untilhe recovers.\u201dHer husband\u2019s earnings are cru-cial for sustaining the family.Since productiv-ity is related to illness,households respond.In Bangladesh a study found that householdmembers who engaged in more strenuousactivities received more nutritious food.Daughters\u2019education might be less valuableto parents if sons typically look after them intheir old age,so parents might be less willingto send girls to school.Demand:links between sectors atindividual and household levelsHealth and nutritional status directly affectsa child\u2019s probability of school enrollment andcapacity to learn and succeed in school.Mal-nutrition among children was associatedwith signi\ufb01cant delays in school enrollmentin Ghana.Improving child health and nutri-tion at the pre-primary level has long-termimpacts on development.A study in thePhilippines found that a one-standard-devia-tion increase in early-age child healthincreased subsequent test scores by about athird of a standard deviation.Improving the health and nutritional sta-tus of students positively affects schoolenrollment and attendance.A longitudinalstudy in Pakistan found that a one-third of astandard deviation increase in child heightincreased school enrollment by 19 percent-age points for girls and 4 percentage pointsfor boys.An evaluation of school-based masstreatment for deworming in rural Kenyafound that student absenteeism fell by aquarter\u2014but test scores did not appear tobe affected.Improving nutrition is not as sim-ple as supplementary feeding at school:households can reallocate resources with theeffect of \u201csharing\u201dthat food.A study in thePhilippines found no such sharing in general,but for a school snack program there wassharing in poorer families.Parents\u2019education has intergenerationaleffects on the health,nutritional status,andschooling of their children.Adult female edu-cation is one of the most robust correlates ofchild mortality in cross-national studies,evencontrolling for national income.Similarly,mother\u2019s education is a strong determinantof lower mortality at the household level,though the relationship weakens when otherhousehold and community socioeconomiccharacteristics are controlled for.A large partof this effect might not be general educationbut speci\ufb01c health knowledge,perhapsacquired using literacy and numeracy skillslearned in school,as a study in Moroccofound.The effects can also be interspatial:astudy in Peru found that the education of amother\u2019s neighbors signi\ufb01cantly increasesthe nutritional status of her children.Parents\u2019education is similarly associated with theschooling of their children,though the mag-nitude of the effect\u2014and the relative roles ofmother\u2019s and father\u2019s education\u2014vary sub-stantially across countries.Access to\u2014and use of\u2014safe water,aswell as adequate sanitation,have directeffects on health status.Hand washing is apowerful health practice,but it requires suf\ufb01-cient quantities of water.An eight-countrystudy found that going from no improvedwater to \u201coptimal\u201dwater was associated witha 6-percentage-point reduction in the preva-lence of diarrhea in children under threeyears of age (from a base of 25 percent) inhouseholds without sanitation.Nutritionalstatus was likewise associated with access toimproved water.But not all studies \ufb01ndstrong associations between water sourceand better health.The water source is only part of the story:in Bangladesh water accessed through tube-wells\u2014an \u201cimproved\u201dsource\u2014 is frequentlycontaminated with arsenic.One study foundthat arsenic levels higher than the WorldHealth Organization\u2019s maximum acceptablelevel are associated with twice the level ofdiarrhea in children under age six.Extremelyhigh levels of arsenic are associated withshorter stature among adolescents.The same eight-country study mentionedabove found that going to \u201coptimal\u201dsanitation from none was associated with a10-percentage-point drop in recent diarrheain households with no improved watersource.As in education,there are spillovereffects:sanitation practices at the communitylevel impact everyone\u2019s health.In Peru thesanitation investments of a family\u2019s neighborswere associated with better nutritional statusfor that family\u2019s children.The use of safe energy sourcesaffectsboth health and education.Indoor air pollu-tion\u2014from using dirty cooking and heatingfuels\u2014hurts child health.One review ofstudies found that the probability of respi-ratory illness,or even death,was betweentwo and \ufb01ve times higher in houses whereexposure to indoor air pollution was high.Astudy in Guatemala found birth weights 65grams lower among newborns of womenwho used wood as a domestic cooking fuel.Coping with the cold,in cold climates,affects health and imposes substantialdirect and indirect costs on households.Education is affected as well:schools haveto close when there is not enough heat,andit is hard to imagine that working onschoolwork at home is an option whenindoor temperatures are below freezing.Supply:global developmentsAt any given income,health and educationoutcomes have been improving.A continu-ing trend in improvements in health goingback several decades is interpreted asadvances in technologies and leaps inknowledge about health and hygiene.Morerecently,at a national income of $600 percapita,predicted child mortality fell from100 per 1,000 births to 80\u2014a full 20percent reduction\u2014between 1990 and2000.If this association were sustained,major headway would be made toward theMillennium Development Goal throughthese changes alone.Major breakthroughsin immunizations for malaria\u2014or HIV\u2014could have a huge impact on mortality atall income levels.Recent years have seen major develop-ments in global funding for health and edu-cation expenditures.Debt relief through theHeavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative istied to increases in expenditures on thesesectors.New assistance,delivered throughmultisectoral products such as PovertyReduction Support Credits,requires explicitstrategies for human developmentinvestments.Global funds for health and the\u201cFast-Track Initiative\u201dfor education are inter-national pledges to support initiatives in thesectors (chapter 11).Easing \ufb01nancialconstraints goes hand in hand with usingresources effectively to support services thatwork for poor people.CRATE 1.1Determinants ofhealth and education outcomes\u2014within,outside,and across sectors (continued)03_WDR_Ch01.qxd  8/14/03  7:37 AM  Page 28\x0c(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank\n\nServices can work for poor people but too often they fail29Supply:national resourcesNational income is strongly associated withchild mortality and primary school comple-tion.Income and health and education out-comes build on each other.More incomeleads to better human developmentoutcomes,and better health and educationcan lead to increased productivity and betterincomes.Studies that have tried to disentan-gle these relationships typically \ufb01nd incometo be a robust and strong determinant ofoutcomes.National endowments are also a strongdeterminant.Geography and climate some-times make it tougher to overcome healthproblems.For example,areas conducive tomosquito survival have great dif\ufb01culty in com-bating malaria\u2014and widely dispersed popu-lations are dif\ufb01cult to serve throughtraditional school systems.The performance of public expenditure inproducing outcomes varies substantially acrosscountries.There are large differences inachievements at similar levels of expenditureand similar achievements with very large differ-ences in expenditures\u2014conditional on income.Spending more through the public sector is notalways associated with improved outcomes.This is not to say that spending cannot be help-ful\u2014but the way resources are used is crucialto their effectiveness.Supply:political,economic,and policy contextGovernance affects the ef\ufb01ciency of expendi-tures:in corrupt settings money that is osten-sibly earmarked for improving human devel-opment outcomes is diverted.Staffsostensibly delivering services do not.But theeffects of poor governance can be deeper.Famines are caused as much by human fac-tors as by nature.And the repercussions runacross national borders.For example,adrought combined with misguided policiesand bad governance in Zimbabwe resultedin a regional food shortage.Managing public expenditures can be acritical link in ensuring that allocated expen-ditures get put to uses that improveoutcomes.\u201cCash budgeting\u201din Zambia led tounpredictable social service spending anddeep cuts in spending on rural infrastructure.Con\ufb02ict leaves long-lived scars on healthand education.Children in war-torn countriesare hard to \ufb01nd,hard to get into school,andhard to keep in school.During Sierra Leone\u2019srecent civil war,tens of thousands of childrenattended primary school but hundreds ofthousands did not.Wars,including civil wars,lead to \u201clost generations\u201dof undernourishedand undereducated children.These de\ufb01cien-cies are dif\ufb01cult\u2014if not impossible\u2014to makeup for.When children have been out ofschool for a long time,it is hard to return.And bad health and poor nutrition at an earlyage affect children throughout their lives.Periods of national economic and socialcrisis can result in bad health and educationoutcomes.This is clear in Russia\u2019s recent his-tory:adult mortality has increased dramati-cally over the past 10 years.Sustainedeconomic depression can severely compro-mise children\u2019s health and have cascadingeffects on subsequent development andlearning.The evidence of shorter-term eco-nomic crises is more mixed.In middle-income environments school enrollmentsmight increase as the opportunity cost oftime for young people falls.Even in Indone-sia,a relatively poor country,the deepeconomic and social crisis of the late 1990shad smaller impacts on outcomes than ini-tially feared.This was partly because broadsocial safety nets were rapidly put in place.Supply:the local context of governmentand communitiesDecentralization can be a powerful tool formoving decisionmaking closer to thoseaffected by it.Doing so can strengthen thelinks and accountability between policymak-ers and citizens\u2014local governments arepotentially more accountable to localdemands.It can also strengthen thembetween policymakers and providers\u2014localgovernments are potentially more able tomonitor providers.But local governmentsshould not be romanticized.Like nationalgovernments they are vulnerable tocapture\u2014and this might be easier for localelites on a local scale.Community-level institutions,shaped bycultural norms and practices,can facilitateor hinder an environment for improvingoutcomes.A review of safe-water projects inCentral Java,Indonesia,associates successwith greater social capital.In Rajasthan,India,manifestations of \u201cmutually bene\ufb01cialcollective action\u201dwere associated withwatershed conservation and developmentactivities more generally.A broader reviewof the literature suggests that participatoryapproaches to implementing projects aremore successful in communities with lesseconomic inequality and less social and eth-nic heterogeneity.Supply:services and their \ufb01nancingServices themselves are important.Inacces-sible or poor-quality services raise theeffective price of health care and schooling,which results in higher mortality and lowereducational achievement.Poor-qualityschools deter enrollment and reduceattainment and achievement,especiallyamong children of poor families.Healthclinics where the technical skills of staff areso bad as to be dangerous will lead tohigher mortality.Lack of water will signi\ufb01-cantly hurt child health.Financing arrangements matter.Absorb-ing the burden of unpredictable large expen-ditures through health insurance can reduceimpoverishment,which in turn will affectoutcomes.Financing primary schoolingmight seem relatively minor:direct costs aretypically small.Even so,a lack of access tocredit has been found to be associated withlower school enrollment.Borrowing to paythe direct costs of primary school is almostunheard of,but there could be second-roundeffects if the lack of access to credit meansthat families need children to engage inhome production.Supply:services working together toproduce outcomesLinks among services are critical.Vaccinescan become less effective,ineffective,oreven dangerous if they get too hot,freeze,or are exposed to light.The ability to trans-port and store vaccines properly thusdetermines the success of immunizationcampaigns.In cold climates schools andhealth facilities often need to close becauseof the lack of heating,and dependableenergy sources can directly affect healthand education outcomes.The accessibilityof services can be a deterrent to their use:roads and adequate transport contribute tothe total cost of using a service.Since theexpected return to education determinesthe bene\ufb01ts of schooling,labor marketsthat are not fundamentally distorted (forexample,through discriminatory practicestoward marginalized groups) cancontribute to higher educationachievement.Services therefore need towork together to promote improvedoutcomes.Source:Sources are detailed in Filmer (2003a).CRATE 1.1Determinants ofhealth and education

President Vincente Fox was elect-ed,his government embraced the program,built on it using the evaluation results,expanded it to urban areas,and renamed itOportunidades.By the end of2002 the pro-gram had about 21 million bene\ufb01ciaries\u2014roughly a \ufb01fth ofthe Mexican population.Designing a comprehensiveprogramChildren over seven were eligible for educa-tion transfers.Bene\ufb01ts increased by grade(since opportunity costs increase with age)and were higher for girls in middle school,to encourage their enrollment.To retain thebene\ufb01ts,children needed to maintain an 85percent attendance record and could notrepeat a grade more than once.Eligible families could also receive amonthly stipend ifmembers got regular med-ical checkups and mothers attended monthlynutrition and hygiene information sessions.Households with children under three couldalso receive a micronutrient supplement.The transfers went to mothers,whowere thought more responsible for caringfor children.The program imposed amonthly ceiling of$75 per family.In 1999the average monthly transfer was around$24 per family,nearly 20 percent ofmeanhousehold consumption before the pro-gram.Transfers were also in\ufb02ation-indexedevery six months (today the maximum is$95 and the average is $35).Highly centralized,the program has justone intermediary between program of\ufb01-cials and bene\ufb01ciaries\u2014a woman commu-nity promoter chosen by a general assemblyofhouseholds in targeted communities.Shecan also liaise between bene\ufb01ciaries andeducation and health providers.By the end of1999 the program coveredsome 2.6 million rural families\u2014about 40percent ofrural families and a ninth ofallfamilies in Mexico.The program budgetwas almost $780 million,or 0.2 percent ofgross domestic product and 20 percent ofthe federal poverty alleviation budget.When Ernesto Zedillo becameMexico\u2019s president in 1995,a\ufb01fth ofthe population couldnot afford the minimum daily nutritionalrequirements,10 million Mexicans lackedaccess to basic health services,more than1.5 million children were out ofschool,and student absenteeism and school deser-tions were three times higher in poor andremote areas than in the rest ofthe coun-try.The country had a history ofunpro-ductive poverty alleviation programs.Worse,the 1994\u201395 economic crisis left thegovernment with even fewer resources\u2014and greater demands,as more people werefalling into poverty.The administration decided that a newapproach to poverty alleviation was need-ed.The Education,Health,and NutritionProgram ofMexico,called Progresa,intro-duced a set ofconditional cash transfers topoor families\u2014iftheir children wereenrolled in school and iffamily membersvisited health clinics for checkups andnutrition and hygiene information.The program was intended to remedyseveral shortcomings ofearlier programs.First,it would counter the bias in poor fam-ilies toward present consumption by bol-stering investment in human capital.Second,it would recognize the interdepen-dencies among education,health,andnutrition.Third,to stretch limitedresources,it would link cash transfers tohousehold behavior,aiming at changingattitudes.Fourth,to reduce political inter-ference,the program\u2019s goals,rules,require-ments,and evaluation methods would bewidely publicized.The program has been rigorously evalu-ated,and evaluators have exploited the ran-domized way the program was rolled out.The results have been impressive.Toemphasize the apolitical nature ofthe pro-gram,the government suspended thegrowth ofthe program for six months priorto the election in 2000\u2014to show thatProgresa was not a political tool.Almost 60 percent ofprogram transferswent to households in the poorest 20 per-cent ofthe national income distribution andmore than 80 percent to the poorest 40 per-cent.This is impressive.The median target-ing effectiveness in 77 safety net programsfrom around the world was to have 65 per-cent ofbene\ufb01ts go to the poorest 40 percent(according to one recent study).Even with careful targeting and moni-toring,the program\u2019s administrative costswere less than 9 percent oftotal costs\u2014sub-stantially lower than earlier poverty allevia-tion efforts in Mexico.Despite its initiallarge scale,the program did not cover allthe poor,particularly in urban areas.Boosting enrollmentsGirls\u2019enrollment in middle school rose from67 percent to around 75 percent,and boys\u2019from 73 percent to 78 percent.Most oftheincrease came from increases in the transi-tion from primary to middle school (\ufb01gure1).The program worked primarily by keep-ing children in school,not by encouragingthose who had dropped out to return.It alsohelped reduce the incidence ofchild labor.Conditional cash transfers to reduce poverty in MexicoProgresa,the Education,Health,and Nutrition Program ofMexico,transferred money directly to families on the condi-tion that family members went for health checkups,mothers went for hygiene and nutrition information sessions,andchildren attended school.By documenting success through rigorous evaluation,the program has improved,scaled up,and taught others.107Progresaspotlight on 0123Grade4567860402080100Post-intervention:ProgresaPercentPost-intervention: Non-ProgresaFigure 1Higher school retention, moretransitions

equilibrium analysis ofProgresa found that the welfare impact was60 percent higher than that ofthe highlydistortionary food subsidies that Mexicoused previously.Evaluating impactsProgresa was unusual in integrating evalua-tion from the beginning,enabling it toassess impacts fairly precisely.To ensurepolitical credibility,the evaluation was con-tracted out to a foreign-based researchgroup,the International Food PolicyResearch Institute.Phasing in communities in a randomfashion\u2014required for budgetary purpos-es\u2014allowed the construction of186 con-trol and 320 treatment groups.Having thecontrol groups enabled evaluators to \u201cwashout\u201dconfounding factors,including timetrends and shocks (economic and climatic).Eventually all control communities wereincorporated in the program.Both quanti-tative and qualitative evaluations were con-ducted,the latter using semistructuredinterviews,focus groups,and workshops.Labor force participation decreased by about20 percent for boys.Still,a substantial num-ber ofchildren from poor families continueto combine work with school.The impacts on learning are less clear.Teachers report improvements,attributingthem to better attendance,student interest,and nutrition.But a study conducted oneyear after the program started found no dif-ference in test scores.Improving nutrition and healthThe program helped reduce the

framework ofactors(individuals,organizations,governments,businesses) and relationships ofaccount-ability that will be used throughout theReport.It describes the characteristics ofservices that make creating those relation-ships so crucial\u2014and so dif\ufb01cult.It uses theframework and the characteristics oftheservices to analyze why pure public sectorproduction often fails\u2014and why pure pri-vatization is not the answer.It lays out howthe various items on the agenda for servicereform are related and how the Report willaddress them.And it addresses the dynam-ics

framework:actors and accountabilitiesLanguage evolves through common usage,so no one is accountable when the wordaccountabilityacquires so many differentuses and meanings.What this Report meansby accountability is a relationship amongactors that has \ufb01ve features:delegation,\ufb01nance,performance,information about per-formance,andenforceability (\ufb01gure 3.1).Relationships ofaccountability can be assimple as buying a sandwich or taking ajob\u2014and as complex as running a munici-pal democracy.\u2022In buying a sandwich you ask for it (del-egation) and pay for it (\ufb01nance).Thesandwich is made for you (performance).You eat the sandwich (which generatesrelevant informationabout its quality).And you then choose to buy or not buy asandwich another day (enforceability),affecting the pro\ufb01ts ofthe seller.\u2022In a typical employment relationship aperson is given a set oftasks (delegation)and paid a wage (\ufb01nance).The employeeworks (performance).The contribution ofthe employee is assessed (information).And based on that information,theemployer acts to reinforce good or dis-courage bad performance (enforceability).\u2022In a city the citizens choose an executiveto manage the tasks ofthe municipality(delegation),including tax and budgetdecisions (\ufb01nance).The executive acts,often in ways that involve the executivein relationships ofaccountability withothers (performance).Voters then assessthe executive\u2019s performance based ontheir experience and information.Andthey act to control the executive\u2014eitherpolitically or legally (enforceability).There are many other vocabularies forreferring to these pervasive and criticalissues from a variety ofdisciplines (eco-nomics,political science,sociology) andpractices (public administration,manage-ment).This Report makes no claims ofcoming up with a superior set ofwords.Theterms here have the virtues ofcompleteness(a name for everything the Report dis-cusses) and consistency (the same namesare used throughout).See box 3.1 for a glos-sary ofterms used in this Report.Forinstance,recent work on the empowermentofpoor people,extending the work ofthe2000/2001 World Development Reportonpoverty,suggests four elements that overlapin important ways with the analysis here:access to information,inclusion and partic-ipation,accountability,and local organiza-tional capacity.162Others use the termaccountabilityto refer only to the dimensionof\u201canswerability\u201d(getting informationabout performance) or to \u201cenforceability.\u201dThis Report uses the term broadly.There are two motivations for thisbroader approach.First,weaknesses in anyaspect ofaccountability can cause failure.One cannot strengthen enforceability\u2014holding providers responsible for outputsand outcomes\u2014in isolation.Ifprovidersdo not receive clear delegation,preciselyspecifying the desired objectives,increas-ing enforceability is unfair and ineffective.Ifproviders are not given adequateresources,holding them accountable forpoor outcomes is again unfair and ineffec-tive.Second,putting \ufb01nance as the \ufb01rststep in creating a relationship ofaccount-ability stresses that simply caring about anoutcome controlled by another does notcreate a relationship ofaccountability.Tobe a \u201cstakeholder\u201dyou need to put up astake.In the chain ofservice delivery the Reportdistinguishes four broad roles:\u2022Citizens/clients.Patients,students,par-ents,voters.\u2022Politicians/policymakers.Prime ministers,presidents,parliamentarians,mayors,ministers of\ufb01nance,health,education.\u2022Organizational providers.Health depart-ments,education departments,waterand sanitation departments.\u2022Frontline professionals.Doctors,nurses,teachers,engineers.In the ideal situation these actors arelinked in relationships ofpower andaccountability.Citizens exercise voice overpoliticians.Policymakers have

terms as accountabilitylose their meaning.This Report,in developing itsservice delivery framework,gives somecommonly used terms (such as accountability)speci\ufb01c meaning and we coin a few new terms.We do not claim we have superior or bettermeanings,but we do try for internal consistency.Accountabilityis a set of relationshipsamong service delivery actors with \ufb01ve features:\u2022Delegating:Explicit or implicit understand-ing that a service (or goods embodying the ser-vice) will be supplied.\u2022Financing.Providing the resources to enablethe service to be provided or paying for it.\u2022Performing.Supplying the actual service.\u2022Having information about performance.Obtaining relevant information and evaluatingperformance against expectations and formal orinformal norms.\u2022Enforcing.Being able to impose sanctions forinappropriate performance or provide rewardswhen performance is appropriate.This Report de\ufb01nes four relationships ofaccountability:client power (over providers),com-pacts,management (by provider organizations offrontline professionals),and voice and politics(between citizens and politicians/policymakers).Actors:Individuals,households,communi-ties,\ufb01rms,governments,and other public,non-governmental,and private organizations that\ufb01nance,produce,regulate,deliver,or consumeservices.In economic theory the actors whohold others accountable are sometimes calledprincipals,and the actors who are held account-able are called agents.Client power:The relationship of account-ability connecting clients to the frontline serviceproviders,usually at the point of service deliv-ery,based on transactions through which clientsexpress their demand for services and can mon-itor supply and providers.Clients/citizens:Service users who as citi-zens participate individually or in groups (e.g.,labor unions) in political processes to shape andattain collective goals.As clients,individualsreceive services to satisfy their householddemand.All clients are citizens (in most settings)but,depending on the service,not all citizensare clients.Clientelism:The tendency of politicians aspatrons to respond to political competition byexcessively favoring one group of clients overanother in return for political advantage (votebanks).Providing narrow supporter groups withfree public services or public employment,par-ticularly where shirking is not sanctioned,isoften the way politicians practice clientelism.Compacts:The broad,long-term relationshipof accountability connecting policymakers toorganizational providers.This is usually not as spe-ci\ufb01c or legally enforceable as a contract.But anexplicit,veri\ufb01able contract can be one form of acompact.Discretionary services:Locally producedservices,such as classroom instruction or cura-tive care,where the teacher or doctor must exer-cise signi\ufb01cant judgment on what to deliver andhow,and where clients typically have a largeinformation de\ufb01cit relative to the provider.Dis-cretionary services that are transaction-intensiveare hard to monitor,both for the client and forthe policymaker,whether publicly or privatelyprovided.They pose particular challenges for allthe relationships of accountability.Frontline professionals:The teachers,nurses,doctors,engineers,clerks,or other providers whocome in direct contact with the client.Long and short routes of accountability:Clients may seek to hold service providersaccountable for performance in two ways.Clientpower connecting clients and providers is thedirect,\u201cshort\u201droute of accountability.When suchclient power is weak or not possible to use,clients must use voice and politics in their roleas citizens to hold politicians accountable\u2014andpolitician/policymakers must in turn use thecompact to do the same with providers.Thecombination of the two is the roundabout,\u201clong\u201droute of accountability.Management:The relationship of account-ability connecting organizational providersand frontline professionals,comprising internalprocesses for public and private organizationsto select,train,motivate,administer,and evalu-ate frontline professionals.These processesmay be rule-bound in large bureaucracies,oridiosyncratic and ad hoc in small,privateproviders.Organizational providers:Public,privatenonpro\ufb01t,and private for-pro\ufb01t entities thatactually provide services.These may range fromgovernment line ministries with hundreds ofthousands of employees to a private hospitalchain or from a vast urban water utility to a sin-gle,community-run,village school.Politicians/policymakers:The service deliv-ery actors authorized by the state to dischargeits legislative,regulatory,and rule-makingresponsibilities.Politicians may be elected orachieve their positions through nondemocraticmeans.They can also be policymakers (the gen-eral who is president but also runs the military,the telecom minister who administers the saleof frequencies).But more commonly policymak-ers are the highest nonelected of\ufb01cials\u2014eitherfrom a civil service or appointed.Politicians setgeneral directions.Policymakers implementthese directions and set and enforce the condi-tions for public and private service providers tooperate.Usually accountability subrelationshipsbetween politicians and policymakers (parodiedin the TV serial \u201cYes Minister\u201d) are derived fromthe constitution,administrative law,or rules ofpublic administration.Service delivery framework (or chain):Thefour service-related actors\u2014citizens/clients,politicians/policymakers,organizationalproviders,frontline professionals\u2014and the fourrelationships of accountabilitythat connectthem:\u2022Voice and politics:connecting citizens andpoliticians.\u2022Compacts:connecting politicians/policy-makers and providers.\u2022Management:connecting provider organiza-tions with frontline professionals.\u2022Client power:connecting clients withproviders.\u2022Short route of accountability:See long andshort routes of accountability.Strategic incrementalism:Pragmatic incre-mental reforms in weak institutionalenvironments that are not likely to fully addressservice delivery problems but can alleviate acuteservice problems while at the same time creat-ing the conditions for deeper and morefavorable change\u2014say,building capacity thatcan respond to service delivery challenges.Thiscan be contrasted with,for lack of a better term,\u201cincremental incrementalism\u201dthat merely solvesone set of immediate problems but creates oth-ers.For example,working around existing gov-ernment and governance structures with nostrategy for how these temporary measures willaffect the long term.Transaction-intensive services:Services thatrequire repeated,frequent client-provider contact.Transaction-intensive services may bediscretionary and require constant,minute deci-sions (classroom teaching),making them very hardto monitor.Or the technology may not requiremuch discretion (\ufb01re and forget) once there isclient contact (immunization).Voice and politics:The most complex rela-tionship of accountability.It connects citizensand politicians and comprises many formal andinformal processes,including voting and elec-toral politics,lobbying and propaganda,patron-age and clientelism,media activities,access toinformation,and so on.Citizens delegate topoliticians the functions of serving their inter-ests and \ufb01nancing governments through theirtaxes.Politicians perform by providing services,such as law and order or communities relativelyfree of pathogens.Citizens enforce accountabil-ity through elections and other less de\ufb01nitivemeans,such as advocacy,legal actions,andnaming and shaming campaigns.BOX 3.1A glossary for this Report07_WDR_Ch03.qxd  8/14/03  7:57 AM  Page 48\x0c(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank\n\nThe framework for service provision49with organizational providers.Organiza-tions manage frontline providers.Andclients exercise client powerthrough inter-actions with frontline providers (\ufb01gure3.2).In low-income countries a \ufb01fth role,played by external \ufb01nance agencies,affectseach ofthese relationships (chapter 11).Weaknesses in anyofthe relationships\u2014or in the capacity ofthe actors\u2014can resultin service failures.Providers can be madedirectly accountable to clients (as in markettransactions) by passing decisions and pow-ers directly to citizens or communities\u2014a\u201cshort route\u201dofaccountability.But,moretypically,the public sector is involved,sotwo key relationships\u2014voice and com-pacts\u2014make up the main control mecha-nism ofthe citizen in a \u201clong route\u201dofaccountability.In either case,organizations(such as health,education,and waterdepartments) need to be able to managefrontline providers.The four actorsCitizens and clients.Individuals andhouseholds have dual roles,as citizens andas direct clients.As citizens they participateboth as individuals and through coalitions(communities,political parties,laborunions,business associations) in politicalprocesses that de\ufb01ne collective objectives;they also strive to control and direct publicaction in accomplishing those objectives.Asdirect clients ofservice providers,individu-als and households hope to get clean water,have their children educated,and protectthe health oftheir family.The role ofcitizens and clients as servicebene\ufb01ciaries does not imply that all citizensare alike or have the same views.Terms suchas civil societyand community are some-times used too casually.People differ inbeliefs,hopes,values,identities,and capa-bilities.Civil society is often not civil at all;many \u201ccommunities\u201dhave little in com-mon.Individuals and households may dis-agree about collective objectives and workto promote their own views,both individu-ally and through associations,sometimes atthe direct expense ofothers.The capabilityfor collective action ofcitizens,a key ele-ment ofservice delivery,varies widelyacross societies.Politicians and policymakers.What dis-tinguishes the sovereign state from all otherinstitutions is its monopoly on the legiti-mate use ofphysical force within its bound-aries.From this monopoly,politiciansderive the power to regulate,to legislate,totax\u2014to set and enforce the \u201crules ofthegame.\u201dPoliticians are de\ufb01ned here as thosewho control this power and discharge thefundamental responsibilities ofthe state.This does not mean that electoral politicsare always in play:some politicians areheads ofone-party states,some haveimposed their control through militaryforce,some arrive by election.In some sys-tems executive politicians are dominant\u2014in others,legislative politicians.The other actors who exercise the powerofthe state are policymakers.In some coun-tries politicians are also policymakers.Butin others there is a clear distinction betweenthe highest nonelected of\ufb01cials ofgovern-ment\u2014civil servants or appointees\u2014andpolitical actors.Politicians set general direc-tions,but policymakers set the fundamentalrules ofthe game for service providers tooperate\u2014by regulating entry,enforcingstandards,and determining the conditionsunder which providers receive public funds.Organizational providers.A providerorganization can be a public line organiza-tion,whatever the name\u2014ministry,depart-ment,agency,bureau (table 3.1).It can be aministry ofeducation that provides educa-tion services,an autonomous public enter-prise (autonomous public hospitals),aFigure 3.2Key relationships of powerVoiceCompactThe statePoliticiansPolicymakersCitizens/clientsClient

single community-runprimary school).There can be several typesofproviders (public,nonpro\ufb01t,and for-pro\ufb01t hospitals) and several providers ofeach type delivering the same service in thesame area (many independently operatednonpro\ufb01t and for-pro\ufb01t private hospitals).When the organizational provider is inthe public sector,one needs to be clearabout the analytical distinction between thepolicymaker and the head ofthe providerorganization.The policymaker sets andenforces the rules ofthe game for allproviders\u2014including the organizationalprovider.The head ofthe provider organi-zation makes internal \u201cpolicies\u201dspeci\ufb01c tothe organization.Clear conceptually,thedistinction is not always clear in practice,especially when the same individual playsboth roles.For example,a minister ofpub-lic works may be the policymaker responsi-ble for making and enforcing the rules forall providers\u2014but also the head ofthelargest organizational provider ofwater ser-vices,directly responsible for management.Unbundling these roles to create a cleardelineation ofpolicymaking and direct pro-duction responsibilities is one element inhaving clear lines ofaccountability.Frontline providers.In the end,nearly allservices require a provider who comes indirect contact with clients\u2014teachers,doc-tors,nurses,midwives,pharmacists,engi-neers,and so on.The four relationships ofaccountabilityOfpoliticians to citizens: voice and politics.This Report uses the term voiceto expressthe complex relationships ofaccountabilitybetween citizens and politicians.Voice isabout politics,but it covers much more.The voice relationship includes formalpolitical mechanisms (political parties andelections) and informal ones (advocacygroups and public information campaigns).Delegation and \ufb01nance between citizen andstate are the decisions about pursuing col-lective objectives and mobilizing ofpublicresources to meet those objectives.Citizensneed information about how actions ofthestate have promoted their well-being.Theyalso need some mechanism for enforceabil-ity,to make sure that politicians and policy-makers are rewarded for good actions andpenalized for bad ones.Ifpoliticians haveabused their position,or even just not pur-sued objectives aggressively and effectively,citizens need a variety ofmechanisms\u2014notjust periodic elections\u2014to make politiciansand policymakers accountable.07_WDR_Ch03.qxd  8/14/03  7:58 AM  Page 50\x0c(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank\n\nThe framework for service provision51Ofthe organizational provider to the state:compacts.The relationships between pol-icymakers and service providers can bethought ofas compacts.The compact is notalways as speci\ufb01c and legally enforceable asa contract,though a contract can be oneform ofa compact.Instead,it is a broadagreement about a long-term relationship.The policymaker provides resources anddelegates powers and responsibility for col-lective objectives to the service providers.The policymaker generates informationabout the performance oforganizations.Enforceability comes into play when thecompact also speci\ufb01es the rewards (andpossibly the penalties) that depend on theservice provider\u2019s actions and outputs.Theline between \u201cthe state\u201dand \u201cpublic sectororganizational provider\u201dis not always easyto draw.Ofthe frontline professionals to the organi-zational provider: management.In everyorganization,formal and informal tools ofmanagement provide frontline workerswith assignments and delineated areas ofresponsibility,equipping them with theresources to act.In public agencies thismanagement function is at times blurredbecause providers are employees of\u201cthegovernment.\u201dBut all the standard manage-ment issues ofselecting,training,and moti-vating workers in an organization apply toall organizations\u2014private,NGO,govern-ment,whatever.All service provision orga-nizations\u2014whether a government min-istry,a religious body,a nonpro\ufb01t NGO,ora for-pro\ufb01t \ufb01rm\u2014have to create a relation-ship ofaccountability with their frontlineproviders.Ofthe provider to the citizen-client: clientpower.Because the policymaker cannotspecify all actions ofproviders in the com-pact,citizens must reveal to providers theirdemand for services and monitor theproviders\u2019provision ofservices.Clients andorganizational providers interact throughthe individuals who provide services\u2014teachers,doctors,engineers,repairmen\u2014the frontline professionals and frontlineworkers.Accountability is not the only relationship The foregoing description is not reality,because it portrays only one direction in therelationships between actors.The reality isthat actors are embedded in a complex setofrelationships,and accountability is notalways the most important.Through vari-ous forms ofcoercion,both subtle and bla-tant,many states\u2019ability to impose obliga-tionson citizens has proved much strongerthan the ability ofcitizens to disciplinepoliticians and policymakers (box 3.2).Andin many cases citizens approach the stateand its agents as supplicants.Politicians often use the control overpublicly provided services as a mechanismofclientelism\u2014for both citizens andproviders.In systems that lack accountabil-ity relationships,public service jobs (teach-ers,policemen) are given as political favors,which creates a relationship not ofaccount-ability but ofpolitical obligation.A recentreport on education in Nepal,for instance,\ufb01nds that \u201cteachers\u2019performance standardsare nonexistent.Most teachers are alignedwith one ofthe many associations formedon political party lines and appointmentand deployment practices are often deter-mined as a result ofindividual\u2019s contribu-tions to political activities.\u201d163Accountability is more a rubric than a singleitem,but it is a fruitful rubric for makinguseful distinctions.Political accountability is the willingnessof politicians and policymakers to justify theiractions and to accept electoral,legal,oradministrative penalties if their justi\ufb01cation isfound lacking.Even within \u201cpolitical\u201daccount-ability one can have distinctions.With verticalpolitical accountability,citizens individually orcollectively hold the state to account\u2014say,through voting or advocacy.Democraciesmust have some vertical accountability.Withhorizontal political accountability,agents ofthe state formally hold another agent of thestate accountable\u2014say,through the\u201ccompact\u201drelationship between policymak-ers and providers.Authoritarian states may manifest con-siderable horizontal accountability (\u201cthetrains run on time\u201d),but not offer any verti-cal accountability.But where the relation-ship between clients and providers is verystrong (in some instances perhaps becauseof the omnipresence of the ruling party,asin Cuba),service delivery may work verywell without much vertical accountability.Even for a given type of accountabilitythere are distinctions.Formal horizontalpolitical accountability is the formaldescription of institutions,and authorityamong agents of the state.It may differsharply from informal horizontal politicalaccountability,from the actual working ofinstitutions and effective control over deci-sions in state organizations.Sources:Goetz and Jenkins (2002) and Aghionand Tirole (1997).BOX 3.2The many meanings ofaccountability07_WDR_Ch03.qxd  8/14/03  7:58 AM  Page 51\x0c(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank\n\n52WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Services are allocated in ways thatreward (or punish) communities for theirpolitical support.Sometimes the ministry isthe agent ofthe providers,not the otherway around,and providers capture the poli-cymaking.Providers also use their ability tocontrol services and their superior socialstatus to intimidate poor people.Ratherthan client power,there is provider power.The political scientist James Scott hasargued that the pressures of\u201cauthoritarianhigh modernism\u201dcan mean that the stateand its bureaucratic apparatus de\ufb01ne a\u201cthin simpli\ufb01cation\u201din order to carry outservices\u2014but that the domination ofthisreality over citizens and their complex real-ity can lead to unintended consequences.Why establishing relationshipsof accountability is so complex This Report moves beyond what the publicsector should do and emphasizes how pub-lic action can be made most effective.Frontline workers have to have clear objec-tives,adequate resources,technical capabili-ties,and the motivation to create valuedservices.This cannot be mandated.It is theresult ofinteractions between strong actorsin each ofthe key service provision roles.The ideal:a state that is strong,not weak.Provider organizations that have a clearvision and mission ofservice provision,notones that are internally incoherent andmerely process oriented.Frontlineproviders acting with professional auton-omy and initiative,not tightly controlledautomatons.And empowered citizens whodemand services,not passive \u201crecipients\u201dwho are acted on.Strong,capable actors need to be embed-ded in strong relationships ofaccountability.But it is dif\ufb01cult to establish such relation-ships for these services.Why?", u"['SDG_3', 'SDG_6', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_12']\u2022Because there are both collective objec-tives and private objectives,a system thatcreated only client power through choice(say) would meet only individual objec-tives,not the many public ones.\u2022Because ofthe multiple,complex objec-tives ofpublic production and co-production,it is dif\ufb01cult to create out-come-based enforceability for providers.Individual interests and collective objectivesA competitive market automatically createsaccountability ofsellers to buyers.The keyinformation is customer satisfaction,andthe key enforceability is the customer\u2019schoice ofsupplier.Competitive marketshave proved a remarkably robust institu-tional arrangement for meeting individualinterests.But they are not enough for ser-vices\u2014for three reasons.\u2022First,the market responds only to thosewith purchasing power,doing nothing toensure universal access or an equitabledistribution,which societies often haveas a collective objective.\u2022Second,the sum ofthe individual inter-ests may not produce the best outcomebecause markets may have failures ofvarious kinds.\u2022Third,other collective objectives requirepublic action.For instance,the state andsociety have a strong concern about therole ofschooling in the socialization ofyouth and may not want parents tochoose for themselves.The problem ofmonitoringLocally produced services\u2014basic educa-tion,health care,urban water supply andsanitation\u2014have three characteristics thatmake it particularly dif\ufb01cult to structurerelationships ofaccountability.They arediscretionary and transaction-intensive.There are multiple tasks and multiple prin-cipals.And it is dif\ufb01cult to attribute out-comes.Discretionary and transaction-intensive.Services are transaction-intensive,and thetransactions require discretion.Teachersmust continuously decide about the paceand structure ofclassroom activity.Havethe ideas been grasped?", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_12']That wouldencourage false arrests to meet production quo-tas.Surveys of citizen perceptions of safety?These risk overzealous police violating therights of the socially disadvantaged to pleasethe minority.Penalties for abuse of authority?Police might then do too little.Recent experience in several cities,notablyNew York,shows that better measurement ofseveral important outputs is possible.Crimerates were measured by neighborhood,reported regularly as a management tool,usedto allocate police time and visibility.Crime ratesfell signi\ufb01cantly.This approach can back\ufb01re,though,if the desired outcomes are not wellspeci\ufb01ed.Studies of police behavior in Londonand Los Angeles showed that the monitoredand numerically measured activities (crime ratesand citizen complaints) improved markedly.Butother measures\u2014community activities andcrime rates,particularly for homicide\u2014gotworse.So there is no general \u201coptimal\u201dsolution.Butthere are solutions to particular cases,better orworse in their adaptation to local circumstance.Creating more functional police servicesrequires creating multiple institutional channelsof accountability\u2014political (police are not sim-ply an instrument of oppression),compacts(policymakers can hold police in check),man-agement (organizational strategies caninculcate dedication,loyalty,restraint),and clientpower (citizens have mechanisms to in\ufb02uencepolice behavior directly,a free press).Sources:Moore and others (2002);The Economist(2002);Burguess,Propper,and Wilson (2002);Pren-dergast (2001).BOX 3.3Creating conditions ofaccountability: the police07_WDR_Ch03.qxd  8/14/03  8:00 AM  Page 54\x0c(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank\n\nThe framework for service provision55exclusively in private hands (largely reli-gious).Today the direct production ofschooling by the public sector\u2014with thenation-state the dominant service provider,involved in every facet ofschooling frombuilding schools,to determining the cur-riculum and texts,to training,hiring,assigning,and controlling teachers as civilservants\u2014has completely triumphed as anidea,so completely that people forget it wasever contested (box 3.4).Public bureaucracies are truly a blessingofmodern life.All countries with high liv-ing standards have teachers who teach,police of\ufb01cers who police,judges whojudge,public works that work,armies thatrespond to external threats.Yes,bureaucra-cies might be frustrating,slow,inef\ufb01cient,and resistant to innovation.But the fantasyof\u201cgetting rid ofthe bureaucracy\u201dwouldturn into a nightmare.No country hasdeveloped without state reliance on aneffective public bureaucracy to dischargethe key functions ofthe state\u2014though notalways through direct production.So whydo some bureaucracies perform badly andothers well?", u"['SDG_4', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_12']The policymaker must care about out-comes,including those for poor people.That concern needs to be transmitted effec-tively to the public agencies that receivepublic resources to provide the services.And the public agencies must hire techni-cally quali\ufb01ed providers motivated to pro-vide the services.When all this happens,asit often does in developed countries,publicservice production is reliable and effective.Indeed,some ofthe most admired andeffective organizations in the world arepublic agencies.When the long route is not working,theframework provides a way to understandthe failures by identifying which relation-ship ofaccountability was the weak link\u2014and within the relationship ofaccountabil-ity,which was the missing dimension.\u2022There are voice failures,when the state(controlled by politicians and policy-makers) simply does not care about pro-viding services\u2014or does so in a strictlyvenal or clientelist manner.The clearestsign ofthis:when too little budget isdevoted to services for poor people,andwhen that budget is allocated to meetpolitical interests.Samuel Hays,in his study of the evolution ofconservation policy in the United States inthe early 20th century,expresses eloquentlythe political and social tensions in the shiftto modern bureaucracies:\u201cThe dynamics of conservation,with itstension between the centralizing tenden-cies of system and expertise on the onehand and decentralization and localism onthe other,is typical of a whole series of simi-lar tensions between centralization anddecentralization within modern ...society.The poles of the continuum along whichthese forces were arrayed can be describedbrie\ufb02y.On the one hand many facets ofhuman life were bound up with relativelysmall scale activities focusing on the dailyroutines of job,home,religion,school andrecreation in which a pattern of inter-per-sonal relationships developed within rela-tively small geographical areas....On theother hand,however,modern forms ofsocial organization gave rise to larger pat-terns of human interaction,to ties of occu-pation and profession over wide areas,tocorporate systems which extended into afar \ufb02ung network,to impersonal\u2014statisti-cal\u2014forms of understanding,to reliance onexpertise and to centralized manipulationand control....To many people the externalcharacteristics of this process\u2014ef\ufb01ciency,expertise,order\u2014constituted the spirit of\u201cprogressivism.\u201dThese new forms of organi-zation tended to shift the location of deci-sion-making away from the grass-roots,thesmaller contexts of life,to the largernetworks of human interaction.This upwardshift can be seen in many speci\ufb01c types...:the growth of city-wide systems of execu-tive action and representation in bothschool and general government to super-sede the previous focus on ward represen-tation and action;the similar upward shift inthe management of schools and roads fromthe township to the county and state.\u201cExamination of the evolution of con-servation political struggles,therefore,brings into sharp focus the two competingpolitical systems....On the one hand thespirit of science and technology,of rationalsystem and organization,shifted the loca-tion of decision-making continually upwardso as to narrow the range of in\ufb02uencesimpinging upon it and to guide that deci-sion-making process with large,cosmopoli-tan considerations,technical expertness,and the objectives of those involved in thewider networks of modern society.On theother however,were a host of politicalimpulses,often separate and con\ufb02icting,diffuse,and struggling against each otherwith in the larger political order.Their politi-cal activities sustained a more open politi-cal system ...in which complex and esotericfacts possessed by only a few were not per-mitted to dominate the process of decision-making,and the satisfaction of grassrootsimpulses remained a constantly viable ele-ment of the political order.\u201dSource:Hays (1959).BOX 3.4The \u201cProgressive Era\u201d: creation ofmodernbureaucracy07_WDR_Ch03.qxd  8/14/03  8:00 AM  Page 55\x0c(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank\n\n56WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004\u2022There are compact failures,in which thestate fails to communicate clear responsi-bilities for outputs or outcomes to thepublic organization and fails to enforceany responsibility.Compact failures arealso associated with management failures,in which the public sector organizationfails to motivate its frontline workers.All this is embedded in a system in whichthe feedback loop from client satisfaction toboth frontline and organizational providersis cut.Voice.A common cause ofthe failure ofpublic service production is the apathy ofthestate.Governments may care about someservices for ideological reasons.But whenvoice is weak (or divided or con\ufb02icted) andthe state is freed from the constraint ofsatis-fying its citizens,there are many possibilitiesfor failure.The state delivers little or nothingto its poor and socially disadvantaged citi-zens,reserving its few services for the elite,including favored members ofthe govern-ment.In these circumstances alternativestrategies ofpublic sector management willbe powerless to create better services.Many analysts and advocates point outthat resources devoted to services are inade-quate.But those budget allocations are theresult ofpolitical decisions:about the leveloftaxation and mobilization ofresources;about the allocations ofbudgets acrossactivities;about the design ofprograms thatdetermine who bene\ufb01ts;about the alloca-tion ofexpenditures across inputs (howmuch for wages and other things).Ifresources are inadequate,ifthey are ineffec-tively applied to service provision for poorpeople,it is often because poor people\u2019svoices are not being heard.Nor is much information generated thatwould allow citizens to judge how effec-tively their government is providing ser-vices.Since information is power,it is oftenclosely guarded\u2014or never created in the\ufb01rst place.Politicians seldom create infor-mation about outputs and outcomes.Indi-viduals know about the quality ofthe ser-vices they confront,but they have a dif\ufb01culttime translating that knowledge into publicpower.Indeed,politicians may use theselective provision ofservices as a clientelis-tic tool to \u201cbuy\u201dpolitical support\u2014or,worse,to enforce state control ofcitizenswhile weakening their voice (box 3.5).Compacts.The complex compact rela-tionship fails in many ways.In failed or fail-ing states (such as those the World Bankcalls Low-Income Countries Under Stress,or LICUS) there is no compact because thestate\u2019s control is very shallow.This happenswhen countries are embroiled in long civilwars (Afghanistan,El Salvador,Somalia,Sudan) or large parts ofthe country arebeyond the reach ofgovernment (Democ-ratic Republic ofCongo).Even in working states the compact rela-tionship between the state and publicprovider agencies is often extremely weak.The delegation and speci\ufb01cation ofgoalsare often vague or nonexistent,and thererarely are clear responsibilities for outputsor links to outcomes.Budget allocationsand staf\ufb01ng for agencies are determinedwithout any direct relationship to past per-formance or clearly speci\ufb01ed objectives.This means that providers are often under-funded relative to announced rhetorical,and unrealistic,targets.Without clear delegation ofresponsibili-ties and identi\ufb01ed objectives,there is no wayofgenerating the relevant performance infor-mation for managing or assessing the organi-zation.Without clear information on organi-zational objectives and progress,it becomesAn anthropological study of urban Cairodetailing the \u201cAvenues of Participation\u201d\u2014the ways residents coped with the demandsof the

went to purposes unrelated to educa-tion or for private gain,as indicated bynumerous newspaper articles about indict-ments ofdistrict education of\ufb01cers after thesurvey \ufb01ndings went public.To respond to the problem,the centralgovernment began publishing data onmonthly transfers ofgrants to districts innewspapers and to broadcast them on theradio.It required primary schools and dis-trict administrations to post notices on allin\ufb02ows offunds.This promoted account-ability by giving schools and parents accessto information needed to understand andmonitor the grant program.An evaluation ofthe information cam-paign reveals a large improvement.Schoolsare still not receiving the entire grant (andthere are delays).But the capture by inter-ests along the way has been reduced from80 percent in 1995 to 20 percent in 2001(\ufb01gure 2).A before-and-after assessmentcomparing outcomes for the same schoolsin 1995 and 2001\u2014and taking into accountschool-speci\ufb01c factors,household income,teachers\u2019education,school size,and super-vision\u2014suggests that the information cam-paign explains two-thirds ofthe massiveimprovement.In 1995 schools with access to newspa-pers and those without suffered just asmuch from the leakages.And from 1995 toUganda\u2019s macroeconomic stability since1992 has depended on budget reforms\u2014from a cash budget system to the medium-term expenditure framework to the PovertyEradication Action Plan.The frameworkaligns resources with budgetary priorities,while the cash budget system ensured thatoverall \ufb01scal discipline is maintained ifthereare revenue shortfalls.The Poverty ActionFund has been particularly effective in ensur-ing that government spending priorities,such as primary education,receive neededfunds.It seems unlikely that universalprimary education would have been sus-tainable without these innovations in bud-getary institutions.The power of information in delivering funds for educationIn 1996 a public expenditure tracking sur-vey oflocal governments and primaryschools revealed that only 13 percent oftheper-student capitation grants made it to theschools in 1991\u201395.173In 1995 for everydollar spent on nonwage education itemsby the central government,only about 20cents reached the schools,with local gov-ernments capturing most ofthe funding.Poor students suffered disproportion-ately,because schools catering to themreceived even less than others.Indeed,mostpoor schools received nothing.Case studyevidence and other data showed that theschool funds were not going to other sec-tors either.The disbursements were rarely2001 both groups experienced a large dropin leakage.But the reduction in capture wassigni\ufb01cantly higher for the schools

poor attach to it.Whenpublicly provided and funded housing is leftvacant,174when food supplies are not eaten,when free but empty public health clinicsare bypassed in favor ofexpensive privatecare,175this money is wasted.Improving services means making theinterests ofpoor people matter more toproviders.Engaging poor clients in anactive role\u2014as purchasers,as monitors,andas co-producers (the \u201cshort route\u201d)\u2014canimprove performance tremendously.How can public policy help poor peopleacquire better services through this route?By expanding the in\ufb02uence oftheir ownchoices.By having the income ofprovidersdepend more on the demands ofpoorclients.By increasing the purchasing powerofpoor people.And by providing betterinformation and a more competitive envi-ronment to improve the functioning ofser-vices.Where such choice is not feasible,governments can expand consumer powerby establishing procedures to make surecomplaints are acted on.Sad to say,governments and donors fre-quently neglect the possible role ofpoorclients in sustaining better services\u2014ortreat that role merely as an instrument forachieving a technically determined out-come.Neither governments nor donors areaccustomed to asking the poor for advice.Recent initiatives have begun to redress thisthrough a variety ofways to increase partic-ipation by communities and civil society.But the potential for improvement has notyet been adequately tapped.176In short,the key is to enhance the powerofpoor clients in service provision.ThisReport and this chapter try to give the term\u201cempowerment\u201da precise and concreteinterpretation.Speci\ufb01cally,the chapter dis-cusses the potential for poor people toin\ufb02uence services by:\u2022Increasing their individual purchasingpower.\u2022Increasing their collective power overproviders by organizing in groups.\u2022Increasing their \u201ccapacity to aspire\u201d177:allowing them to take advantage ofthe\ufb01rst two by increasing the informationneeded to develop their personal sense ofcapability and entitlement.178When will strengthening the client-producer link matter most?In the framework ofchapter 3,improvingclient power\u2014the short route ofservice deliv-ery\u2014can overcome various weaknesses ofthelong route (\ufb01gure 4.1),even when servicesremain the responsibility ofgovernment.Theclearest case is monitoring providers.Clientsare usually in a better position to see what isgoing on than most supervisors in govern-ment hierarchies\u2014who provide the compactand management.When the policymaker-provider link is weak because ofscarce or dif\ufb01-cult-to-manage supervisory staff,clients maybe the only ones who regularly interact withproviders.As discussed

ofpreferences applies all the waydown to the individual.Take courtesy andcomfort (caring) relative to technical skill(curing) in health delivery\u2014or farmers withconstraints on their time and other workersin the same community with different con-straints.Certainly people differ in theamounts ofwater and electricity they want,given their other needs.Government struc-tures may not be \ufb02exible enough to accom-modate this variety.And where local prefer-ences vary systematically between the poorand others,honoring poor people\u2019s prefer-ences over those ofthe better-offcan be achallenge.For some collective action problems,gov-ernments may not be located at the correctlevel to solve them,no matter how willingthey are to pursue the interests ofthe poor.The boundaries ofthe political jurisdictionmay not correspond to the boundaries oftheproblem.So schools are often the mostappropriate unit for management and opera-tion.Sanitation services need communitypressure to ensure that everyone uses \ufb01xed-point defecation,but they are often organizedaround communities that are larger orsmaller than villages,depending on the den-sity ofpopulation.A more active role

profound source ofpower forpoor people.When Zambian truck driverswere expected to pay into a road fund,theytook turns policing a bridge crossing tomake sure overloaded trucks did not pass.Their money would have to be used to \ufb01xthe bridge.Women living in slum areas ofRio de Janeiro proudly display bills theypaid for water and sanitation\u2014it provestheir inclusion in society and their right

ef\ufb01ciently.Households determine water and electricityuse,scarce goods that have costs associatedwith them.And facing marginal costs is theonly way to ensure ef\ufb01cient use.The alterna-tives:wasted water leading to shortages,unreliable service with serious consequencesfor the safety ofthe water supply,and peri-odic cuts in electricity familiar to most peo-ple in developing countries.Protecting thepoor in network services can be achieved(assuming that meters work) with \u201clifeline\u201dsubsidies,in which the \ufb01rst few essentialunits are free but full marginal costs are paidbeyond this level.In health care,as in water and electricity,more is not always better.Restrictingdemand for curative services by pricingfrees up providers,particularly publicproviders,to do preventive health,forwhich there is little private demand.187Asthe director ofa prominent nongovern-mental organization providing health careto the very poorest in Bangladesh puts it:\u201cOfcourse you must charge at least a tokenamount for services,otherwise you keepseeing people with paper cuts and otherminor things.\u201d188Similarly,crowding atoutpatient clinics at public hospitals can becurtailed by charging enough so that peopleuse a cheaper level ofservice.All these advantages can be obtained inways other than charging fees at the point ofservice.As long as clients consider theresources used as belonging to them,the dis-cipline ofmarket-like mechanisms can beenforced.The Singapore Medical SavingsAccounts do this by allowing people to applyfunds not used for primary medical care toother purposes,such as pensions.189Coun-tries with scarce administrative personneland supervisory capacity may certainly wantto enlist clients as monitors,and marketmechanisms are one way ofdoing it.For any ofthese mechanisms to work,however,there must be a real choice withreal options.Otherwise,giving schools pay-Surveys in nine transition countries of

\ufb01x.Conversely,market mechanisms with a natural monop-oly don\u2019t improve matters either.There isno denying that sparsely populated ruralareas\u2014where many ofthe world\u2019s poorpeople live\u2014are much more constrained bycompetitive supply than urban areas.Buteven these markets may be \u201ccontestable\u201dinthe sense that other providers would be ableto enter the market ifthe current providerabused monopoly power or ifmonopolieswere periodically granted on the basis ofcompetitive bids.Policies to improve choiceChoice-based improvements alone cannot bea solution to the problem ofbad services forthe poor,though some may remain as instru-ments in a longer-run strategy by govern-ment.In some cases the market would beexpected to wither away as the state increasesits capabilities.In the meantime,three cate-gories ofpolicies can make the most out ofclients acting on their own behalf:\u2022Increasing the power ofthe poor overproviders by providing them with\ufb01nance directly.\u2022Increasing competition.\u2022Increasing information about servicesand providers.Increasing the purchasing power ofthe poor.The big problem with services that can,inprinciple,be provided in markets is thatpoor people don\u2019t have enough money topay for them.For market mechanisms tohelp the poor,their purchasing power mustbe increased.The voucher mechanisms dis-cussed are a direct way ofhandling this forspeci\ufb01c services.But additional mileage cancome from more \ufb02exible transfers that canbe used for purposes that the family chooses.Flexible transfers can help to overcomethe weakness ofthe citizen-policymaker linkby giving poor people more direct say in whatgets delivered than even the political processwould give them\u2014the transfers become theirmoney.Substantial work in South Africa hasshown the bene\ufb01cial effects ofcash pensionpayments on the health and well-being ofallmembers ofa family.190For services withlarge externalities,demand for the servicemay not be great enough,even when the ser-vice is free,so the Bolsa Escola program inBrazil paid families to send their children toschool,as did the secondary school programfor girls in Bangladesh,while the Education,Health,and Nutrition Program (Progresa) inMexico paid families to use preventive healthcare (see spotlight).Cash payments have problems though.First,giving unconstrained cash transfers topoor people is often not politically palatable.Second,cash payments always have to beadministratively targeted,which requiresdeterminations ofeligibility.Everyone likesmoney,so self-targeting ofcash transfers isnot possible.Ifa government has a hard timegetting goods and services into the hands ofthe poor,it may well have an even harder timegetting cash,or cash equivalents,to them.A conversation with farmers in Haryana state inIndia,who had been to see what had happenedin reforming Andhra Pradesh (AP):Q:\u201cWhat did you learn when

allowing a private sector to emergewhere laws previously restricted entry.Jor-dan,after years ofprohibition,allowed pri-vate universities in 1990.Ten years later,enrollments in these institutions accountedfor one-third ofall university students.Bangladesh has had a similar experience inthe past decade.This increase in competi-tion allows governments to increase enroll-ments without extremely regressive subsi-dies to public universities.Competition can also be encouraged byallowing subsidies to the poor to beportable between public and privateproviders.Private providers may not existsimply because the public sector is free.Governments can increase competition bychanging the form ofsubsidy from zeroprice to competitive prices,with cash orvoucher payments to compensate.Univer-sity education government loans,usable atany eligible institution,can increase compe-tition,improve quality in public facilities,and reduce subsidies for all but studentsfrom poor families.In some cases competition is not possible,at least not without substantial regulation.Health insurance markets are notoriouslyprone to failure,and competition withinthem can lead to both inef\ufb01cient andinequitable outcomes,since \ufb01rms can com-pete by excluding the sick,not by being moreef\ufb01cient.Network services are also hard torun without a monopoly.But in each casethese markets can be contestable,capturingmuch ofthe bene\ufb01t ofcompetition.Some readers may think that the forego-ing arguments are just an attempted justi\ufb01ca-tion for user fees.This is wrong,for all thereasons put forth here.So,to make things asclear as possible,the pros and cons ofuserfees in general are laid out in box 4.4.Thereare times when user fees are appropriate\u2014and some when they are not.Based on theprimary goal ofmaking services work forpoor people,this Report argues against anyblanket policy on user fees that encompassesall services in all country circumstances.Increasing information to improve choices byconsumers.One critical limit to well-func-tioning competitive markets is the consumer\u2019sawareness.The private sector is a mixed bag.Private \u201cmedical\u201dproviders vary from quitegood doctors (including senior specialistsfrom government hospitals in their off-hours)to totally unquali\ufb01ed,untrained people,someofwhom are downright dangerous.191Privateor NGO schools may cater to speci\ufb01c skills notprovided in public schools (foreign language,religious studies,arts and music) or they mayjust be pro\ufb01teers.An essential part ofimprov-ing peoples\u2019choices is to provide informationabout these providers.Many times,peoplesimply don\u2019t know enough to choose better orworse services.And sometimes they identifygood medical care with powerful medi-cines\u2014which is quite wrong and potentiallydangerous.Information can be advice to families onhow to choose schools or medical care-givers192or on how to take care ofthem-selves.This might be supplemented with var-ious certi\ufb01cation programs,standard setting,and laboratory checks (say,for water purity).Scorecards ofpublic services should also beextended to private or NGO providers.Onthe other side ofthe market,governmentmay want to directly improve the quality ofprivate services.Training,\u201cpartnership\u201darrangements,contracting,and other meansofengagement can all be tried.But attemptsto increase information should be subject torigorous evaluation (chapter 6).Increasing consumer powerthrough participationThe accountability ofproviders to clients canalso be achieved when people voice their con-cerns.In this case,enforceability is notthrough clients\u2019money but through theirdirect interaction\u2014encouragement and com-plaints.The scope for poor people to voicecomplaints individually is very small.In richcountries individuals get help from systems oftort law that can handle individual litigationand from government-sponsored of\ufb01ces ofconsumer protection or ombudsmen.Butthese are rare to nonexistent for the poor indeveloping countries (they don\u2019t always workso well for the poor in rich countries either).Some problems for which voice might beexpected to work are intractable.Oneexample is corruption:the public might09_WDR_Ch04.qxd  8/14/03  8:11 AM  Page 70\x0c(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank\n\nClients and providers71resent under-the-table payments,but theremay be no incentive to complain if,say,adoctor is using public facilities and materi-als at the same time.Clients know that theservice is still cheaper than ifthey had to goto the market,and so do not complain.193There is a deeper constraint:even whenthere is an opportunity to redress com-plaints,monitoring and follow-through arepublic goods\u2014the bene\ufb01ts accrue to theentire group while the costs are borne by afew.This is true for communities as well asindividuals,but groups ofpeople generally\ufb01nd it easier to elicit support from mem-bers than from individuals going it alone.So client power expressed outside markettransactions will almost always be expressedthrough collective action.Strengthening participation along theclient-provider link can \ufb01x problems in thelong route ofgovernment provision.So com-munity groups that take on complaining,monitoring,and other means ofmaking surethings work properly would be expected atsome point to become institutionalizedwithin government (most likely local govern-ment),or possibly to be supplanted by gov-ernment as it improves.After all,collectiveThe wide range of services and countrycircumstances discussed in this Reportmakes it impossible to claim that a par-ticular level of user fees or none at all isappropriate in every case.User fees,aswith other public policy decisions,mustbalance protection of the poor,ef\ufb01ciency in allocation,and the abilityto guarantee that services can be imple-mented and sustained.The following\ufb02owchart summarizes the argumentsand references in the text and raisesmost of the issues necessary in deter-mining whether user fees of any sortare appropriate in a given case.Threepoints:\u2022First,\u201cef\ufb01ciency\u201dis shorthand forstandard principles of publiceconomics (see any textbook) thatoften but not always require pricesthat equal social marginal cost andmay include subsidies,taxes,or otherinterventions independent of theirdistributional effects.For example,infectious disease control measureswill have a subsidy element becauseof their external effects regardless oftheir impact on poor people.\u2022Second,it is assumed that all subsi-dies are paid for by taxes.The neteffect on poor people depends ontheir contribution to tax revenue(possibly substantial when taxes arebased on agricultural exports) and ontheir share of the deadweight lossthat taxes impose on the economy.\u2022Third,even when prices are notcharged at point of service,commu-nities may want to makecontributions to capital costs by,say,helping to construct or maintainschools.BOX 4.4No blanket policy on user feesYesYesYesNoNoNoNoNoNoYesYesYesYesIs the service

nonexistent,and in Guinea,health services had almost totally disap-peared\u2014except in the capital city,Conakry\u2014during the last years oftheSekou Toure regime.The vast majority ofpoor families

with access to serviceswithin 5 kilometers to 86 percent in Benin,60 percent in Guinea,and 40 percent inMali,covering more than 20 million peo-ple.Importantly,a legal framework wasdeveloped to support

5.1Why are public health and education services so dif\ufb01cult to get to poor people?11_WDR_Ch05.qxd  8/14/03  8:37 AM  Page 82\x0c(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The

religious divisionsfor electoral advantage and was repeatedlyreelected despite the damage his policies didto the city\u2019s growth (box 5.2).It is this effect ofsocial polarization onpolitical incentives that partly accounts forthe empirical evidence on the negative cor-relation between ethnic heterogeneity andthe availability ofpublic goods.242Moregenerally,basic public services,particularlythose that are not easily excludable such asprimary education,can also deterioratewhere there is social fragmentation\u2014somesocial groups do not want to pay for publicgoods that bene\ufb01t other groups.243Credible politiciansEven when voters are informed,public pol-icy can fall short when the promises ofpoliticians are not credible.When candi-dates cannot or do not make crediblepromises before elections (because aban-doning promises costs election winners lit-tle),incumbents are more insulated fromthe disciplining effects ofpolitical competi-tion.Challengers cannot mount effectivecampaigns because they cannot convincevoters that they will do a better job.Fur-thermore,ifpoliticians are credible only totheir \u201cclients,\u201dmore public resources will beallocated to these clients.This can havelarge implications for universal health andeducation services.Incumbents enjoygreater discretion to pursue goals otherthan those preferred by the majority ofciti-zens who may be poor,goals such as provid-ing narrowly targeted services to their sup-porters at the cost ofmore universal publicservices that bene\ufb01t all.244Credibility and credit go hand in hand.Credibility problems also arise when politi-cal competitors make credible promises buttheir term in of\ufb01ce is too short to claimcredit for policies with long maturing out-comes.Promises ofjobs or public worksprojects can be delivered soon after an elec-tion.But promises to improve educationquality and outcomes are much less credi-ble.Similarly,voters can easily credit apolitician for building a school or assigningteachers,but they can less easily verify thatthe politician is responsible when the build-ing is maintained or supplied,or when theteacher is present and competent.Ifpoliti-cians cannot take credit for their efforts toimprove teacher quality,teacher quality islikely to be low\u2014and voters are unlikely toexpect anything else.In Pakistan nonprofes-sional considerations have been common inthe placement ofteachers.245The incentivesfacing local politicians have been importantfactors in the low quality ofrural schools(box 5.3).In many countries,politicians do notcampaign on their policy record,probity,orhistory ofprogram involvement or on thepolicy record oftheir party.Voters then arelikely to believe politicians who have shownthemselves to be reliable sources ofpersonalassistance.They might be locally in\ufb02uentialpeople who have helped families by provid-ing loans or jobs or by resolving bureau-cratic dif\ufb01culties.Without well-developedpolitical parties or national leaders who arecredible,promises oftargeted favors are allthat voters can rely on in making electoralchoices.Described as \u201cThe Rascal King,\u201dJamesMichael Curley dominated politics in Bostonfor half the 20th century,holding electedof\ufb01ce,among others,as four-time city mayorbetween 1913 and 1950,besides servingtwo prison terms on corruption charges.Admired by working-class Irish families,Cur-ley was noted for his railing against theProtestant Yankee establishment and for hisrough-and-tumble ways.Curley used patronage,cash,and rhetoricto shape his electorate,driving the richerProtestant citizens out of the city to ensurehis political longevity.Curley\u2019s tools ofpatronage were public services,large con-struction projects,and public employment.In his \ufb01rst year as mayor,Curley raised thesalaries of police patrolmen and school cus-todians but cut the salaries of higher-rankingpolice of\ufb01cers and school doctors (Beatty1992).Miles of sidewalks were laid in Irishneighborhoods,but the cobblestones ofswank Yankee neighborhoods crumbled(O\u2019Connor 1995).Boston did not \ufb02ourishunder Curley:between 1910 and 1950,it hadthe lowest population growth rate of anyU.S.city of comparable size.Glaeser and Shleifer (2002) call this the\u201cCurley effect\u201d\u2014increasing the size of one\u2019spolitical base,or maintaining it,through dis-tortionary,wealth-reducing policies.They useit to shed light on the ethnic and class politicsof service delivery when the net effect is toimpoverish the overall community.They showhow the Curley effect may apply to Detroit,USA,to contemporary Zimbabwe,and to theLabor party in the United Kingdom before

dif\ufb01cult.Problems ofpolitical credibility can causebad policies to become entrenched.Coun-tries often adopt poverty strategies based onsubsidies for consumption and agriculturalproduction,sometimes at the expense ofbroad public services such as education andhealth that might have resulted in lowerpoverty and more economic growth.Indiasubsidizes electricity,ostensibly for poorfarmers.Once political credibility is stronglylinked to a particular policy such as deliver-ing subsidized electricity,these policies con-tinue to receive greater public resources thanthey would ifall political promises wereequally credible.Vested interests developaround suboptimal policies\u2014rich farmerscapture the power subsidy\u2014which makeschange even more dif\ufb01cult.ClientelismClientelism is characterized by an excessivetendency for political patrons to provideprivate rewards to clients.Politicians allo-cate public spending to win elections.To doso,they can provide public goods that canimprove everyone\u2019s welfare (public goodsthat are extensive,such as law and order,universal education,with no rivalry orexcludability).Or they can target localities(local public goods,projects limited to ajurisdiction) or individuals and speci\ufb01cgroups (clientelism).246What distinguishes clientelism?", u"['SDG_1', 'SDG_4', 'SDG_6', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_11']Clien-telism implies a credible threat ofexclusionfrom a stream ofbene\ufb01ts ifthe voterchooses to vote for the opposition.247Thusan incumbent politician can use clientelismto deter core supporters from switchingsupport.Clientelism is hard to pursue forlocal or extensive public goods\u2014bene\ufb01cia-ries are not reliable clients because they cansupport the opposition and still bene\ufb01t.The Programa Nacional de Solidaridad(PRONASOL) poverty alleviation programin Mexico spent an average of1.2 percent ofGDP annually on water,electricity,nutri-tion,and education in poor communitiesbetween 1989 and 1994.248Municipalitiesdominated by the Institutional Revolution-ary Party (PRI),the party in power,receivedsigni\ufb01cantly higher per capita transfers thanmunicipalities that voted in another party(\ufb01gure 5.3).An assessment ofPRONASOLspending suggests that it reduced poverty byonly about 3 percent.Had the budget beendistributed for impact on poverty ratherthan party loyalty,the expected declinewould have been 64 percent with perfect tar-geting,and it would have been 13 percenteven with an untargeted,universal propor-tional transfer to the whole population.249Even ifvoters want to vote for an opposi-tion party or candidate,they might bedeterred by the fear ofbeing penalized bythe withholding offunds by a centralauthority.So voters may end up keeping aparty they may dislike in power in order toensure funding for local public services.This is compounded by a coordinationproblem.Even ifthe majority oflocalitieswanted to vote against the incumbent party,without certainty about what other locali-ties planned to do,the majority would endup supporting the ruling party to avoidstrategic miscoordination and the penaltyofloss offunds.Clientelism can also be the outcome ofpolitical competition when the credibilityofpolitical competitors is limited\u2014politi-cal promises are credible only to \u201cclients.\u201d250Politicians with clientelist ties can ful\ufb01llcampaign promises better than politiciansElected of\ufb01cials in Pakistan have demon-strated an extraordinary interest in target-ing services to their supporters,but muchless interest in services such as primary edu-cation that all voters can enjoy.Contribut-ing to this outcome are three aspects ofrural Pakistani politics:identity-driven poli-tics,voting blocs that make it easy to iden-tify core supporters,and costly elections.Voter ignorance,poor information onpolitical competitors,and the absence ofparty credibility on broad policy issuesencourage politicians and voters to buildpersonal relationships that make pre-elec-tion promises more credible.Because theserelationships are personal,they tend to bebased on narrow,excludable servicespromised and delivered to core supporters.The distance between rural communitiesboosts the political ef\ufb01ciency of targetingpolitical bene\ufb01ts\u2014it is easier to site schools,roads,and water pipes close to supportersand far from nonsupporters.Voting by blocs of supporters makespatronage a more effective political strategythan the provision of well-functioningservices that must be provided to all.Costlyelections drive politicians to provide publicservices to supporters who can be dependedon to vote for them at low out-of-pocket cost.Under these conditions,schools mayget built for the corruption,employment,and pro\ufb01t opportunities that constructionprovides.Teachers are hired less on meritand more on how best to apportion patron-age,particularly when absenteeism is notpenalized.There are,in contrast,fewsystemic political incentives to make sureschools run well,teachers remain account-able,and children learn.Source:World Bank (2002l).BOX 5.3Better to build rural schools than to run themwell in Pakistan11_WDR_Ch05.qxd  8/14/03  8:38 AM  Page 84\x0c(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and

ofpoliticalpatrons ful\ufb01lling their promises to clients.Itis much more dif\ufb01cult to target the services ofa well-run village primary school or clinic.Cross-country evidence on public invest-ment supports the contention that credibil-ity and clientelism signi\ufb01cantly in\ufb02uencethe provision ofpublic services.There areno variables that directly capture the credi-bility ofpre-electoral promises or the extentofclientelism.But it is possible to argue thatin young democracies political competitorsare less likely to be able to make crediblepromises to all voters and are more likely torely on clientelist promises,and as thesedemocracies age,politicians are more likelyto increase the number ofclients since theycan count on client loyalty.A study sum-marizing the evidence shows that targetedspending\u2014public investment\u2014is higher inyoung democracies than in old and as young democracies age,targeted spendingincreases.251Corruption falls as democraciesage.These results are relevant for universalbasic services since they are likely to be oflower quantity when public investment ishigh and oflower quality when corruptionis high.Similar cross-country evidence onsecondary and primary school enrollmentsupports the view that credibility is a signi\ufb01-cant in\ufb02uence on the provision ofpublicservices.252Beyond the ballot box:citizen initiatives to increaseaccountabilityWhen elections are not enough to make ser-vices work for poor people,political pres-sure builds for new approaches that enablecitizens to hold politicians and policymak-ers more directly accountable for services.These activities do not replace the electoralprocess,but complement it to strengthenthe long route ofaccountability.The emer-gence ofsuch citizen initiatives and theirmobilizing potential has been accompaniedby an information revolution that has dra-matically simpli\ufb01ed information exchangeand citizen access to of\ufb01cial information.Enthusiasm for direct citizen involve-ment also comes from mounting frustrationwith the dominant mode ofa national civilservice delivering services that meet sometechnically predetermined \u201cneeds\u201dofthepopulation.253This frustration has led togreater interest in directly empowering citi-zens and overcoming collective action prob-lems,driven also by the \ufb01nding that civicrelationships and social capital are impor-tant determinants ofgovernment ef\ufb01cacy.254Broad range ofissues and toolsThe rapid growth ofcitizen initiatives hasbeen described as a new accountabilityagenda.It involves \u201ca more direct role forordinary people and their associations indemanding accountability across a morediverse set ofjurisdictions,using anexpanded repertoire ofmethods,on thebasis ofa more exacting standard ofsocialjustice.\u201d255Citizens are combining electoralaccountability and participation with whatwould traditionally have been consideredthe of\ufb01cial accountability activities ofthestate.These initiatives address accountabil-ity at various levels.Some are aimed atstrengthening voice in service delivery byenabling answerability and some at pushingfurther for enforceability.These initiatives,and the state\u2019s response,employ a numberofold and new tools,including tools basedon information technology.These citizen initiatives cover a far-reach-ing array ofissues,from improving law andorder in Karachi256to preparing citizenreport cards.They vary tremendously inscale,ranging from global knowledge-shar-ing coalitions,such as Shack/Slum Dwellers\u2019International,257to community efforts inMumbai to monitor arrivals ofsubsidizedgoods at local \u201cfair price\u201dshops in order toexpose fraud in India\u2019s public

criminal record.On budget analysis,initiatives at one endseek to make national budgets accessible tocitizens and at the other to promote village-level participatory audits oflocal publicexpenditures (box 5.4).These citizen initiatives also use a broadrange oftools,from door-to-door signaturecampaigns to cyber-activism.The rapidgrowth ofthe Internet and communicationtechnologies has dramatically altered citizenvoice nationally and internationally,thoughaccess is still limited by income and connec-tivity.Some innovative e-government appli-cations are reducing corruption and deliverytimes and increasing service predictabilityand convenience.Karnataka,among India\u2019sleading states in information technology,has pioneered a computerized land recordssystem to serve rural households (box 5.5).Controversy and con\ufb02ict ofinterestTwo separate trends are discernible in citi-zen voice initiatives:activities based on con-sultation,dialogue,and information shar-ing,and activities more direct andcontroversial,related to monitoring,com-pliance,and auditing.Some activities startwith indirect objectives,build internalcapacity and external trust,and then ven-ture into more dif\ufb01cult areas.The impact ofthese initiatives varies according to howthey are perceived by politicians and policy-makers and the government\u2019s receptivity tochange.Several studies link this receptivityto the stock ofsocial capital.260One concern with some citizen initiativesis that they can lead to con\ufb02icts ofinterestand reduced accountability to poor people.Facing funding uncertainties,many non-governmental organizations seek to diversify,starting from voice activities but moving onto actual service delivery.When they becomeadvocates and providers at the same time,there can be intrinsic con\ufb02icts ofinterest.261NGOs may suffer from their own lack ofaccountability,internal democratic de\ufb01cits,and gaps in their mandates.262The award oflarge service delivery contracts to a few bigcivil society organizations can exclude andspell \ufb01nancial dif\ufb01culties for smaller organi-zations.263And ifcommunity and civicgroups are captured by unscrupulous leaders,they can manipulate funding agencies andbene\ufb01ciaries for their own gain.264Information strategies to strengthen voice Policies that increase information and coor-dination in voting,enhance the credibility ofpolitical promises,and increase the ability ofcivil society organizations to hold politiciansThe budget,a primary statement of governmentpriorities,is for many citizens a black box,moni-tored and assessed only by the traditional inter-nal accountability relationships within govern-ment.But it can be a crucial tool for citizens toin\ufb02uence and monitor public policy and ser-vices.Accordingly,participatory budgeting ini-tiatives are increasing rapidly in several coun-tries.The challenge is to build the capacity ofcitizen groups,to give politicians and policy-makers the incentives to listen and act on citi-zen feedback,and to put out budgets that areunderstandable and interesting to citizens.Budget planningThe most well-knownbudget planning initiatives come from citymunicipalities in Brazil,such as Porto Alegre andBelo Horizonte.Neighborhoods indicate theirspending needs at budget forums,and delegatesthen bring these needs to assemblies,ensuringcitizen voice in budget allocations andimplementation.Budget monitoringThe Institute for aDemocratic South Africa makes informationabout provincial and national budgetallocations accessible to citizens.Its technicalexperts break public budgets down to facilitatepublic comment.Special reports show howmuch money is allocated,say,to gender-relatedand children\u2019s issues.The most direct in\ufb02uenceof its work is in strengthening the ability ofparliamentarians to participate more effectivelyin budget discussions.Budget auditingThe Mazdoor Kisan ShaktiSanghathan (MKSS),a grassroots organization inthe north Indian state of Rajasthan,has turnedordinary citizens into \ufb01nancial auditors.Its keyinnovation has been the jan sunwai(or publichearing),an open-air forum at which of\ufb01cialrecords are presented alongside the testimonyderived from interviews with local people.\u201cMany people discovered that they had beenlisted as bene\ufb01ciaries of anti-poverty schemes,though they had never received payment.Others were astonished to learn of largepayments to local building contractors for workthat was never performed\u201d(Jenkins and Goetz1999).Until a state right-to-information law waspassed in 2000\u2014largely a result of the protestand lobbying efforts of the MKSS\u2014its activistshad to obtain this information by appealing tosympathetic bureaucrats.A similar national lawwas

people.Conversely,the lack oftransparency in information dis-closure can come at a high price.Cases dur-ing the earliest phase ofthe outbreak ofSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome in mid-November 2002 in China were not openlyreported,which allowed a new and severedisease to become silently established in waysthat made further spread almost inevitable.265Information campaigns have dramaticallyaltered the behavior ofpoliticians and policy-makers,but many have also failed to inducechange.Understanding when informationcampaigns can succeed is thus critical.What makes for a successfulinformation strategy?Tracer studies ofspending on Ugandan edu-cation revealed leakages as high as 90 per-cent.Once the information was publicized,the budgeted resources reaching schoolsrose dramatically.266Studies suggest thatnewspaper readership and availability inIndia spur state governments to respond tofood crises.267In Buenos Aires,publishingthe wildly different procurement prices paidby city hospitals for similar products led torapid convergence ofprices.268What didthese information strategies have in com-mon?", u"['SDG_4', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_11']The information was speci\ufb01c.Politicalinterest in addressing the problem was high.And the information was electorally salient.Speci\ufb01c information.The informationidenti\ufb01ed speci\ufb01c government decisions,spe-ci\ufb01c decisionmakers,and the effect ofthedecision on the voters individually or as agroup.That made benchmarking\u2014system-atic comparisons across time or space\u2014easy.The Uganda information was not about thegeneral quality ofeducation or general budgetsupport,or even about leakage from nationaleducation budgets.It was about one type oftransfer\u2014capitation grants\u2014disaggregatedto the school level,responsibility for whichwas easy for parents and voters to assign to theschool principal.In addition,the informationmade clear to voters what the school shouldhave received.The information in BuenosAires was also speci\ufb01c to individual hospitals.Government responses to food crisesshow how the provision ofhigh-level infor-mation is politically enforceable by voters.First,a food crisis is a single,speci\ufb01c issue.Second,responsibility for it is known to restultimately in the state chiefminister\u2019s of\ufb01ce.Third,there are no complicated issues ofquality measurement\u2014voters know imme-diately that they are bene\ufb01ting ifthey receiveassistance.Benchmarking is a bit more com-plicated but still doable.Voters know ifoth-ers less deserving receive assistance.But theydo not know what effort governmentsshould make in responding to food crises(which is different from the benchmarks inthe Uganda tracer studies,where votersknew exactly how much money should havereached individual schools).269Strong political or bureaucratic interest incorrecting the problem.In some cases(Uganda and possibly Buenos Aires),national politicians did not bene\ufb01t,andpotentially lost,from leakages or inef\ufb01cien-cies.That is,corruption was the product ofKarnataka state in India has pioneered Bhoomi(meaning land),a computerized land record sys-tem serving 6.7 million rural clients.Its mainfunction is to maintain records of rights,tenancy,and cultivation\u2014crucial for transferringor inheriting land and obtaining loans.Startedin 1991 as a pilot,the Bhoomi system now haskiosks in each of the state\u2019s 177 subdistricts,ser-vicing some 30,000 villages.Under the old system,applicants faced longdelays (3\u201330 days),and nearly two out of threeclients paid a bribe\u201470 percent paid more thanRs.100 (the of\ufb01cial service fee was Rs.2).Therewas little transparency in record maintenance\u2014the village accountant controlled the process,with little of\ufb01cial or client monitoring.Evenwhere there was no fraud,the record systemcould not easily handle the division of land intovery small lots over generations.Farmers can now get these records in 5\u201330minutes and \ufb01le for changes at a Bhoomi kiosk.The entire process takes place in the vernacular,Kannada.Clients can watch a second computerscreen facing them as their request is processed.Users pay a fee of Rs.15.In a recent evaluation,only 3 percent of users reported paying a bribe.The evaluation estimates that on averageBhoomi annually saves clients 1.32 million workdays in waiting time and (net of the higher userfee) Rs.806 million in bribesThe resistance of village accountants had tobe overcome in implementing Bhoomi.Thechief minister,revenue minister,and members ofthe legislature championed Bhoomi,whichhelped.There are now plans to expand beyondland transactions.The Indian government hassuggested that other states consider similar sys-tems to improve accountability and ef\ufb01ciency inservices that are vital to rural households.Sources:World Bank staff and Lobo and Balakrish-nan (2002).BOX 5.5Down

DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004bureaucratic shirking rather than politicalrent-seeking.Education had become amajor issue for the president ofUganda,and his reputation was on the line.He hadmade public promises,followed by thehighly visible action oftransferring morefunds to local schools.His ability to ful\ufb01llthose promises was being undermined bybureaucratic malfeasance.Once the malfea-sance was revealed,the fear ofsanctions wasenough to hold individual bureaucratsaccountable and produce rapid change.In other cases,such as assistance in afood crisis,there is considerably more roomfor shirking.Citizens \ufb01nd it dif\ufb01cult toknow how large the crisis is,what resourcesare available,and how ef\ufb01ciently and equi-tably the resources are distributed.Thisuncertainty leaves room for political inac-tion.But the consequences ofgovernmentinaction\u2014starvation deaths and theirreports in the media\u2014are grave enough totarnish the chiefexecutive\u2019s reputation,which gives the state administration amajor reason to avoid them.Famines donot occur in democratic countries,evenvery poor ones,because the survival ofthegovernment would be threatened by theopposition and by newspapers and othermedia.270And the more citizens areinformed about the crisis and the neededresponse,the more likely they are to holdpoliticians electorally accountable.The issue is important electorally.Politi-cians are not interested in improving perfor-mance ifvoters do not care.Voters can bewell informed and know who the responsi-ble politician is,but still not hold the politi-cian accountable because other issues loomlarger.Where con\ufb02ict is rife,or society ispolarized,the politician\u2019s stance on con\ufb02ictor polarization may dominate voter atten-tion,allowing the politician to get away withpoor performance on other issues.InUganda,the president made education acentral part ofhis election manifesto.InBuenos Aires,municipal politicians mayhave been concerned that voters would viewthe corruption in hospitals as indicative ofdeeper problems ofmalfeasance,in the citygovernment and,because Buenos Aires isthe capital,in other cities and the country.Citizen report cards: information as political actionOther information strategies look directly atpublic service outputs (quality and quantityofservices provided by government) ratherthan inputs (prices paid,budgets committedand delivered).The best known are the citi-zen report cards developed by the PublicAffairs Centre in Bangalore,India.271Citi-zens are asked to rate service access and qual-ity and to report on corruption and generalgrievances about public services.Citizenreport cards have spread to cities in thePhilippines,Ukraine,and,on a pilot basis,Vietnam.They have recently been scaled upin India to cover urban and rural services in24 states.272The results have stimulated con-siderable media,bureaucratic,and politicalattention and acknowledgment oftheir con-tribution to service improvements.Because citizen report cards focus on ser-vice outcomes,they do not provide voters withinformation about speci\ufb01c decisions that spe-ci\ufb01c policymakers have made\u2014or not made.Nor do they give voters information (at least intheir \ufb01rst round) about service benchmarks,except to the extent that the agencies them-selves have established service standards(repeat report cards do provide implicit bench-marks from the previous report card).So it canbe hard for voters to assess,on the basis ofonereport card,whether the results justify votingagainst the incumbents at the next election.Report cards seem to have had a moredirect in\ufb02uence on the heads and senior man-agers ofthe municipal and utility agenciesresponsible for services,as in Bangalore.Thehigh visibility ofreport cards in the press andcivic forums turns them into league tables ofthe ef\ufb01cacy ofmunicipal agencies.The repu-tational competition arising from the reportcards is enhanced by joint agency meetings onthe report cards attended by prominent socialand political leaders and citizens.But report cards clearly also perform apolitical function.Politicians can ignore poorpublic services ifthey believe that voters can-not penalize them for poor performance.Or ifthey believe that a political challenger cannotcredibly promise voters better performance.An NGO conducting broad surveys and issu-ing report cards on public services changesthe equation.Now incumbent politicians are11_WDR_Ch05.qxd  8/14/03  8:40 AM  Page 88\x0c(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank\n\nCitizens and politicians89confronted by an organized effort to improvepublic service delivery,which creates a latentpolitical force that is credible because there isno obvious personal gain to members oftheNGO.The information that the NGO gener-ates and disseminates is a political challenge,both because ofthe demonstrated underlyingability to mobilize citizens to answer a surveyand the power ofthat information in thehands ofinformed voters.Some implications for information strategiesThese examples show that pure informationstrategies work in fairly speci\ufb01c circum-stances.But many information strategies arenot designed around the speci\ufb01cs ofa partic-ular country or service.Information aboutbroad aggregates ofpublic sector perfor-mance\u2014whether based on surveys,budgetstudies,or other methods\u2014is less likely to beas politically relevant.Why?", u"['SDG_3', 'SDG_4', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_16']Or should technicalproviders be strengthened and the \u201cpartici-patory\u201drole be channeled not into directcontrol and decisionmaking but into elect-ing local of\ufb01cials?Local or regional governments.Regionalgovernments often complain that movingresources directly to communities under-mines their authority,slowing the capacitybuilding needed for formal governance anddemocracy.Proponents ofcommunitydevelopment respond that deep democracydepends on the kinds oftransparency,deci-sionmaking,open debate,and accountabil-ity that community projects build.Decen-tralizing decisions about budgets andprograms to the provincial level\u2014whenpeople have not developed traditions andinstitutions ofcivic decisionmaking at thelocal level (or have had them suppressed)\u2014is risky business.In a transitional environ-ment,periodic elections alone are unlikelyto be suf\ufb01cient for public accountability.The development ofnonelectoral mecha-nisms ofpublic accountability (trans-parency,legal recourses,direct participa-tion) is key.Spotlight on the Kecamatan Development Program9312_pgs 92-94_Ch05Spotlights.qxd 8/14/03 3:18 PM Page 93\x0c(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and

and philanthropic organizations.As the state took on more responsibility fordelivering universal services,a process thatpicked up in the 1930s,it did not have to buildthe institutions from scratch:it could build oninstitutions already built,organized,and\ufb01nanced by private actors and civil society.Reforming schoolsFrom 1739,children were required toattend school from the age ofseven untilthey could read and undergo Lutheran con-\ufb01rmation.The incentives to learn to readwere strong.No reading meant no con\ufb01r-mation,and no con\ufb01rmation meant nomarriage license,no land holding,no per-manent job,and no chance ofenlisting inthe armed forces.Nevertheless,the ruralpopulation resisted sending their childrento school,mainly because they found thecurriculum irrelevant for farming.As with health,formally trained teachersbecame the driving force behind using edu-cation to build the Norwegian nation.Teachers organized themselves in 1848 andadvocated inclusion ofeducation profes-sionals in policymaking bodies.The SchoolAct of1860 shifted responsibility for run-ning schools from the clergy to an electedschool board (whose head would still be apriest).As a result ofpopulist and agrarianpressure,local school councils were able toappoint teachers,determine their own\u201ceducation plan,\u201dand introduce New Norseas the language ofinstruction.But a grow-ing labor movement was demanding moreuniversal education,so that by 1889 a com-mon school law was passed and education\ufb01nally moved from religious training togeneral learning and nation building.Norway:gradual change with top-down pressureIn 1860 the Norwegian national assemblypassed two laws\u2014the Health Act and theSchool Act\u2014the \ufb01rst time the state tookresponsibility for the health and education ofits people.The Health Act,which establishedhealth commissions in every municipality,was promoted by the country\u2019s social elite toimprove the welfare ofNorway\u2019s farming andpeasant communities so that the countrycould compete with the more advancednations ofEurope.The elite saw educatingpoor rural households in personal and envi-ronmental hygiene as a key to this project,and the health commissions were chargedwith this task.Interestingly,members ofthemedical profession,which up to that pointhad a somewhat lower status than other pro-fessions (lawyers,priests,and the military),saw themselves as the natural leaders ofthecampaign.According to one doctor,appoint-ing a lawyer to head the campaign (some-thing that was being contemplated) \u201cwoulddo nothing to further the cause.\u201d280But the health commissions faced sig-ni\ufb01cant dif\ufb01culties in getting their jobdone.In addition to the facts that doctorswere not trained in public health and theirwork was poorly paid,the cultural dividebetween the urban elites and rural farmerswas an obstacle.For instance,although fer-tilizer was a scarce commodity,the doctorswere trying to get rid ofthe compost heapsnear people\u2019s houses because ofthe \u201crotten\u201dair that people were obliged to breathe.Meanwhile,many ofthe services werebeing delivered by grassroots organizations.Founded in 1896,the Norwegian Women\u2019sPublic Health Association was running 14sanatoria for patients with tuberculosis by1920.The Association also advocated forgreater public intervention in health,gettingthe authorities to open public baths and regu-Estonia:starting over,with fewresourcesAt re-independence in 1991,Estonia wantedto move away from its inherited systems tomodern Western European approaches thatrested on progressive governmental,eco-nomic,and social reforms\u2014partly for accep-tance into the European Union.The newstate had to quickly establish the mechanismsofa modern welfare system.But there was lit-tle time to establish the system\u2019s legitimacy.The \ufb01rst priority in 1991 was servicesbased on Estonian language and culture,critical for national identity.Then came theurgent need to improve ef\ufb01ciency andequity.But economic dif\ufb01culties limited theresources for reform.The health care system had to be com-pletely reorganized.Unlike the situation inNorway,the administrative,legislative,andregulatory powers in Estonia were all in oneplace:the Ministry ofHealth.With littletransparency and control,corruption \ufb02our-ished.To address the problem,the old state-funded system was replaced by healthinsurance,which facilitated transparencyand a steady stream of\ufb01nance.A majorchallenge has been to convey the logic andlong-term advantages ofthe new system.People suddenly had to pay for health carethat used to be free.Drugs were sold atEuropean prices.And,although the systemhas equity as a goal,the health status ofagrowing number ofEstonians is declining,especially that ofthe elderly,ethnic minori-ties,and the unemployed.Around 6 percentofthe population is not yet covered by thenew national health insurance system.On many accounts,Estonia has suc-ceeded more than many other newly inde-pendent countries.But in seeking to \ufb01nd itsown way ofmaking services work,it has nothad the luxury oftime.Developing social services and building a nationOne ofthe richest countries in the world,Norway today is the quintessential welfare state,with universal access to basichealth and education.But

as precisely astons ofsteel.But the outcomes ofthese ser-vices are far more amenable to measurementthan many core functions ofgovernment.Mortality rates,literacy rates,and the purityofwater are observable in ways that \u201cadvanc-ing the international interests ofthe nation,\u201dthe goal ofa foreign ministry for example,are not.282And technical knowledge forrigorous evaluation ofprograms to reachthe poor is certainly available.A word on \u201ccompacts\u201dversus \u201cmanage-ment.\u201dThe focus ofthis chapter is the com-pact between the policymaker and theprovider organizations,not the details ofthemanagement offrontline providers by aprovider organization.Appropriate manage-ment needs to be tailored to local circum-stances.Focusing on the details ofmanage-ment detracts from the more crucialrelationship ofthe compact and indulges thetendency to micromanage.Here the empha-sis is on the principles for designing incen-tives.But management cannot be ignoredentirely.Much ofthe (very thin) literature onwhat works and what doesn\u2019t\u2014on providerresponses to changes in incentives\u2014dealswith management reforms,so these experi-ences must form the limited empirical base.Misaligned incentives and service failuresFailures to reach poor people with effectiveservices can usually be attributed to a mis-alignment between the incentives facingproviders and outcomes.A private marketleft to itselfcannot provide appropriate ser-vices to poor people.It will tend to serveclients who possess the purchasing power fora fairly narrow set ofservices.Modern,pri-vate medical care by skilled professionals andprivate education are largely used by the bet-ter off.Water is an exception,with substantialmiddle-class capture ofpublic water,leavingpoor people to buy from expensive privatesellers.The range ofservices the private sec-tor will provide on its own is limited to,well,private goods.Private providers may be con-tracted by the public sector for services topoor people or for true public goods (where aprivate sector is impossible,even in princi-ple).But they cannot be relied on to providethem on their own.That is why the publicsector should assume responsibility for basicservices,especially for poor people.The public sector has its problems,too.Chapter 5 asked whether,in ful\ufb01lling thisresponsibility,policymakers have the incen-tive to \u201cdo the right thing.\u201dThe answer isoften \u201cno.\u201dBut even ifpolicies are properlydesigned,it is dif\ufb01cult to get personnel tostafffacilities in poor or remote areas.Vacancy rates for doctors in Indonesia rangefrom near zero in Bali to as high as 60 percentin West Papua (formerly Irian Jaya),theprovince farthest from Java (box 6.1).The dif\ufb01culty in staf\ufb01ng such places variesby job.It is greatest for the most highly edu-cated people with the best alternativeemployment prospects.Educated people incountries with few such people are almostalways urban born and bred.In

for their chil-dren.And it is na\xefve to simply say \u201cpay themmore.\u201dDoctors in Indonesia would requiremultiples ofcurrent pay levels to live in WestPapua.284And giving providers too much dis-cretion over where they serve may hurt thepoor,as in rural schools in Zambia (box 6.2).Even when people accept jobs in poorareas,their absenteeism is often astonishing(see tables 1.2 and 1.3 in chapter 1).The rea-sons vary,but alternative earning opportu-nities are a major one for professions witheasily marketable skills.285This applies todoctors and other medical personnel and toteachers offering independent tutoring.Again,the day-to-day imperatives for peopleto make a living run counter to increasingservices to poor people.This is particularlytrue where civil service pay is much lessthan private sector pay for the same skills.Even when people are on the job,theirperformance can compromise the outcomesfor poor people.The lack ofconscientious-ness,the mistreatment ofstudents andpatients,and the loss ofskills with time(chapter 1)\u2014all can be attributed to a com-bination ofthe failure ofincentives and aservice ethos.Salaried workers with noopportunity to advance and no fear ofpun-ishment have little incentive to perform well.Chapter 4 argued that discourtesy dependedon incentives,not training.Ifincome doesnot come from clients,the policymaker musthold providers accountable,particularly inmonitoring and rewarding good behavior.Corruption\u2014unauthorized private gainfrom public resources\u2014is common in manyservices and also attributable to competingincentives.In Eastern Europe under-the-tablepayments to public servants and general cor-ruption undermine the legitimacy ofall gov-ernment services.They are particularly costlyto poor people (box 6.3).Pharmaceuticalmismanagement is everywhere:thefts frompublic stores supply much ofthe private mar-ket in C\xf4te d\u2019Ivoire,India,Jordan,Thailand,and Zambia.Corruption responds to mone-tary incentives,but it also requires a lack ofinformation on hidden activities and aninability to impose sanctions.As CaptainShotover in George Bernard Shaw\u2019s Heart-break Houseput it,\u201cGive me deeper darkness.Money is not made in the light.\u201dOpen infor-mation can reduce both the incidence ofcor-ruption and its corrosiveness.286Community pressure can also subvertthe incentives to ful\ufb01ll the primary respon-sibilities ofpublic providers.In many placesthe public servant is a permanent memberofthe community,facing substantial socialpressures to bend rules to the bene\ufb01t oflocal preferences.Sometimes this is good\u2014it shows the \ufb02exibility to respond to localneeds.But for some services,particularlythose with punitive characteristics,it cancompromise the core duties ofthe provider.For example,forestry agents who are part ofa community may be reluctant to reportillegal logging by their neighbors.287A formofcommunity pressure particularly harm-ful to the poor is the capture ofservices bylocal elites.In Northern Ghana young,inex-perienced,and poorly paid facilitators forparticipatory projects found such pressure amajor impediment.288Rural schools in Zambia obtain resources incash and in kind (personnel).Cash transfersallocated by strict rules of per capita fundingare distinctly progressive.Rural areas give sig-ni\ufb01cantly higher discretionary cash allocationsto rich schools.Per-pupil teacher compensa-tion increases with the wealth of childrenattending the school,re\ufb02ecting higher staf\ufb01ngratios and the gravitation of

the pub-lic good.But their own needs oflooking aftera family,ensuring their well being,havingfriendly relations with neighbors\u2014all pre-vent them from providing suf\ufb01cient servicesto bene\ufb01t poor people.Ifthe scale ofopera-tions needs to be increased to reach the poor,even more incentives need to be changed atthe margin,whether monetary or not.289Increasing accountability:separating the policymaker from the providerThe many incentives that providers face blurthe focus on outcomes.Making a clear sepa-ration between the role ofthe policymakerand the provider organization is essential foraligning the incentives for the provider withthe \ufb01nal outcomes that policymakers wantfor citizens.Who is the policymaker,and whois the provider organization?", u"['SDG_3', 'SDG_4', 'SDG_6', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_11']That is,why can\u2019t out-puts just be speci\ufb01ed and paid for accordingly?Limits to accountabilityAll public services face three problems thatmake this solution impossible:providersface multiple principals,undertake multipletasks,and produce outcomes that are hardto observe and hard to attribute to theiractions.291Multiple principalsThe instructions ofthe policymaker toproviders are not the only ones that count.Public servants have to serve many masters.Education providers are under pressurefrom parents ofpoor children (with thepolicymaker representing them),parents ofchildren other than the poor,teachers\u2019unions,potential employers,various groupsin society that want (or don\u2019t want) particu-lar items on the curriculum,and others.Power and water providers are under pres-sure from different segments ofthe marketto cross-subsidize them,from producers tobuy speci\ufb01c types ofequipment,from peo-ple who want more extensive connections,and from others who want more reliable,continuous operation.The day-to-day pres-sure oflocal demand for health care cancompromise efforts in disease preventionand other public health activities that arenot demand-driven.292Whom is a providerto listen to?Although the state pays for health care inmost Organisation for Economic Co-opera-tion and Development (OECD) countries,private practitioners still provide it (excep-tions on the \ufb01nance side include the UnitedStates;exceptions on the provision side,theUnited Kingdom).The state carries out theinsurance function in these countries butnot the services.It is the insurance marketthat is hampered by severe market failure.In Germany,the current system is a consoli-dation,begun under Bismarck in 1883,of asystem of guild-based insurance schemes.For most OECD countries,the currentsystem of public ownership or controldates from a time after World War II whenthey had incomes at least as high as theupper-middle-income countries today.Before these programs were brought underpublic management,the state already hadregulatory powers over the medical profes-sion.The timing was fortuitous since it wasonly in the 20th century that technicalchanges in medicine made publicoversight essential.Universal public education is also fairlyrecent.It came out of a con\ufb02ict betweenchurch and state.In the period of expansionof public facilities,the main mechanism wasincorporating private schools into the pub-lic network after a system of managing indi-vidual schools had already developed.Even the core networked services ofwater,electricity,gas,and railways\u2014servicesnow thought of as natural monopolies\u2014began as purely private activities.In theUnited Kingdom early water systems weresometimes developed with duplicate pipeslaid by competing \ufb01rms.Only after cover-age was substantial were theserationalized\u2014and then for reasons of pub-lic health rather than duplication.Germanrailways also began with duplicate lines.Inother cases,companies worked out agree-ments that divided markets without theduplication experienced in the railway mar-kets in the United States and England\u2014forexample,bus systems in many large urbanareas and German natural gas transport.These were then brought under a regula-tory regime but only after reaching quitehigh service penetration.In each of these cases the independentregulatory capacity of the policymaker pre-ceded the incorporation of privateproviders into a public system.Source:Klein and Roger (1994).BOX

tasksPersonnel in health clinics are supposed toprovide curative care to people who come tothem.They are also to provide immuniza-tions,health education,and other preventivemeasures to everyone,whether they come inon their own or not.And they are to keepstatistics,attend training sessions and meet-ings,and do inspections ofwater and food.Police of\ufb01cers have to deal with everyonefrom lost children to dangerous criminals.They are,at various times,investigators ofcrimes,social workers intervening in neigh-borhood and family disputes,and dissemi-nators ofinformation.This diffusion natu-rally blunts the precision ofincentives.Measuring and attributingoutcomesThe most dif\ufb01cult problems,particularly forthe social sectors,are the dual problems ofmeasuring outcomes and attributing theseoutcomes to the actions ofproviders.Testscores may adequately re\ufb02ect certain educa-tional goals,but abstract thinking and socialadaptability are not so easily measured.Thealleviation ofpain is a subjective judgmentofthe patient.Many outcomes,even whenobservable to the patient and the doctor,arenot \u201ccontractible\u201din the sense that,ifa dis-pute arises,compliance can be proved to ajudge or other mediator.And attributingimpacts to provider actions is dif\ufb01cult inalmost all social services.These problems make it impossible to haveperformance contracts that make payments toindividual frontline providers depend on out-comes.All contracts will necessarily beincomplete,requiring at least some paymentofwages independent ofoutputs.When theactions ofthe provider are speci\ufb01ed in greatdetail,the results are often less than optimalbecause ofin\ufb02exible response to local varia-tion.The impossibility ofspecifying suchrules ahead oftime is illustrated by \u201cwork-to-rule\u201dstrikes,in which strikers bring an activityto a \u201cgrinding halt\u201dby following rules entirelyto the letter (box 6.5).The balance betweencontrol and \ufb02exibility is not easily struck.Further,since the provider does manythings,some or all ofthem hard to observe bythe policymaker,there is the ever-present riskthat payments for measured outcomes willdisplace hard-to-measure tasks (box 6.6).This risk has been discussed in the educationliterature as \u201cteaching to the test.\u201dWhenteacher compensation (pay or promotionprospect) is measured by students\u2019perfor-mance on a standard test,there will be a ten-dency to downplay those aspects ofpedagogynot covered by the test and to concentrate onthose that are.In Kenya teachers manipulatedtest scores by offering tutoring sessions aimedspeci\ufb01cally at these tests.There was noimprovement in other indicators ofquality,such as homework assignments,teacherabsences,or teaching methods.293Several industrial countries,in reformingthe civil service or other providers ofpublicservices,have tried to use performance con-tracts.The evidence ofsuccess is mixed:294many problems are tied to the dependence ofthe policymaker on information the agencyprovides\u2014a problem closely related to theregulation ofprivate \ufb01rms.Some informa-tion used for performance contracts can beeasily falsi\ufb01ed or,less pejoratively,presentedin too favorable a light.For example,wheneducation reforms were instituted in theUnited Kingdom,truancies were rede\ufb01ned asexcused absences.295Overcoming the limitsSeparating policymakers from provider orga-nizations can help sharpen incentives to helppoor people.Assigning policymakers the roleofdevising a compact for the provider orga-nization and assigning provider organiza-tions the responsibility ofmanagement can\u201cAnyone who has worked in a formal orga-nization\u2014even a small one strictlygoverned by detailed rules\u2014knows thathandbooks and written guidelines failutterly in explaining how the institutiongoes about its work.Accounting for itssmooth operation are nearly endless andshifting sets of implicit understandings,tacit coordinations,and practical mutuali-ties that could never be successfullycaptured in a written code.This ubiquitoussocial fact is useful to employees and laborunions.The premise behind what aretellingly called work-to-rule strikes is a casein point.When Parisian taxi drivers want topress a point on the municipal authoritiesabout regulations or fees,they sometimeslaunch a work-to-rule strike.It consistsmerely in following meticulously all the reg-ulations in the Code routier and therebybringing traf\ufb01c throughout central Paris to agrinding halt.The drivers thus take tacticaladvantage of the fact that the circulation oftraf\ufb01c is possible only because drivers havemastered a set of practices that haveevolved outside,and often in contravention,of the formal rules.\u201dSource:Scott (1998).BOX 6.5Be careful what you wish for\u2014part 113_WDR_Ch06.qxd  8/14/03  9:09 AM  Page 100\x0c(c) The International

policymaker representingthe poor,for the following three reasons.First,policymakers,balancing political pres-sures,can help insulate providers from theproblem ofsatisfying masters with con\ufb02ict-ing aims and offer unambiguous instruc-tions.Second,provider organizations canface performance-based payments whenindividuals cannot.Third,managers oftheprovider organizations,ifthey have \ufb02exibilityover operational decisions,can supervise staffand choose the appropriate form ofremu-neration that best re\ufb02ects local conditions.Insulating providers from politicsThat providers have to satisfy many mastersre\ufb02ects the inability ofgovernment to insu-late them from political pressures.While pol-icymakers for education need to addressconcerns ofpotential employers,teachers\u2019unions,or interest groups who want to in\ufb02u-ence curricula,there is no reason why thisshould affect day-to-day activities in aschool,or indeed any organization offront-line providers.Ifthe policymaking functioncan be separated from the provider organiza-tion,the policymaker can handle the politicsofthe overall objectives ofeducation whilethe provider can be given more preciseinstructions and be held accountable to thepolicymaker.Poor people might legitimatelydelegate to policymakers curriculum devel-opment as well as the responsibility to bal-ance their interests with those ofunions.Organizations and individualsIndividual providers will not accept perfor-mance contracts that leave them exposed toexcessive risk.But the variability ofaggregateperformance over all providers in an organi-zation\u2014say,those dealing with infant mor-tality for a district\u2014is very much smaller,which provides a way ofsharing the risk.While a single doctor may not be able toabsorb the risk to income ofthe bad luck ofany particular patient,a district health boardwould.Teams\u2014schools,school districts,health boards,city police departments\u2014canbe the recipients ofperformance-basedincentives where teachers,nurses,and police-men cannot (see spotlight on Costa Rica andCuba).What can be considered measurablevaries by the size ofthe organization\u2014largerones being easier to hold to account.The problem ofmultiple tasks is partly aproblem ofeconomies ofscale as well.Sometasks can be divided into groups ofcomple-mentary activities\u2014all immunizations as agroup,say,or all health education activitiesbased on home visits (chapter 8).Then afairly homogeneous organization can becharged with the responsibility to carry out asimpler set oftasks,with clear standards ofaccountability.Reform in Johannesburg,South Africa(see spotlight),was in large part a reevalua-tion ofthe appropriate set ofservices to begrouped together to deliver speci\ufb01ed outputs.Departments were reorganized so that theiroutputs were clearly identi\ufb01able and veri\ufb01-able,with the department\u2019s CEO able toretain any savings over contract expenditures.At one extreme,commercial enterprises\u2014such as the athletics stadium,the airport,andmetro gas\u2014were simply sold to the privatesector and directly faced the forces ofthemarket,where payment is very much depen-dent on outcomes.296Management \ufb02exibilityEach ofthese potential effects depends onmanagers in provider organizations having the\ufb02exibility and authority to design the incen-tives for the frontline providers in their organi-zations.This allows them to adapt to local (orsectoral) variation to see whether performancepay or salaries with supervision works better.Flexibility for the manager is essential,a majorpart of\u201cinstitutional capacity.\u201dManagers musthave control over the pay scheme or the sanc-tions for poor performance.Salaried systems work as long as there

claims on gov-ernment.Including government\u2019s ability toimplement\u2014that is,the degree ofgovern-ment failure to be expected\u2014can lead to asubstantial re-ranking ofpublic policiesrelative to conventional analyses.Forsocial security systems,for example,thereis no particular reason on conventionaleconomic grounds for the public sector tosend out checks to pensioners.But manygovernments with well-developed admin-istrative procedures do it quite well,andthere is no compelling reason to change\u2014market failures are not terrible but neitheris it hard for government to do.Much ofthe controversy about whether rich coun-tries should emulate New Zealand\u2019sreforms surrounds this point.New inno-vations in contracting with a private sec-tor or with a government agency mightimprove the functioning ofgovernmentsomewhat.But ifgovernment is alreadydoing tasks acceptably,the gains may besmall and possibly not worth the disrup-tion caused by the change itself.When applied to the health sector somestandard prescriptions are reinforced bythese considerations while others are chal-lenged.The provision oftraditional publichealth services,such as pest control to pre-vent infectious disease,is relatively easy tocarry out.But staf\ufb01ng and maintaining alarge network ofprimary health centers inremote areas is often hard to do,eventhough the redistribution effects arepotentially bene\ufb01cial.It might be wiser,until government capabilities improve,totry to get poor people to government facil-ities,even to much maligned hospitals,than get facilities to poor people.Not onlywould this address a serious market fail-ure,the absence ofinsurance for expensivecare,but it will be easier to implementsince working in less remote areas is moreconsistent with providers\u2019interests andeasier to monitor,with a smaller numberoflarger facilities.308Scaling up,scaling back,and wising upThere is no \u201cright\u201dway to make sure servicesreach poor people.The appropriate technicalinterventions\u2014and the institutional struc-tures that generate them\u2014vary enormously.Education was expanded dramatically inChile by markets and vouchers,in Cuba by acentral ministry,and in El Salvador by localschool committees.Beyond trial and error,scaling up means watching what you\u2019redoing,evaluating whether it works,deter-mining why it works or doesn\u2019t,replicatingsuccess,and evaluating the replications aswell.Sometimes things work for idiosyn-cratic reasons\u2014a charismatic (and literallyirreplaceable) leader or a particular (andunrepeatable) crisis that solidi\ufb01es support fora politically dif\ufb01cult innovation.So one-timesuccesses may not be replicable.Experimen-tation,with real learning from the experi-ments,is the only way to match appropriatepolicies with each country\u2019s circumstances.Scaling up also means scaling back\u2014abandoning failures unless a good,remedia-ble reason for failure is found.Abandoningfailures is harder than it sounds.Simplyadmitting failure is hard enough,particularlyfor politicians.But with the severe resourceconstraints in developing countries\u2014theyare poor after all\u2014badly performing pro-grams are simply unaffordable.Where pro-grams are intensive in management (andauditors and managerial talent are scarce) orintensive in trained personnel (and teachersand doctors are scarce),states need to let goofprograms that are not working and \ufb01ndalternative ways to achieve better outcomes.Ifthe political will exists,the key to scalingup is information.Beyond evaluating pro-grams and projects,a continuing focus onmaking services work for poor people\u2014edu-cated children,better health,reliable water,lighted homes,safer streets\u2014depends on thecontinuing measurement ofprogress towardthese goals.\u201cWhat gets measured is whatcounts.\u201dThis focus on outcomes helps poli-cymakers choose the best options for servingpoor people.It helps the providers knowwhen they are doing a good job.And it helpsclients judge the performance ofboth.13_WDR_Ch06.qxd  8/14/03  9:13 AM  Page 108\x0c(c) The International Bank

experiment,all districts had achievedtheir contractual obligations for most ofthe evaluation indicators.312The use ofhealth services among the poorest halfofthe populace increased by nearly 30 per-centage points in the contracted-out dis-trict (\ufb01gure 1).One possible explanation isthat the contracted-out districts did notcharge of\ufb01cial user fees;they also discour-aged health care workers from taking\u201cunof\ufb01cial\u201duser fees by paying signi\ufb01-cantly higher salaries to providers than inthe other types ofdistricts.The pattern ofincreases is similaracross a variety

Asia.Average life expectancy atbirth was less than 55 years.Infant mortal-ity was 95 per 1,000 live births.And mater-nal mortality was 437 per 100,000 livebirths.309The public health care systemremained rudimentary:average facility usewas 0.35 contacts per person per year,andpatients complained ofvery low quality.Then in 1998 the government con-tracted with nongovernmental entities toprovide health services in several districts.The contracting increased access to healthservices\u2014and not at the expense ofequity.Contracting primary health careservices (in and out)Intervention and control areas consisted ofrandomly selected rural districts,each with100,000 to 200,000 people.310Contractorswere chosen through a competitive processbased on the quality oftheir technical pro-posal and their price.Three approacheswere used.\u2022Contracting out.Contractors had fullresponsibility for the delivery ofspeci-\ufb01ed services in the district,directlyemployed their staff,and had full man-agement control (two districts).\u2022Contracting in.Contractors providedonly management support to civil ser-vice health staff,and recurrent operat-ing costs were provided by the govern-ment through normal governmentchannels (three districts).\u2022Control areas.The usual governmentprovision was retained (four districts).A budget supplement was provided to con-tracted-in and control districts.Performance indicators were measuredfor all the districts by household,and healthfacility surveys,which were conducted in1997 before the experiment.No district hadin contracted-in and control districts.Thereduction was especially marked among thepoor ($35 a year,or 70 percent),indicatingbetter targeting and more ef\ufb01cient transfersofsubsidies.Even though the health ministry encour-aged all districts to implement of\ufb01cial userfees,only one contracted-in district estab-lished a formal user fee system and used thereceipts from the system to reward healthcare workers with monthly performanceand punctuality bonuses.That couldaccount for slightly higher spending for thistype ofdistrict.313There are several possible reasons forthese pro-poor outcomes in the contracteddistricts.\u2022The regular availability ofdrugs and qual-i\ufb01ed staffstrengthened service provisionat health centers in the villages,wheremost poor people are concentrated.\u2022The contracted nongovernmental orga-nizations used a market-based wage andbene\ufb01ts package to attract and retainhealth care providers.\u2022A reduction in the private out-of-pocketcost ofservices and a more predictableand transparent fee structure increasedthe demand for health care services bythe poor.Contracts to improve health services\u2014quicklyCambodia began experimenting with different forms ofcontracting to improve health services in 1998.The lesson\u2014thanks to good evaluation\u2014is that contracting can help increase the coverage ofsome key services in a short time.Cambodiaspotlight on 0ControlContractedinContractedout2520151053035Percent20011997Source: Bhushan, Keller, and Schwartz (2002).Figure 1Percentage of illnesses treated at ahealth facility for

health workers be adequatelycompensated and effectively supervised andsupported.The NGOs working in con-tracted-out districts revised the salaries ofhealth care providers,bringing them in linewith average salaries in the private sector.Inreturn,the NGOs required the providers towork full time in health facilities and tohave no private practice.In the contracted-in districts,the NGOssupplemented provider salaries with their\u2022The availability ofhealth services in vil-lages reduced travel expenditures to seekhealth care,and NGOs enforced rulesagainst informal payments by patients.Agreements on deliverables\u2014and enforceable contractsContracting health services to NGOs canexpand the coverage for poor people.InCambodia it took agreements on deliver-ables and an enforceable contract,which inturn required an independent performanceveri\ufb01cation system.Once targets for 13 keyhealth indicators were agreed on\u2014for poorpeople\u2014progress toward achieving themwas measured through independent house-own funds and,in one district,allocated alarger share ofuser-fee income.The con-trol districts,left to their own devices,allowed workers to pursue private income-maximizing behavior through unof\ufb01cialfees and private practice,to the detrimentofthe public health care services for thepoorest ofthe poor.Transparent and predictable fee struc-tures are important in improving access tohealth services.Of\ufb01cial user charges wereintroduced in only one contracted-in dis-trict,in consultation with communities,toprovide incentives to health workers.Toremove ambiguity about charges,a sched-ule ofuser fees was prominently displayedin all health facilities.This discouraged pri-vate practice and helped bring \u201cunder-the-table\u201dpayments formally into the system.Out-of-pocket spending on health fell inthat district.No user fees were introducedin the other two contracted-in districts,orin the control districts,where out-of-pocketspending did not come down.Contracting health services to NGOscan be dif\ufb01cult for policymakers to accept.But the Cambodian experience shows thatit can be effective and equitable.It helpedconvince policymakers that the modelcould be adopted on a larger scale.They areextending contracting to 11 poor andremote districts,where the public provisionofservices is

inschool and that they learn.This in turn restson education systems that create relation-ships ofaccountability between citizens,politicians,policymakers,and providers,with clear objectives,adequate resources,capable and motivated providers,progressassessments,and performance-orientedmanagements.Successful education systems vary widely.Some systems are centralized,others decen-tralized.Some have almost exclusively pub-lic schools,while others provide public sup-port to private providers.But not justanything goes.\u2022The politics ofschooling\u2014particularlythe effectiveness ofthe voice ofpoorpeople\u2014determines both the school sys-tem\u2019s objectives and the public resourcesthat go to education.\u2022The compact between policymakers andproviders ofschooling needs to balancethe autonomy ofschools and teacherswith performance assessment.\u2022Schools (and school systems) must beenabled to manage for performance\u2014and,particularly,to \ufb01nd effective ways totrain and motivate teachers.\u2022Direct parent and community participa-tion in schools,demand-side inducementsto expand enrollments,and choice\u2014ifcorrectly designed\u2014can be valuable partsofan overall plan for school improvement.Common problems of service provisionEducation systems face the common prob-lems ofservice provision outlined in chap-ter 1\u2014unaffordable access,dysfunctionalschools,low technical quality,low clientresponsiveness,and stagnant productivity.But not all countries face the same prob-lems.In many ofthe poorest countriesthere are enormous de\ufb01cits in affordableaccess.Poor people have less access,lowerattainment,and lower quality than thosebetter off.In many countries public sectorprovision is close to dysfunctional and rifewith corruption.The technical quality ofinstruction and learning outcomes areshockingly low,especially among poor peo-ple.And even the most advanced economiesstruggle to make education systems moreproductive.Shortfalls in universal primary comple-tion\u2014a combined result ofchildren whonever enroll,children who do not progress,and children who drop out\u2014re\ufb02ect the fail-ures in the system.In Madagascar only 52percent of15- to 19-year-olds in the poorest20 percent ofthe population had everenrolled in school,and only 4 percent com-pleted even grade 5 (\ufb01gure 7.1).In Brazil 89percent ofpoor adolescents enrolled ingrade 1,but only 30 percent completedgrade 5 because ofhigh dropout and repeti-tion rates.In Turkey high retention throughprimary school,followed by a sharp drop inprogress to the next level,suggests that sys-temic and institutional solutions arerequired to increase achievement.In Ban-gladesh only 60 percent ofpoor adolescentshave completed grade 1,and only 36 per-cent have completed grade 5.Unaffordable accessDespite at least 55 years ofacknowledgmentthat universal literacy is the heart ofdevelop-ment,and despite repeated rhetorical com-mitments to universal enrollment,even theBasic education services7chapter15_WDR_Ch07.qxd  8/14/03  9:19 AM  Page 111\x0c(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank\n\nmodest goal ofuniversal primary schoolcompletion has not been realized.Somecountries have made huge strides\u2014averagecompletion rates in Brazil expanded from lessthan 50 percent in 1990 to more than 70 per-cent in 2000.But ifcountries continue at onlytheir recent rate ofprogress,universal pri-mary completion would come only after2020 in the Middle East and North Africa,after 2030 in South Asia,and not in the fore-seeable future in Sub-Saharan Africa.In the very poorest countries the attain-ment de\ufb01cit is spread across the population,but in most it is concentrated among chil-dren from poor households.In countrieswith very low attainment,like Mali,most ofthe population is rural,and there are sub-stantial de\ufb01cits in primary completion evenamong relatively wealthier and urban fami-lies.In India the rural poor (poorest 50 per-cent) accounted for 72 percent ofthe de\ufb01citin completion ofgrade 5 among 15- to 19-year-olds,and completion is higher amongboys than girls.In the Philippines the de\ufb01citis much lower,concentrated among therural poor and higher among boys thangirls.Dysfunctional schoolsSchooling completions and learning out-comes may fall short because providers aredysfunctional.While most teachers try con-scientiously to do their jobs,one recent sur-vey found a third ofall teachers in UttarPradesh,India,absent.Cases ofmalfeasanceby teachers are distressingly present in manysettings:teachers show up drunk,are physi-cally abusive,or simply do nothing.This isnot \u201clow-quality\u201dteaching\u2014this is not teach-ing at all.314Low technical qualityThe quality ofinstruction can also be lowbecause oflow capability,weak motivation,and a lack ofcomplementary inputs.Invery-low-income settings learning out-comes can be dismal.The 1994 TanzaniaPrimary School Leavers Examination sug-gested that the vast majority ofstudents hadlearned almost nothingthat was tested intheir seven years ofschooling\u2014more thanfour-\ufb01fths scored less than 13 percent cor-rect in language or mathematics.315InBangladesh 30 percent ofstudents whocompleted grade 5 were not minimallycompetent in reading;70 percent were notminimally competent in writing.316Evidence on learning outcomes is disap-pointing even in middle-income countries.For instance,in the recent Programme forInternational Student Assessment oftheachievement of15-year-olds in school,only5 percent ofBrazilian students reached theOrganisation for Economic Co-operationand Development (OECD) median inmathematical literacy (\ufb01gure 7.2).Fifty-sixpercent ofBrazilian students were at level 1(of5) in reading literacy,compared with 18percent for students in OECD countries.Only 4 percent reached pro\ufb01ciency levels of4 or 5,compared with 31 percent for OECDstudents.317This is not to single out Brazilfor poor performance:Brazil is widely rec-ognized for its advances,and its willingnessto participate in the study and its courage inreleasing the results demonstrate a strongcommitment to education outcomes (othercountries have participated in examinationsand then refused to disclose the results).Inaddition,in an earlier comparison of11Latin American countries Brazil was tiedwith Argentina for second place in themathematics performance of4th graders.Low client responsivenessWhen communities are not involved inestablishing,supporting,or overseeing aschool,the school is often seen as some-thing alien.Villagers refer to \u201cthe govern-ment\u2019s\u201dschool,not \u201cour\u201dschool.In Voices ofthe Poorpeople often complain ofabsent orabusive teachers and demands for illegalfees to get their children into school or toin\ufb02uence examination results.318A study ofschooling in rural Nigeria found that vil-lagers often stopped expecting anythingfrom government schools,shouldering theburden themselves.319Stagnant productivityCreating and maintaining an institutionalenvironment that promotes higher produc-tivity and more learning is not easy.Arecent set ofstudies documented thatspending per pupil in real terms hasincreased by 50 percent or more,often two-112WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Figure 7.1Poor children: less likelyto start

facts is that measured learning achieve-ment per dollar spent has fallen dramati-cally in every country examined.For higher-quality systems,strengthen the relationships of accountabilityDespite enormous differences in attain-ment,equity,and learning across countries,the features ofschool systems are strikinglysimilar.Public production is almost alwaysthe dominant\u2014ifnot exclusive\u2014means ofgovernment support ofeducation.Whetherin Argentina,Egypt,India,Indonesia,Paraguay,or Tanzania,public systems dis-play age-grade organization ofclassrooms,replication ofsocial structures and inequal-ities,and similar ways oftraining,hiring,compensating,and promoting teachers.Despite these surface similarities,there arewidely different outcomes.Both Nigeriaand Singapore retain many ofthe organiza-tional elements ofBritish education.Yet onone international achievement test in the1980s Nigeria was among the worst per-formers while Singapore is frequentlyamong the best.That public provision has often failed tocreate universally available and effectiveschooling does not imply that the solutionis a radically different approach (completedecentralization,total control by parentgroups,generalized choice) or a narrowfocus on proximate determinants (moretextbooks,more teacher training).Univer-sal and quality education can come fromvery centralized systems (France,Japan) orfrom very decentralized systems with con-siderable local accountability and \ufb02exibility(United States).Many countries have littleprivate schooling,and some a great deal(Holland).Classroom practice is what mat-ters.Ifthe underlying causes offailure arenot addressed,all these approaches can fail.Chapters 3 through 6 developed a frame-work for analyzing service provision,lookingat four relationships ofaccountability.Ineducation,these are:\u2022Voice,or how well citizens can hold thestate\u2014politicians and policymakers\u2014accountable for performance in dis-charging its responsibility for education.\u2022Compacts,or how well and how clearlythe responsibilities and objectives ofpublic engagement are communicated tothe public and to private organizationsthat provide services (Ministries ofEdu-cation,school districts).\u2022Management,or the actions that createeffective frontline providers (teachers,administrators) within organizations.\u2022Client power,or how well citizens,asclients,can increase the accountability ofschools and school systems.Effective solutions are likely to be mixturesofvoice,choice,direct participation,and orga-nizational command and control,with func-tional responsibilities distributed amongcentral,regional,local,and school administra-tions.The pieces have to \ufb01t together as a sys-tem.More scope for parental choice withoutgreater information about schooling outputswill not necessarily lead to better results.Infor-mation systems that produce data on inputsBasic education

incentivesoffrontline providers cannot improve quality.Schools and teachers cannot be made moreaccountable for results without also receivingsuf\ufb01cient autonomy and resources and theopportunities to build capabilities.Conversely,schools cannot be given autonomy unless theyare given clear objectives and regular assess-ments ofprogress.What successful education systems share isa working structure ofaccountability:clearobjectives,adequate resources,and capableand motivated providers.This Report focuseson institutional reforms to achieve that systemofaccountability\u2014not on the proximatedeterminants ofsuccess,such as curriculumdesign,pedagogical methods,textbooks,teacher training,school construction,or newinformation technologies.Institutional re-forms will achieve desired outcomes by affect-ing proximate determinants\u2014and proximatedeterminants that produce good education arethe outcome ofwell-structured and well-func-tioning systems.But efforts to improve proxi-mate determinants through internal manage-ment initiatives have usually failed.Why?", u"['SDG_3', 'SDG_4', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_9', 'SDG_11']Nearly all empirical studies ofmeasuredlearning achievement agree that home back-ground accounts for most ofthe explainablevariation in learning outcomes,especially inprimary grades.The same studies disagreewidely about how much can be attributed toa child\u2019s school.The recent Programme forInternational Student Assessment studyfound wide variation in differences in studentperformance within or between schools(table 7.2).Halfor more ofthe variation inperformance across schools was due to varia-tion in students\u2019socioeconomic status,not tofactors under school control.In poorer coun-tries the effect ofschools is larger\u2014and thatofparental background smaller.But,in gen-eral,identifying the school\u2019s value added isnot simple.Even for outputs easier to specify andmeasure,not much is known about howinputs affect them.Economists summarizethis relationship under the metaphor ofa\u201cproduction function.\u201dLittle is known aboutthis function because instruction involveshuman beings\u2014teachers and students\u2014inall their complexity.For instance,there isongoing,vigorous debate about the relevanceofclass size for student test scores.Someassert that class size is irrelevant,or nearly so.Some assert that reductions in class size havesuch a salutary impact on performance thatthey are a cost-effective means ofimprovingperformance.327After more than a century ofwidespread use ofclassroom instruction,intelligent,well-meaning,and methodologi-cally sophisticated researchers are still debat-ing such a seemingly simple issue.That showshow truly complex the research questionsare\u2014the results will vary across time,con-tent,and context.Assessment systemsNational assessment systems are essential formonitoring educational achievement.But per-formance measurement is as complex as themany goals societies have for their schools.Performance measurement is not an attemptto reduce the output ofschooling to the abilityofstudents to answer questions on standard-ized examinations.The dangers oftest-basedschool accountability have been debated for atleast 140 years (box 7.2).You get what you payfor.But there are also dangers in too littleattention to performance.It is important todistinguish among the three types ofassess-ment:sample-based assessments to track per-formance over time,\u201cgatekeeper\u201dexamina-tions that are high stakes for students,andassessments ofschool performance.Tracking progress.One way to strengthenthe compact between policymakers and edu-cation providers is to develop measurementand reporting systems that allow investiga-tion ofvalue for money.Standardized exami-nations are a relatively inexpensive device formonitoring progress and effectiveness.Butfew education systems in the developingworld have disaggregated the cost ofrunninga school,and even fewer know how that costis associated with learning.So there is almostno reporting based on such measurements.The lack ofinformation leads to an inabilityto act accordingly.When the data are revealed,they can besurprising.One study that generated datarelating expenditures and learning at theBasic education services119Test-based school accountability mightseem like the latest thing.It isn\u2019t.British leg-islation for school funding in 1862 includeda system of \u201cpayments for results.\u201dIn addi-tion to a base grant (based on number ofchildren and attendance),schools receiveda grant for each student who passed aseries of tests given by school inspectors inreading,writing,and arithmetic.Proponents of the testing argued thatperformance-based transfers were onlycommon sense since public money wasinvolved.As one parliamentary proponentreasoned:paying for performance willeither be cheap (because few schools meetthe standard) or expensive (because manystudents have high performance)\u2014but itwill not be both expensive and ineffective.Educational historians claim that the pay-ments provided teachers (who at the timehad little training) with clear indications ofwhat was valued and tangible awards forachievement.Opponents raised the same argumentsmade today.Teachers will \u201cteach to the test\u201dand ignore subjects not covered by the test(such as history and geography).Test-basedaccountability will lead to teaching meth-ods that emphasize rote memorization andcramming.One educator argued that \u201cpay-ment for results\u201dwould \u201cbe rememberedwith shame.\u201dThis particular system of \u201cpayment forresults\u201dwas abolished in 1890.But thedebate continues today.Sources:Based on Bowen (1981) and Good andTeller (1969).BOX 7.2Test-based accountability\u2014nothing new underthe sun15_WDR_Ch07.qxd  8/14/03  9:23 AM  Page 119\x0c(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank\n\nschool level in Africa found little connec-tion\u2014Mauritanian schools with similarspending had pass rates ofless than 5 per-cent and more than 95 percent (\ufb01gure 7.4).Needed for active management aredata\u2014on school costs,on the characteris-tics ofstudents,and on school performanceon cognitive achievement tests.Onceimplemented,these sample-based systemscan be gradually scaled up to provide morecensus-like measurements.Gatekeeper examinations.In most coun-tries examinations are seen as a fair way ofallocating limited school places.One studysuggests that the impact on student perfor-mance ofcentralized curriculum-basedexaminations is as large as that associatedwith differences in parental education orwith substantially more formal educationfor teachers (\ufb01gure 7.5).Since centralizedexaminations make relevant informationwidely available,they can be useful for gen-erating accountability.The impact ofpublic examinations onthe incentives ofvarious actors points tosystemic considerations.For instance,teacher training programs often attempt toinstill pedagogical techniques that promotehigher-order thinking skills.But when gate-keeper public examinations assess only rotememorization,teachers frequently revert tosimilar methods.And ifpublic examina-tions have a major impact on students\u2019lifechances,parents will exert pressure on theschool system for better examinationresults.Where public examinations are lim-ited and educationally inadequate,perversepressures can worsen true educational qual-ity in the interests ofbetter examinationscores.School-based accountability for examina-tion results.School accountability is con-troversial\u2014with good reason.There isempirical evidence that accountability mech-anisms based on examination results lead to\u201cteaching to the test\u201dand to attempts tomanipulate results.Evidence from locationsas diverse as rural Kenya (see chapter 11 andbox 7.5 later in this chapter) and urbanChicago shows that accountability raisedexamination scores\u2014but also that teachersmanipulated the students taking the exam,and taught to the test.But teaching to the test is a criticism onlyifthe test is not a reliable assessment oftheskills that are the objective ofpublic sup-port for schooling\u2014or ifthe tests divertteachers from more productive activities,such as teaching higher-order thinking.There is a tradeoffbetween what the testcosts (in design,testing,and scoring) andhow well it captures desired schooling out-put.Tests in some circumstances coulddivert teachers from more productive to lessproductive activities,such as \u201cdrills.\u201dBut inmany cases performance is so weak thateven \u201cless productive\u201dbut learning-ori-ented activities would be an improvement.120WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 20040CentralizedexamsMathScienceTeacher withPhD/MA/bachelor degree5101520Parent completedtertiary/secondaryeducationIncremental test scoreSource:W\xf6\xdfmann

The World Bank\n\nThere are three important technicaldesign issues with school-based account-ability.First,the characteristics ofstudents,their peers,and their families are far andaway the largest determinants ofvariation inperformance.Any attempt to judge schoolson their level ofperformance will thereforebe judging the socioeconomic compositionofthe school\u2014a \u201cgood\u201dschool might sim-ply have wealthier students.This is true onaverage.Some schools serving poorer popu-lations perform well or even very well (\ufb01g-ure 7.6).And some schools with wealthierstudents are mediocre.To focus on school value added ratherthan differences based on school popula-tions,scores can be empirically adjusted forthe composition ofthe student body (box7.3).Or assessments can measure changes instudent performance (which assumes thatsocioeconomic composition is roughly con-stant).Or a threshold can be set that allschools\u2014whatever their student composi-tion\u2014are expected to achieve.A second design issue in school-basedaccountability is statistical sampling.Inmany schools the number ofstudents issmall enough to result in considerable vari-ability.That means that even schools withstrong improvements over time will haveyears when scores are lower than in previ-ous years\u2014simply because ofthe mix andnumber ofstudents.It also means that aprogram ofrewards or punishments forperformance would disproportionatelyreward and punish small schools relative tolarge schools.The third design issue iswhether to reward good performance orintervene in bad performance\u2014or both.School autonomyAccountability and autonomy are twins.Traditional public sector bureaucracies havelittle autonomy because accountability islinked to rules and procedures,which allowsfor little discretion.The heads ofindividualschools are often bound by process require-ments and so have little autonomy toactively manage their schools\u2014to de\ufb01ne amission,choose instructional staff,inno-vate,or encourage performance.Grantinggreater autonomy requires new forms ofaccountability based on outputs and out-comes.The roles ofthe ministry ofeduca-tion can be unbundled so as to separate edu-cation policy from the operation ofschools.A more explicit compact relationship can bemade with organizational providers,per-haps even with multiple providers withinthe same jurisdiction.This structure cangive clearer guidance on desired outputs andoutcomes,freeing school heads and teachersto pursue de\ufb01ned goals.Nicaragua created autonomous publicschools guided by a school directive councilcomprising the school head,elected teach-ers,parents,and students.The schoolretained revenue from students,and thecouncil could make decisions about person-nel,\ufb01nance,and pedagogy.The averageschool autonomy reported by these schoolswas between that reported by traditionalpublic schools (very little) and privateschools (almost complete).The degree ofself-reported school autonomy was posi-tively correlated with student performanceon test scores at the primary level (thoughnot at the secondary)\u2014but autonomy onpaper was not.In a study in Chile very littleofthe variation (less than 1 percent) inthree measures ofself-reported autonomyofteachers was between the four types ofschools\u2014public,private voucher,privatepaid,and Catholic voucher.More ofthevariation was between schools ofthe sameBasic education services121Since 1996 Chile has had an award for \u201ctop-performing\u201dschools in each region.Ninetypercent of the award goes directly to teach-ers (in proportion to their hours of employ-ment),and 10 percent is allocated to theschools.The awards are given every twoyears.Schools are divided into comparisongroups within each region of the countrybased on location (rural,urban),educationlevel (primary only,secondary withprimary),and socioeconomic status of par-ents (according to information collected aspart of the examination and an of\ufb01cial\u201cindex of vulnerability\u201d).In 2000\u201301 thisclassi\ufb01cation produced 104 comparisongroups.In this way the performance of poorrural schools is not compared head-to-headwith that of richer urban schools.Analysissuggests that this procedure diminishes thecorrelation between socioeconomic statusand awards.Next,an index of school performance iscalculated based on standardized tests inSpanish and mathematics in grades 4,8,and 10.The index is weighted for averagetest level (37 percent) and improvement intest scores (28 percent) and includes

classroom tasksconsistently emerges as a determinant ofsuccess (box 7.4).The principles developedin chapter 6 are apt:discretion and deci-sionmaking power need to be delegated tothose with the relevant information andprofessional skills.Centralized control ofteacher assignment and assessment cancause bureaucratic paralysis.But makingschools autonomous in curriculum design,examinations,assessment,and \ufb01nance canlead to excessive variability across schools.Innovating,evaluating,and scaling upThe goal ofschool autonomy and account-ability is to create a system in which organiza-tional providers have strong,sustained incen-tives to improve outputs.The problem is nota lack ofinnovation\u2014there is a continualstream ofnew modes ofteacher training,newteaching methods,new instructional inputs,new use ofthe latest technology.The problemis that there is too little systematic learningfrom innovation and too little replication ofproven innovations.The contrasting use ofrigorous evalua-tions in health and education is striking.Inmost developed countries no drug can beused until it is proven safe and effective,andthe standard ofproofis the randomizeddouble-blind clinical trial.But in schooling,instructional practices for hundreds ofmil-lions ofchildren can be changed because anew technology appears promising.Orbecause a group ofexperts thinks so.Orbecause the practice has been tried in a pilotprogram (and subject to \u201cHawthorne\u201deffects,the nonreplicable impacts thatoccur simply as a result ofthe increasedattention from any innovation).Or becauseit has been shown to be statistically corre-lated with success,subject to all the dangersofimproperly inferring causation.There isstrikingly little use ofrandomized con-trolled experiments as a routine manage-ment practice\u2014despite its eminent feasibil-ity for many classroom practices (box 7.5).A recent example ofevaluating a school-ing innovation illustrates the power of\ufb02exi-bility in design\u2014and the power ofevalua-tion.A remedial education program,established as a collaboration between thegovernment and a nongovernmental orga-nization (NGO) in two cities in India(Mumbai and Vadodara),hired localwomen to teach catch-up classes for stu-dents who were falling behind.The programwas inexpensive\u2014$5 a child a year.A rigor-ous evaluation based on the randomizeddesign ofthe program found it very effectiveat boosting learning,especially amongpoorer children.The evaluation showedthat,at the margin,extending the programwould be about \ufb01ve times more cost-effec-tive than hiring new teachers.329 The pro-gram is implemented now in 20 Indiancities,reaching tens ofthousand ofchildren.But \u201cthere is a particular irony to educa-tion reform

depressingly122WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004The Third International Mathematics andScience Study (TIMSS) created a data set onstudent performance and characteristicsand on institutional characteristics of theschooling system such as use of centralizedexaminations and central,local,and schooldecisionmaking responsibilities.Analysis ofthe performance of more than 266,000 stu-dents from some 6,000 schools in 39(mostly OECD) countries yielded the follow-ing conclusions:\u2022Money cannot buy quality in presentschooling systems.\u2022Incentives are the key to success.\u2022Schools should be allowed to decideautonomously on operational tasks.\u2022Schools must be made accountable.\u2022Teachers\u2019incentives have to focus onimproving student performance.\u2022Competition

32(mostly OECD) countries along with infor-mation from students and principals aboutthemselves and schools.The conclusions forwhat schools can do to make a differencewere:\u2022Students\u2019reported use of schoolresources was more closely associatedwith performance than principals\u2019reportsof resource de\ufb01ciencies.\u2022The ratio of students to teachers matterswhere it is high,while in the typical rangethere is a much weaker association withperformance.\u2022Three factors of school policy are associ-ated with better student performance:school autonomy,teacher morale andcommitment,and other teacher factorssuch as expectations.\u2022Three classroom practices reported bystudents show a positive association withperformance:the extent to which teach-ers emphasize performance,teacher-stu-dent relations,and the disciplinaryclimate of the classroom.\u2022Successful students are more likely to dohomework.Sources:W\xf6\xdfmann (2003) and OECD (2001).BOX 7.4Two

\u201cproxi-mate determinants\u201dto a more systemicapproach that focuses on internally drivenidenti\ufb01cation and scaling up ofgood prac-tices.A recent review ofUSAID projectsbased on systemic reform found,not surpris-ingly,that implementation was dif\ufb01cultbecause it went to the heart ofthe relation-ships ofaccountability among actors in edu-cation\u2014and that was intensely political.Even so,recent work at USAID exploressolutions to the challenges oflinking author-ity,accountability,and transparency tostrengthen basic education through institu-tional reform.There are several ways ofexpanding and scaling up good practice.331The most obvious way is to use greaterschool autonomy\u2014leaving scope for schoolmanagement to de\ufb01ne a school mission,mandate,and tactics\u2014and greater account-ability to enable the monitoring ofperfor-mance.The autonomy and accountabilitycreate incentives to adopt proven successfulpractices,to evaluate the effectiveness ofhomegrown initiatives,and to create a senseofpride and commitment in the school.Accountability is,ofcourse,dif\ufb01cult tode\ufb01ne.Is it accountability within thebureaucracy (so that policymakers chooseand replace principals based on perfor-mance)?", u"['SDG_4', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_16']Some believe that teachershave too little power,arguing that educa-tional reforms ignore teachers.Followedthrough,this view can lead to reforms thatignore classroom and school-level realities,further demoralizing teachers and under-mining reforms.Others believe that teach-ers,especially teachers\u2019unions,have toomuch power and focus exclusively onwages and working conditions (box 7.8).Both sides can marshal empirical evidence.Much ofthe debate stems from the jointfunction ofteachers\u2019unions as profes-sional organizations,which exist to pro-mote ef\ufb01cacy,advance professional knowl-edge,and advocate views in public policy;and as agents ofcollective bargaining,which emphasize resources and workingconditions.Basic education services129Reforms to promote greater parentalinvolvement,more school autonomy,moreemphasis on results,and changes in thetraining,selection,assignment,andcompensation of teachers are politicallyexplosive\u2014particularly with teachers\u2019unions.A study of \ufb01ve attempts at educa-tion reforms that included many of theseelements in Latin America in the 1990sfound that teachers\u2019unions opposed nearlyall of them\u2014emphatically and stridently.\u201cTeacher\u2019s unions in Mexico,MinasGerais,Brazil,Bolivia,Nicaragua,and Ecuadorfollowed similar strategies in opposing edu-cation reform.All used strikes to assert theirpower ...against unwanted changes.Thepower to disrupt public life,to close downschools and ministries,to stop traf\ufb01c in capi-tal cities,to appeal to public opinion\u2014werefamiliar actions to them.\u201dIn April 1999 theannouncement by the Bolivian Ministry ofEducation of its intention to transfer teachercolleges to public universities set teachersand students at those colleges \u201crioting in thestreets,breaking windows,attacking police,throwing rocks,and setting cars on \ufb01re\u201d(images the government used to mobilizepublic opinion against the unions).Teachers\u2019unions wanted governments toaddress the issues of teachers\u2019wages andworking conditions and were concerned thatdecentralization and school autonomy wouldintrude on more familiar relationships andnegotiations between a centralized schooladministration and a centralized union.Even when governments pushedreforms through,con\ufb02icts with the unionsmade implementation problematic,sincesuccessful reform requires teacher partici-pation.Source:Grindle (forthcoming).BOX 7.8Education reform and teachers\u2019unions in LatinAmerica15_WDR_Ch07.qxd  8/14/03  9:28 AM  Page 129\x0c(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction

schools,bearing the cost them-selves and paying teachers when they could.The government seized on this model ofcommunity-based schooling as the basis fora formal program that would be \ufb01nanciallyand administratively supported by the min-istry:Educaci\xf3n con Participaci\xf3n de laComunidad,or Educo,with the goal ofencouraging the establishment ofpreschoolsand primary schools,or classrooms in exist-ing schools.Begun in 1991,Educo targeted 78 ofthecountry\u2019s poorest rural municipalities (of221 urban and rural municipalities).By 1993the program was expanding to all ruralareas,including many areas formerly underopposition control.But not all ofthe \u201cpopu-lar schools\u201destablished during the war wereincorporated into Educo.Some observersclaimed there was selective inclusion basedon political favoritism;others saw not incor-porating popularschools into a governmentprogram as a way ofsustaining spontaneouscommunity-based education.350Each Educoschool (or section within atraditional school) is operated by a Com-munity Education Association (ACE)\u2014anelected committee made up primarily ofstudents\u2019parents\u2014that enters into a one-year renewable agreement with the min-istry.The agreement outlines rights,responsibilities,and \ufb01nancial transfers.TheMinistry ofEducation oversees basic policyand technical design.Using the moneydirectly transferred to them,ACEs select,hire,monitor,and retain or dismiss teach-ers.Teachers at Educoschools are hired onone-year renewable contracts.Parents aretaught about school management and howto assist their children at home.351Three-quarters of new enrollmentsEducosucceeded in many respects.From apilot phase ofsix ACEs in three depart-ments,it scaled up nationally to all ofthecountry\u2019s departments by 1993.Rural pri-mary enrollments increased from 476,000in 1992 to 555,000 in 1995\u2014with over 75El Salvador was wracked by civil warthroughout the 1980s.Some 80,000people died\u2014in a total populationofroughly 5 million\u2014and many more werewounded and disabled.Income per capitafell almost 40 percent between 1978 and1983.345In 1989 the conservative Republi-can Alliance Party won a majority in thenational assembly,with Alfredo Cristiani aspresident.Despite contentious negotia-tions,a peace accord was signed in January1992.346The war had severely damaged the edu-cation system.Communication betweenthe central ministry and schools brokedown,supervision collapsed,and manyteachers,viewed by some as government\u201cagents\u201dand by others as agents ofsocialopposition,abandoned their posts.By 1988more than a third ofthe country\u2019s primaryschools had closed.347And by the end ofthewar some 1 million children were not inschool.348Establishing Educo\u2014Education with the Participation of CommunitiesThe Ministry ofEducation quickly identi-\ufb01ed expanding access to basic educationand raising its quality as central goals\u2014both to rebuild national unity and to pro-mote long-term economic development.Minister ofEducation Cecilia Gallardo deCano,a reform proponent from the \u201cmod-ernizing\u201dwing ofthe Republican AllianceParty,was intent on lessening the distrustbetween former combatants.But skepticism was high.The MinistryofEducation was not trusted in many partsofthe country and by organized groupssuch as the National Association ofTeach-ers.Expansion ofthe traditional educationsystem was viewed suspiciously as a covertmeans ofreasserting national control andbuilding political support in opposition-dominated areas.349During the war many communities hadrecruited local teachers and establishedpercent ofthe new students enrolled inEducoschools (\ufb01gure 1).By 2001 therewere almost 260,000 students enrolled inEducoprimary schools,41 percent ofallstudents enrolled in rural schools\u2014andmore than 100,000 children enrolled inEducopreschools,57 percent ofall childrenin preschool.Even as enrollments increased rapidly,there is little evidence that learning qualitysuffered.A survey of30 Educoprimaryschools and 101 traditional schools in 1996found no signi\ufb01cant differences in averagemath and language test scores among thirdgraders in the two types ofschools.352A fol-low-up study in 1998 found that grade pro-motion and repetition were similar acrossthe two types ofschools as well.353As theinnovation matured,the institutionalarrangements that it introduced took holdand ensured rapid expansion ofschoolplaces and enrollments ofpoor children,seemingly without a substantial cost inquality.354Parent visits to classrooms made muchofthe differenceThat Educoschools served the poorest ofElSalvador\u2019s students,in the poorest areas,makes these results all the more astonish-ing.How did they do it?", u"['SDG_1', 'SDG_3', 'SDG_4', 'SDG_6', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_11']At least part ofthe story isIs the Educo model applicable elsewhere?Educo\u2019s achievements might appear idio-syncratic.The end ofa bloody civil war thathad thrown the traditional education sys-tem into chaos opened up a unique oppor-tunity to change the way schools were man-aged.Based in part on coping strategiesduring the civil war,El Salvador had a his-tory ofcommunity involvement in schoolmanagement.Indeed,the community asso-ciations appear to have worked better inplaces that had prior experience in commu-nity organization.358In addition,in theaftermath ofthe war there was an unusuallylarge pool ofeducated people without jobs(coinciding with the rapid expansion ofuniversity places fueled by opening highereducation to the private sector).These factors suggest that the Educomodel might not be directly replicable in adifferent setting.But some lessons are gen-eral.First,with political will it is possible tochange the relationships between the actorsin basic education.Second,schools can betransformed to work in ways that promoteenrollment,participation,and learning\u2014even for children from the poorest house-holds.Third,getting parents to participateeffectively in managing schools can helpovercome some ofthe potential pitfalls inthe provision ofeducation services\u2014espe-cially monitoring schooling in remoteareas.Fourth,it is possible to scale up smallinnovations to have a signi\ufb01cant impact

areoften excluded from support networks thatenhance the social and economic bene\ufb01ts ofgood health.Unlike education,health andnutrition outcomes ofpoor people are pro-duced by households\u2014with contributionsfrom many services.And health and nutri-tion services contribute to other aspects ofhuman welfare,such as protecting peoplefrom catastrophic health spending.Theyshould thus be judged by the way they con-tribute to the poor\u2019s health outcomes,to pro-tecting citizens from impoverishing healthexpenditures,and to helping the poor breakout oftheir social exclusion.Throughout history,poor people haveoften paid health providers directly.But thisshort route from client to provider isblunted by asymmetries ofinformation andcon\ufb02icts ofinterest.Another problem:poorpeople lack the money for market transac-tions.A variety ofmarket failures\u2014disease-related externalities and fragmented insur-ance markets\u2014and concerns for equityjustify public intervention in \ufb01nancinghealth and nutrition services.But govern-ments \ufb01nd it dif\ufb01cult to monitor the per-formance ofhealth workers,especiallythose delivering highly discretionary ser-vices,such as clinical care.And since insur-ance-market failures affect everybody,thenon-poor often capture public \ufb01nancing ofhealth care.Health services are failing poor peoplenot because oflack ofknowledge for pre-venting and treating illnesses but becausehealth systems are trapped in a web offailedrelationships ofaccountability.To break outofthis trap,service delivery arrangementscan be tailored for three classes ofservices:\u2022Getting highly transaction-intensive anddiscretionary individual-oriented clini-calservices to poor people is most chal-lenging.To in\ufb02uence quality,poor clientsshould have greater power\u2014throughthird-party payments,information,andgreater oversight ofhealth workers andfacilities.Organized citizens can exertthis power by contributing \ufb01nancialresources and co-producing and moni-toring the services.But insurance marketfailures,asymmetries ofknowledge,andcon\ufb02icts ofinterest mean that govern-ments need to invest in purchasing keyservices to protect poor households andfoster a pro-poor professional ethos.\u2022Population-oriented outreachservices\u2014standardized services that can include vec-tor control,immunization,or vitamin Asupplementation\u2014are easier for policy-makers to monitor.Even governmentswith limited capacity can provide theseservices\u2014or write contracts with publicor private entities to provide them.Build-ing coalitions to strengthen poor people\u2019scollective voice is essential to ensure ade-quate public resources for those services.\u2022For community andfamily-orientedservicesthat support self-care\u2014such asinformation and social support for pro-moting breastfeeding or safe sex\u2014com-munity and civil society organizationsand commercial networks are often wellplaced to provide services close to poorhouseholds.Governments can establishpartnerships and provide informationand targeted subsidies.Policymakers need to be accountable forhealth outcomes\u2014which means greater invest-ment in monitoring and evaluation mecha-nisms that capture disparities in health.359Health and nutrition services8chapter17_WDR_Ch08.qxd  8/14/03

likely tocontinue in many countries.But hopes foran ever-improving trend are fading asprogress slowed down in the 1990s.At thecurrent pace most regions ofthe developingworld will not reach the Millennium Devel-opment Goals for health by 2015 (\ufb01gure8.1).Infant mortality rates are increasing inCentral Asia.Under-\ufb01ve mortality is on therise in 22 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.Stunting is rising in many African countriesand remains high in South Asia.In 1995,500,000 women died worldwide as a resultofcomplications associated with pregnancy,mostly in developing countries.The AIDSepidemic is expanding in Africa,India,China,and Russia,along with a resurgenceoftuberculosis.360Adult mortality rates haveworsened in the Russian Federation andsome ofits neighbors.The outcomes are consistently worseamong the disadvantaged.In low-and mid-dle-income countries,under-\ufb01ve mortalityrates are 2.3 times higher among the poorest\ufb01fth ofthe population than among the rich-est \ufb01fth.Stunting rates are 3.4 times higher(\ufb01gure 8.2).361The rich fare well in absoluteterms.In Pelotas,Brazil,infant mortality forthe richest 7 percent ofthe population in1993 was comparable to the average for theNetherlands in 1998.362Communicable diseases,malnutrition,and reproductive ailments account for mostofthe mortality gap between high- andlow-income countries and between the richand poor.363The poor also often suffer fromhigher rates ofnoncommunicable diseasessuch as depression and cardiovascular dis-eases in North America or alcohol-relatedailments in the Russian Federation.Malnu-trition is a double burden:poorest groupshave both high rates ofmalnutrition anddiabetes and obesity.364Improving health outcomes for the pooris a complex task.In addition to income,other household factors in\ufb02uence health out-comes:age,social status,religion,residence(chapter 1),ethnic background (box 8.1),andgender\u2014particularly in South Asia.Girls inIndia are 30 to 50 percent more likely to diebetween the age ofone and \ufb01ve than boys.365Maternal mortality depends mainly on healthservices while nutrition and under-\ufb01ve mor-tality depend on many other services,such aseducation,water,food security,communica-tion,electri\ufb01cation,and transportation.TheAIDS epidemic has particularly challengedpolicymakers and providers to look at linkswith other sectors and focus more on behav-ior and societal values.Health services can work for poor peopleExperience from Brazil,Chile,Costa Ricaand Cuba (spotlight),Iran (box 8.2),Nepal,Matlab (Bangladesh),Tanzania,and severalWest African countries (spotlight) showsthat health services,ifdelivered well,canimprove outcomes for even the poorestgroups.A health program in the Gadchirolidistrict in India reduced neonatal mortalityrates by 62 percent.Midwifery services andcommunity hospitals are linked to dramaticreductions in neonatal and maternal mor-tality in Sri Lanka and Malaysia.In Ugandaand Thailand government efforts changedsexual behavior,reducing the prevalence ofHIV.In low- and middle-income countriesservices promoting oral rehydration therapyled to a decrease in diarrhea-related childmortality.366Health services also help protect the incomeofthe poor.Locally managed \ufb01nancingschemes in Niger,contracted-out services inCambodia,and insurance schemes targetingpoor people in Thailand and Indonesia helpedreduce out-of-pocket spending and extendedthe reach ofthe safety net among the poor.367134WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Figure 8.1Reaching

issues,and lack ofdecisionmaking power are oftenthe causes (\ufb01gure 8.5).373Studies ofthe rich-poor gap in health outcomes show that thepoor and the non-poor may respond to thesame level ofinputs differently.374In Senegalthe poor are 39 percent less ef\ufb01cient than therich at translating drinking water,sanitation,and health services into better health.In Mali,the poor are only 16 percent

use the commercial sec-tor to purchase key commodities forimproving health.In Colombia and Mexicocommunity cooperatives distribute insecti-cide-treated bed nets.In more than 40 coun-tries social marketing programs have reliedon market incentives.They have increasedthe use ofbed nets,condoms,contracep-tives,soap,and locally produced disinfectantfor water treatment (which has reduced therisk ofdiarrhea by 44 to 85 percent).387Modest copayments can also provide anentry ticket to clinical services for poor peo-ple by reducing capture ofsupposedly freeservices by richer groups (box 4.4).Con-trolled studies in several countries388\ufb01ndimprovements in the use ofservices amongpoor people after copayments increased thetransparency and accountability ofpro-viders to poor clients (\ufb01gure 8.9).But to bepro-poor copayments need to be retainedlocally and tied to performance,and theyneed to contribute to the income ofpro-viders rather than compensate for inade-quate public funds (chapter 4).Health and nutrition services143Budgeting approaches often don\u2019t link the moneyspent with the expected results.The impact ofpublic funds invested in health services and theircontribution to the Millennium DevelopmentGoals are thus dif\ufb01cult to assess.Budgeting thecontribution of health and nutrition services togoals should address three questions:1.What are the major bottlenecks hamperingthe delivery of health services,and what is thepotential for improvement?The analysis of the determinants of the baselinecoverage of interventions in terms of availabilityof critical resources (human and material),physi-cal accessibility,demand (utilization of the ser-vices),and continuity and quality of health ser-vices helps identify the main constraints to theincrease in coverage.In Madagascar the bottlenecks of clinical careare mainly low quality,utilization,and humanresource availability.Increasing the demand forclinical services (scenario 2) especially the use ofhealth facilities or skilled health workers for thetreatment of severe respiratory infections (sce-nario 1) could raise the effective coverage of thisintervention to almost 60 percent.The potentialfor improving the availability of health staff inpoor rural areas (scenario 3) is limited,and thisdetermines a real-life \u201ccoverage frontier\u201d(at 80percent).In Ethiopia the coverage with at leastone dose of DPT (diphtheria-pertussis-tetanusvaccine) in relation to the geographical access isthe main bottleneck,while the dropout betweenthe \ufb01rst and third dose of DPT constitutesanother obstacle to adequate coverage withoutreach services.Increasing the use of  immu-nization services through information and com-munication (scenario 2) as well as defaultertracking (scenario 1) can increase the adequatecoverage to over 80 percent.In Madhya Pradeshin India,late initiation and non-exclusiveness ofbreastfeeding (BF) are the main bottlenecksidenti\ufb01ed in self-care.Increasing the use (earlyinitiation of BF,scenario 2) and quality (exclusive-ness of BF,scenario 1) of healthy home practicesthrough information and the creation of a sup-portive environment can increase effective cov-erage to nearly 80 percent.2.How much money is needed for the expectedresults?Once coverage bottlenecks and the potential forimprovement (coverage frontiers) have beenidenti\ufb01ed for each mode of health servicesdelivery,the cost of the strategies can be calcu-lated using country-speci\ufb01c data.This allows thepreparation of investment and recurrent bud-gets that speci\ufb01cally support strategies mostlikely to improve ef\ufb01ciency of demand (scenario1),support increased demand (scenario 2),orincrease access to health services and availabil-ity of health staff (scenario 3).This enables Min-istries of Health and Finance to determine thespending needed to support the goals and toencourage policymakers to ensure funding ofpriority activities that address the major cover-age bottlenecks.3.How much can be achieved in healthoutcomes by removing the bottlenecks?The increase in coverage in speci\ufb01cinterventions achievable through well-targetedstrategies and budgets such as those de\ufb01nedabove can be converted into measures ofimproved health outcomes using various epi-demiological models.Preliminary analysis canshow the reduction in under-\ufb01ve mortality ratethat can be expected from removing the bottle-necks of clinical care,outreach services,and self-care in Madagascar,Ethiopia,and MadhyaPradesh,India.Source:UNICEF and World Bank (2003).BOX 8.4Buying results to reach the Millennium Development Goals (continued)17_WDR_Ch08.qxd  8/14/03  9:49 AM  Page 143\x0c(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank\n\nYet for many services the purchasingpower ofpoor people remains insuf\ufb01cientto overcome price barriers (table 8.2).Mar-keting programs for condoms are unlikelyto be pro-poor in the early stages,and afocus on cost recovery excludes thepoorest.389Governments can then providesubsidies,as is often done for food toaddress malnutrition.The subsidies mayneed to be very high to substantiallyincrease use among poor people,as demon-strated in the programs to distribute freecondoms to sex workers390and to offer bednets as part ofantenatal care.391Market seg-mentation,tier pricing,and product differ-entiation can be helpful.In Malawi,highlysubsidized bed nets for pregnant womendiffer in color and shape from regular mar-ket-priced nets.392Cross-subsidizing pre-ventive and maternal and child health ser-vices using the margins on fees for adultclinical care made the \ufb01rst more affordablein Bolivia.393Direct transfers to client households\u2014demand-side subsidies\u2014can also boostclient power.Vouchers have a good record inpromoting use ofsome well-de\ufb01ned ser-vices.Food stamps can increase food con-sumption.394In Honduras and Nicaraguafamilies receive \ufb01nancial stipends under thecondition that they use key preventive healthservices.395Financial support throughvouchers for consultations reduced sexuallytransmitted diseases for sex workers (box8.5).And poverty funds ensured third-partypayments for the poor in China.396How thesubsidies are managed matters,however.InTanzania,the poor pregnant women targetedby the bed net program almost never usedthe vouchers,probably because the subsidieswere too low.397A problem with subsidies is how wellthey reach the poor.Thailand\u2019s low-incomeinsurance scheme has used demand-sidesubsidies\u2014health cards\u2014for clinical ser-vices,but about a third ofthe bene\ufb01ciarieswere not poor and halfthe poor did notbene\ufb01t.398 Demand-side subsidies also havelimits ifprovided in isolation.Even well-targeted food-related transfer programs sel-dom have measurable impacts on malnutri-tion unless accompanied by programs topromote breastfeeding,complementaryfeeding,hygiene,and care ofchildhood ill-nesses.In Mexico the success ofthe Educa-tion,Health,and Nutrition Program (Pro-gresa\u2014see spotlight) was made possible bya parallel program ofitinerant healthteams.399Coproducing health servicesSelf-care is a particularly important type ofservice co-production,relied on by poorand rich alike,and more common in indus-trial countries than the use ofprofessionalservices.Support to families and communi-ties can help poor communities reduce mal-nutrition,as in East Asia where community-based programs were linked to servicedelivery structures,often village outlets forprimary health care.Government employ-ees were trained as facilitators ofnutrition-relevant actions coordinated and managedby volunteers selected by local communities.In Honduras the strongly community-owned AIN-C program reduced severemalnutrition by 31 percent.Civil societyorganizations can serve as intermediariesbetween clients and providers.Women\u2019ssupport groups have helped spread the prac-tice ofexclusive breastfeeding in Africa andLatin America.Other successes includegreater use oforal rehydration solutions,better environmental health,and betterAIDS interventions.400Communities are often involved in build-ing health facilities.But they have also takenover provision and management ofprofes-sional health services,as in the more than500 community-led health clinics in Peru,which cover more than 2 million people.401Cooperative pharmacies have sprung up inHaiti,Nigeria,and Singapore.The availabil-ity

client-controlled revolving funds inMongolia,Vietnam,and West Africa andthrough Ethiopia\u2019s special pharmacies.Par-ticularly resilient to crisis,these efforts canbe a source ofstability and sustainability.Inthe Democratic Republic ofCongo zones desant\xe9 continued to provide immunizationthrough community-managed services aftermore than two decades,without state ordonor support.402Client \ufb01nancial and managerial controlover health staff\u2014the power to hire andfire\u2014can help ensure that services areactually delivered.In Mali user associationshire and pay professional health staffserv-ing more than 6 million people (spotlighton the Bamako Initiative).There,as inPeru,provider attendance is high,withstrong local ownership ofcommunity cen-ters.But the approach can have problems.The relationship between communities andhealth personnel can become antagonistic,requiring state intervention to arbitratedisputes.And the right oflocal healthboards to hire and \ufb01re staffmay mean littlein countries facing severe human resourceshortages.In Zambia during the healthreform most districts hired the staffalreadyworking in the health facilities.In Mali theshortage ofnurses made recruitment dif\ufb01-cult,loosening the control ofclients overfrontline providers.403Solidarity mechanisms to protectsocially and economically disadvantagedgroups by pooling \ufb01nancial resources canstrengthen communities in their negotia-tions with health care providers.Micro-insurance schemes for health have beenlinked to such traditional modes ofself-organization as rotating savings\u2014as withabotasin Guinea-Bissau and traditionalcommunity schemes in the Philippines.404In Germany and the Republic ofKorea,small,not-for-pro\ufb01t insurance societiesbecame independent purchasers ofhealthservices,contracting with public and pri-vate providers.405The proximity oftheseschemes to their insured members allowseffective monitoring.But the risk pool\u2019ssmall size makes them very vulnerable.Re-insurance can help,406but the added com-plexity can lead to the same managerial andgovernance problems in large-scale publicprovision.The transparency ofdirect com-munity control is lost.Scaling up wouldthen be the kiss ofdeath.Information and monitoringOne ofthe strongest levers for strengthen-ing client power is information,a criticalinstrument for changing selfcare behaviors.Under government leadership in Thailand,messages on AIDS were broadcast everyhour during the peak ofthe epidemic.Butbehavior change is possible only whengrounded in an understanding ofculturalnorms and the links between behavior anddisease\u2014and when local actors areinvolved.Community-based nutrition pro-grams have often improved nutritional sta-tus through information exchanges,as inTamil Nadu,India.In addition to givingwomen greater control over resources,themicrocredit programs ofthe BangladeshRural Action Committee also increasedknowledge.407Clients can exert more leverage onproviders by participating in decisionmak-ing and by monitoring some aspects ofser-vice delivery.Community monitoring ofhealth service performance in Bolivia andVietnam raises community awareness ofkey demand-side barriers and helps ensurethat services meet community needs.Civilsociety representatives are also part ofhealth boards in New Zealand.Theseapproaches increase the transparency ofmanagement.But these health boards alsoremain vulnerable to capture by local elitesunless institutional mechanisms ensure therepresentation ofdisadvantaged clients(chapter 5).408Health and nutrition services145A voucher program has been operating inManagua,Nicaragua,since 1995,with theobjective of increasing the use of reproduc-tive health services by female sex workers.The vouchers entitle the sex workers to freeservices at selected for-pro\ufb01t,NGO,andpublic clinics.The clinic turns the voucher into the voucher agency,which reimbursesthe provider at an agreed-upon fee pervoucher.The incidence of sexually transmit-ted diseases among sex workers who usedthe vouchers dropped by 65 percent in the\ufb01rst three years of the program.Vouchersare now available to the clients of sex work-ers and their partners.Source:Gorter and others (1999).BOX 8.5Vouchers for sex workers in Nicaragua17_WDR_Ch08.qxd  8/14/03  9:50 AM  Page 145\x0c(c) The

professional associations\u2014canenforce provider accountability.But there islittle proofthat such mechanisms work infavor ofthe poor.A study in the United Statesin 2000 found that 97 percent ofpeople withnegligent injury did not sue.Better-offclientswent to court,while poor clients did not.InIndia women from lower castes were lesslikely to use consumers\u2019courts.Seventy-sixpercent ofIndian doctors believed the Con-sumer Protection Act to be only moderatelyeffective because ofweak enforcement andresistance from professionals.Sanctions areoften a weak threat,because health providerstend to protect one another,and accountabil-ity channels do not favor poor clients.Ram-pant corruption in the legal system ofmanycountries also works against poor people.409Strengthening poor

Cear\xe1,Brazil Since ancient times,city councils have beeninvolved in curtailing the spread ofplague,cholera,and leprosy.But the state as the mainactor in health emerged only in the 20th cen-tury,starting in centrally planned systems\u2014the Soviet Union and others\u2014and thenspreading to Western Europe after World WarII,with the government as unchallengedleader ofthe formal health system.Manydeveloping countries have followed,withhealth services being part ofthe social con-tract between the (often) newly independentstates and their citizens.The model was notalways successful\u2014witness the remaininghealth gaps between poor and rich in middle-and low-income countries.But some coun-tries\u2014Brazil,Malaysia,Sri Lanka,and CostaRica (chapter 1)\u2014have done better than oth-ers in making the long route ofaccountabilitywork for poor people by:\u2022Channeling collective resources to poorpeople through multiple allocationmechanisms that combine targeting

International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank\n\nPro-poor coalitions With widespread capture ofhealth servicesby the non-poor,building pro-poor coali-tions to in\ufb02uence health spending is critical.The democratic process conveys what poorcitizens value in health and health care.Theextent ofhealth bene\ufb01ts and the \ufb01nancing ofhealth services are an electoral issue inindustrial countries\u2014and,increasingly,everywhere.In Thailand access to health ser-vices was a key plank in the political platformofthe Thai Rak Thai party,and its proposalfor universal health insurance,with a single30-baht copayment,was eventually imple-mented.413Eliminating hunger was a majortheme in the recent elections in Brazil.Beyond the ballot box,poor citizens cancommunicate their preferences throughnational consultations,such as those forpoverty reduction strategy papers (chapter11).A review ofthe consultation process for25 poverty reduction strategy papers showsthat the poor care about health services,espe-cially access,price,and social distance.In thestate ofOregon in the United States,tradeoffsin bene\ufb01t coverage are discussed in consulta-tions with the public.In the Netherlands theDunning Report,proposing criteria forrationing health services,relied heavily oncitizen consultations.Citizen involvement inbudgeting is now an avenue for more voice inhealth service delivery,as in Porto Alegre,Brazil (chapter 5).414Advocacy by civil society organizationscan put the interests ofgroups forgotten ordiscriminated against on the agenda,as in thecampaign and court action to ban the use ofquinacrine for chemical sterilization in India.Such organizations can build coalitions forthe interests ofthe disadvantaged.Pressurethrough self-help groups and NGOs has trig-gered a productive dialogue on the publicresponse to AIDS in the Philippines andSouth Africa.Yet despite years ofendorsement ofpar-ticipation,most health systems still resistgreater involvement by civil society in in\ufb02u-encing health care allocations.Reforms inthe health sector often engender oppositionby powerful unions and professional associa-tions,which have a much stronger powerbase than poor citizens and can \ufb01ght tomaintain the status quo,as in New Zealand.An altruistic vision can nonetheless motivatecoalitions between providers and citizens forbetter services.Associations ofrural doctorsin Thailand and midwives in Guatemalahave promoted alternative modes ofhealthservice delivery that better reach the poor.Information and monitoring toincrease accountability for outcomesCreating policymaker accountability to citi-zens for delivering health services is a dif\ufb01culttask.A patient dying while waiting in line at apublic hospital makes front-page news.Butthe thousands ofchildren who die oftreat-able or vaccine-preventable diseases do notget equal time.Politicians \ufb01nd it easier toclaim success for building a hospital and pro-viding employment to nurses and doctorsthan for reducing malnutrition among anomadic group.Yet with a web ofmarket andgovernment failures affecting those services,policymakers are uniquely placed to create avision conducive to better outcomes.Theyneed to be accountable for equitably distrib-uted health outcomes,protecting citizensagainst impoverishing health expendituresand helping the poor escape their socialexclusion,and not for the provision ofgrow-ing quantities ofservices.Better informed and educated citizens canmake politicians more accountable.Civilsociety organizations can bridge the asym-metry ofinformation between poor citizensand policymakers.They can bring commu-nity participation into research,to ensurethat the perspectives ofpoor people in\ufb02uencepolicy.Monitoring the performance ofgov-ernment policies,with report cards as in Ban-galore and Ukraine (chapter 5),can workwell,particularly when income-disaggregateddata are available.Civil society can also serve as a watchdog.A Belgian health publication set in motion sixroyal decrees ofprotective legislation bydrawing attention to health hazards.InBolivia a census-based,impact-orientedapproach combines pragmatism with quanti-tative and qualitative approaches.415But gen-erating information to support pro-poorcoalitions is a challenge.Epidemiological sur-veys may neglect the needs ofperipheralsocial groups,such as minority groups orthose affected by less common diseases.148WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 200417_WDR_Ch08.qxd  8/14/03  9:51 AM  Page 148\x0c(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development

policymakers truly care abouthealth services for poor people,it is not easyto translate policy into reality.Making thecompact between policymakers and providerswork for the poor implies that governments:\u2022Benchmark performance for servicesthey can monitor easily;\u2022Foster autonomous providers for clinicalservices;\u2022Establish a strong monitoring function.Buying resultsWidespread de\ufb01ciencies in the technicalquality and ethics offrontline providers serv-ing the poor\u2014whether public or private\u2014reveal an incentive problem.416The solutionlies in some form ofcompact between thepolicymaker and provider to align theprovider\u2019s incentives\u2014already acknowledgedby La Bruy\xe8re in the 17th century\u2014with thepolicymaker\u2019s wishes.How countries can cre-ate incentives to make autonomous or dis-persed health service providers accountablefor outputs and outcomes depends on thenature ofservices and the capacity to createaccountability for public objectives throughpurchasing and regulation.417Outcome-based contracts are dif\ufb01cult toimplement because health outcomes areoften slow to change,dif\ufb01cult and expensiveto measure,and affected by multiple factorsother than health services.Such contracts areespecially dif\ufb01cult to write when outcomesare linked to a variety ofservices,both profes-sional and nonprofessional,as in efforts toreduce under-\ufb01ve mortality or HIV preva-lence.But the experience ofMadagascar andSenegal with nutrition programs for the poorshows that it is possible,at least for malnutri-tion (box 8.7).Less dif\ufb01cult to implement are output-based contracts that specify criteria fordisbursing public subsidies\u2014on the basis ofincreasing immunization rates,for example.Output-based contracting is particularly suc-cessful for easily monitorable,single-product,population-oriented services that can bestandardized.Explicit contracts have proveneffective in serving poor,hard-to-reachgroups.418Output-based fees for services canbe paid to providers when quantity and qual-ity can be de\ufb01ned,thus contributing toimprovements in productivity.In BangladeshNGO \ufb01eld health workers were paid on thebasis oftheir clients\u2019knowledge oforal rehy-dration therapy.Implicit contracts with focus on speci\ufb01coutputs can also work,as demonstrated bythe universal childhood immunization cam-paigns ofthe 1980s,and the Vitamin A sup-plementation and itinerant health teams inEgypt,Indonesia,and Mexico.419Malawi andUzbekistan have achieved immunizationcoverage ofmore than 90 percent among thepoor with very low per capita spending.ButBolivia,Guatemala,and Turkey,with higherlevels ofspending,are much less successfulin providing equitable coverage (\ufb01gure 8.10).Performance-based contracts,whetherdirectly with health providers or with pur-chasers or insurers,need to align money withintent,taking into account the variations ineffort required to produce a given output inpoor and disadvantaged regions and inbetter-offcommunities.420Costs ofservicescan be much higher in remote rural areas,and broad variations have been found in thecost ofimmunization between regions in thesame country.421Health and nutrition services149Community nutrition projects in Madagas-car and Senegal contracted out nutritionalservices.Transaction costs for introducingand maintaining the contracts were 13 per-cent of total project costs in Madagascarand 17 percent in Senegal.Both projectswere well targeted to the poor communities.Activities included growth monitoring,health and nutrition education services formothers,food supplementation for mal-nourished children,and referrals to healthcenters and home visits when necessary.In Madagascar the project also had asocial fund for income-generating activi-ties,and in Senegal an effort to improveaccess to water.The frontline providers in Madagascarincluded women from the targeted neigh-borhoods selected by the communities andsupervised by physicians hired by the pro-jects.Open tendering was used to select thesupervising NGOs in Madagascar.Contrac-tual agreements speci\ufb01ed the services to beprovided and the number of bene\ufb01ciariesto be served,monitored monthly by theuser community and the project.Childhood malnutrition declined signi\ufb01-cantly in both projects.An evaluation inSenegal after 17 months of project imple-mentation showed almost zero prevalenceof severe malnutrition among children aged6\u201311 months and a reduction in moderatemalnutrition from 28 percent to 24 percentamong children aged 6\u201335 months.Source:Marek and others (1999).BOX 8.7The government as active purchaser ofhealthoutcomes through strategic contracting 17_WDR_Ch08.qxd

care,are more dif\ufb01cult to establish.Which services for whom,when,where,how,and how much are dif\ufb01cult to specifyin advance.Effort and quality are not read-ily veri\ufb01able.Providers have more gamingspace.422Targeted payments to increase cer-vical smears in the United Kingdom led to ashort-term increase in the number ofsmears.But in the long term providers reor-ganized their activities so that they wouldcontinue to receive the payments withoutdelivering the services.423Clinical service contracts also take con-siderable capacity to write and enforce.424Purchasing based on output\u2014per visit,percase,per hospital day\u2014causes the quantityofclinical services provided to rise (some-times mainly among better-offgroups) andthe costs to escalate.Health reforms oftentry to contain costs by establishing \ufb01xed-price contracts\u2014capitated payments,orprospective global budgets\u2014using caps tokeep costs down and shifting risks to theprovider.But this leaves to frontlineproviders the responsibility for rationingservices,opening the possibility for cream-skimming.Providers can lower their stan-dard ofcare,deny service,or insist on addi-tional informal fees (box 8.8).Equitable service distribution thenrequires providers to have both the techni-cal capacity to inform the rationing processand a pro-poor ethos to make this processbene\ufb01t the poor\u2014a combination often dif-\ufb01cult to achieve.High- and middle-incomecountries are therefore increasingly delegat-ing the undertaking ofclinical service con-tracts to an autonomous\u2014often paras-tatal\u2014social insurance organization thatnegotiates agreements for services to beprovided.They rely on more sophisticatedcontracts and monitoring systems usingcomplex payment methods:for example,case-based payments in Georgia or diag-nostically related groups in Hungary.Identifying poor target groups andmonitoring results are also more dif\ufb01cultfor clinical care,because needs are moredif\ufb01cult to de\ufb01ne.Cambodia\u2019s contract,which included speci\ufb01c provisions toincrease clinical services for the poor,hadmixed results (spotlight on Cambodia).Incentives for treating those most in needcan be strengthened by calibrating pay-ments to providers on the basis ofimpacton health outcomes,with higher paymentsfor emergency obstetric care,as in BurkinaFaso,or with higher payments for treatingthe poor,as in the Kyrgyz Republic (box8.9).To exempt the poor from fees,how-150WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004\u02c6Ratio of poor to rich for DPT3

andadequate compensation.Contractual arrangements often need tocombine soft capacity-building componentsto meet unserved needs with rewards forperformance.Experience with perfor-mance-based contracts for immunization aspart ofthe Global Alliance for Vaccines andImmunizations shows that zero-based con-tracts and the threat ofresource withdrawalwere not very effective in raising coverage.426Variations across communities can be takeninto account through a two-tier allocationsystem.The \ufb01rst tier can be allocated to alocal government on a capitation basis\u2014asin Argentina,Brazil,Ethiopia,and Poland\u2014and the second tier to an insurance fund or apurchasing agency in charge ofmaximizingthe ef\ufb01ciency ofresources and purchasingan appropriate mix and quantity ofclinicalservices\u2014as in Korea and New Zealand (\ufb01g-ure 8.11).The impact on the poor ofthe changes inprovider payments from input-based tomore complex output-based is not conclu-sive,and there has been little evaluation.Butthe separation ofpolicymaking from pur-chasing and service provision creates clearerchannels ofaccountability.Autonomousproviders have more \ufb02exibility in ensuringthe appropriate input mix including hiringand \ufb01ring,as in Kenya and Zambia.427Pur-chasing bodies are more independent actors,subject to a double line ofaccountabilitybecause they are often \ufb01nanced by govern-ments and households through insurancesystems.Governments need to be involvedin these agencies to de\ufb01ne which services thepoor need most,price the subsidy supportneeded by the poor,and limit providers\u2019con\ufb02icts ofinterest.Selecting providersThere is no presumption that one type ofprovider\u2014public,for-pro\ufb01t,or not-for-pro\ufb01t\u2014is likely to be better than any other.Public health facilities can be remarkablyef\ufb01cient,as in Malaysia,or largely ineffec-tive,as in middle-income Gabon,whereimmunization levels have stalled at under30 percent.Nor are NGOs necessarily pro-poor.When contracted by governments,NGOs also tend to get closer to the publicsector.An autonomous parastatal hospitalin France that enjoys large \ufb01nancial andmanagement \ufb02exibility and an NGO hospi-tal under government contract in Canadaare not very different.For population-oriented services that canbe

thecontract.Government providers deliverhigh immunization rates in Tajikistan orTunisia\u2014but in Cambodia and Haiti so docontracted NGOs.As contractors NGOscan extend service outreach and test newapproaches to service delivery.428To support self-care,private services\u2014whether for-pro\ufb01t or not-for-pro\ufb01t\u2014oftenare most appropriate.Private for-pro\ufb01tproviders can be very ef\ufb01cient in providinginformation and distributing commodi-ties\u2014witness the success ofsocial market-ing.For information and social support,grassroots organizations,small privateproviders,and community-based organiza-tions often do the job better than rigid pub-lic organizations.Governments can con-tract some key services such as information.Yet public services can sometimes be morepro-poor than NGO services.In Cear\xe1,Brazil,\u201cmany NGOs delivered services inclinics while the public service sent itsworkers into households\u201d429(see spotlight).For clinical services the contrast is sharper.Public provision works well when there is astrong public ethos,the politics are pro-poor,and rules are enforced.For-pro\ufb01t pro-viders\u2014quali\ufb01ed or not\u2014are usually in tunewith demand,but the inherent con\ufb02icts ofinterest require external control.In Lebanonand elsewhere,expansion ofthe private sec-tor did not bene\ufb01t the poor much.430InIndia,private providers serving poor groupsare often less than quali\ufb01ed.Governmentscan then exert control only ifthey havesophisticated regulation and purchasingfunctions.When these do not exist,partner-ships between government and civil societyorganizations can compensate by strengthen-ing clients\u2019power over clinical providers.Because not-for-pro\ufb01t organizationsoften bene\ufb01t from strong intrinsic motiva-tion and professional ethos,governmentcan also write open-ended contracts withthem and still expect that providers will dothe right thing.Service delivery by NGOscan help repair the link between policymak-ers and providers for clinical services withsigni\ufb01cant bene\ufb01ts for the poor.InGuatemala,about a third ofthe populationis now served by NGO providers,signi\ufb01-cantly increasing access for indigenous poorpopulations although management andquality problems have been observed.431Regulation and enforcementGovernments can also use market regulationto counter con\ufb02icts ofinterest.In Hungaryaccreditation mechanisms have been quitesuccessful in establishing quality criteria forproviders.To reduce supplier-induced over-supply and compensate for the lack ofinvest-ment in poorer settings,most countries usecerti\ufb01cates ofneeds (in United States),plan-ning boards (Australia),or health maps(Spain and most ofAfrica).But most low-income countries do not regulate their phar-maceutical market successfully,thoughCambodia has had some success.When reg-ulation fails,a combination ofuser educa-tion and provider training can yield thegreatest bene\ufb01ts.432Government involve-ment through national tendering,price cap-ping,or tariffreduction has also in\ufb02uencedthe prices ofpharmaceuticals.433Overall theenforcement ofregulatory controls is oftenweak,focusing mainly on personnel licens-ing.The same political and institutional fail-ures hampering health service delivery affectthe legislative,administrative,and judicialservices needed to make regulation work.Expanding access to professional healthcare providers\u2014particularly midwifery,sur-gical skills for reducing maternal mortality,and clinical skills for reducing neonataldeaths\u2014is a priority to reach the MillenniumDevelopment Goals.In many countries theimbalance between rural and urban areas interms ofskilled health workers is extreme.InTurkey,there is one doctor per 266 people inthe richest region and one per 2,609 in thepoorest.In Ghana and Senegal more thanhalfthe physicians are concentrated in thecapital city,where fewer than 20 percent ofpeople live.Health workers lack opportuni-ties in rural areas where turnover is high.Rural workers are less likely to be female andeducated.Lack ofservices (school,water) andaccess to training/education are major incen-tives to leave rural areas.Undifferentiatedsalary structures are disincentives to work inareas where the poor live,because it is dif\ufb01-cult to supplement low salaries with alterna-tive income from activities such as privatepractice,teaching,and consulting.434152WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 200417_WDR_Ch08.qxd  8/14/03  9:53 AM  Page 152\x0c(c)

in ruralareas.In Indonesia doctors were also allowedto supply private services during or after dutyhours.Other countries have tried to establishnew credentials,as for health of\ufb01cers inEthiopia,and trained community workers inIndia and Brazil (spotlight on Cear\xe1).Another approach includes progressivelyupgrading the skills oftraditional providers,such as community midwives in Malaysia,orencouraging the hiring and training ofhealthworkers from underserved areas or socialgroups as done in Indonesia and Iran.In theBangladesh Rural Advancement Committee(BRAC) community workers are trained toseek out the extremely poor in need ofurgentmedical care.But success requires carefuldesign and evaluation.In El Salvador low-skilled health promoters posted in rural vil-lages did little to improve health or health-seeking behavior.436The global crisis in thelabor market for clinical services also requiresinnovative strategies to get professional ser-vices to rural areas and the poor (box 8.10).Health and nutrition services153When the international community set out in1955 to eradicate malaria,Africa was left outbecause it lacked adequately trained person-nel.Today,Africa still lacks such personnel,andyet it must deal with multiple disease-controlefforts.In Burkina Faso,the average number ofphysicians per 100,000 people was 3.4 in the1990s compared with 303 for nine industrialcountries.In Zambia the already low number ofphysicians,at 8.3 per 100,000 people in the1960s,declined to 6.9 in the 1990s.To meet therequirements of the priority health interven-tions recommended by the World Health Orga-nization,Chad would require a sevenfoldincrease in health personnel.High rates of absenteeism re\ufb02ect disenchant-ment with working conditions.Studies of healthprofessionals in Ghana,India,Mozambique,Tanza-nia,and Uganda show that the health workforce\u2014nurses and physicians in particular\u2014feeloverworked and underappreciated.In Guinea,Mauritania,Poland,and Russia health staff wageshave declined in real terms.There has been considerable emigration ofhealth professionals from developing countries.More than 600 South African doctors are regis-tered in New Zealand,at a cost to South Africantaxpayers of roughly $37 million.An estimated61 percent of Ghanaian doctors trained between1985 and 1994 left the country.Nurses are leav-ing too:in 2001 the United Kingdom approved22,462 work permits for nurses from developingcountries.To retain internationally marketable healthstaff,poor countries will have to offerinternationally competitive wages and bene\ufb01ts.That requires replacing in\ufb02exible civil servicepolicies with more \ufb02exible approaches.Trainingspeci\ufb01cally oriented to national markets can alsohelp.Countries that emulate the training stan-dards of industrial countries tend to be more vul-nerable to poaching (Ghana).There is evidencefrom Ethiopia and the Gambia that communitynurses and health of\ufb01cers with curricula notinternationally certi\ufb01ed are less likely to migrate.BOX 8.10The human resource crisis in health services Human resources constraints for

DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004In the words of a professor of midwifery,\u201cMidwives should be able to take on a moreenabled,\u2018for women\u2019role.This then has implica-tions for regulation,which should be \u2018self regu-lated\u2019to a point\u2014but should also have input tothat process from women themselves,and fromfellow professionals....Midwives should be veryinvolved in the process,...but if they are the onlyones involved,the danger is that a \u2018for midwife\u2019culture develops,protecting midwives and per-petuating problems....The formal process canalso be backed up by a less formal process (i.e.peer review) to ensure lots of midwife to midwifecontact and learning.This \u2018with-women/for-women\u2019stance can then form a foundation forwhat \u2018professionalism\u2019looks like for midwifery....We need to be able to form a contract,...and fol-low up on it,all the time respecting woman\u2019sindividuality and the culture in which she lives.This all implies enough education to do this well,and enough power to in\ufb02uence the system.Thisis what I would describe as \u2018professional\u2019.\u201dSources:ICM (2003) and Davies (2001).BOX 8.11Developing a professional ethos in midwiferyThe complexity and dispersed nature ofclinical health services and the potential forcon\ufb02icts ofinterest make self-monitoring byproviders critical for effective service deliv-ery.Historically,peer regulation has been thecommon response to a con\ufb02ict ofinterest.But because ofstate dominance in manycountries,professional bodies are fairlyweak.Provider-driven changes in the organi-zation ofservice provision can yield substan-tial bene\ufb01ts for clients,as in initiatives suchas Health Workers for Change.437The Ger-man health system is largely self-regulated.Professional associations in Zimbabwemaintain professional ethics and standardsamong public and private nurses.438Associa-tions ofmidwives in Guatemala and NewZealand develop and promote a pro-poorethos (box 8.11).Information and monitoringDecentralization,devolution,and output-based contracting ofservices increase theimportance oftimely and accurate informa-tion for monitoring performance.Nationaland international statistics do not yet capturethe range ofpractices or the performance ofall health care providers.Most ministries ofhealth know little about the private sector,which makes it hard to develop partnershipsor contracts,although countries are attempt-ing to conduct provider surveys as inPoland.439Information on access,quality,andef\ufb01ciency is scarce and often noncomparable.And because many factors outside the healthsector affect health status,cross-sectoralmonitoring and planning are also required,asThailand\u2019s National Economic and SocialDevelopment Board does regularly.Monitoring ofaverage outcomes or ser-vice utilization patterns often does not revealwhere change is occurring.Changes in fertil-ity rates and contraceptive use in most Sub-Saharan countries in the 1990s have beenconcentrated in the urban,richest popula-tion segments.In Tanzania the declining useofskilled delivery care between 1993 and1999 can be attributed mainly to declininguse among the poorest groups.When col-lecting information on income is dif\ufb01cult,alternative indicators can be used,such asethnicity,caste,region,gender,linguisticgroup,or religion.Countries as different asColombia,Indonesia,Iran,Mexico,and thePhilippines use community maps to identifyhigh-risk individuals and households inneed ofhome visits and special attention.440Six

providers.Their complaints can gothrough the health system\u2014such as thepoliclinic that coordinates the local healthfacilities,the municipal health council,orhospital administrators.Or they can gothrough political channels\u2014say,to the localrepresentative ofthe People\u2019s Power Assem-bly,which is required to respond.Despitethis monitoring,there is limited direct citi-zen control:participation in administrativeand health councils does not entail muchmore than setting broad targets.447Like-wise,citizens play only a small role in set-ting priorities within the health sector,andbetween health and other sectors.Can Cuba sustain the system?The 1990s were dif\ufb01cult for Cuba.The col-lapse ofthe socialist system in Europe andin the Soviet Union and the tightening ofthe economic embargo by the United Statesled to a severe economic contraction.Cubalost the trading partners that had providedmost ofits imports ofmedicines,food,fuel,and equipment used in agriculture andmining.Between 1988 and 1993 imports ofmedicines fell by more than 60 percent.By1994 agricultural production had fallen byalmost half.Drug shortages persist today.448Government spending on social ser-vices,particularly health care,was pro-engaged in international solidarity missionsraise their pro\ufb01le and contribute to a senseofpride in Cuba\u2019s doctors.Cuba also keeps close track ofwhat\u2019sgoing on in health facilities.Monitoring isstrong,with information \ufb02owing in manydirections.The main elements are:\u2022An integrated national health statisticssystem that collects data routinely fromservice providers.Indicators ofparticu-lar concern,such as infant mortality,arecollected with high frequency\u2014someeven daily.\u2022Regular inspection of,and supervisionvisits to,health facilities.\u2022Annual evaluations ofhealth techni-cians on the technical and scienti\ufb01cresults oftheir work.In addition,a ran-domly selected sample undergoes exter-nal evaluation.\u2022Annual reports by the Ministry ofPub-lic Health and the provincial andmunicipal health directorates to thePeople\u2019s Power Assembly.Monitoring and evaluation go beyondstatistical and expert assessments.Publicdissemination ofhealth indicators,at theend ofeach year,draws citizens into theprocess.In addition,citizens can complaintected,with public spending on healthexceeding 10 percent ofGDP in 2000.Butin real terms,spending had gone down.Health outcome indicators worsened in theearly and mid-1990s,recovering only some-what by the end ofthe decade.As health infrastructure suffered,so didtransport services.Public transport had allbut disappeared by the early 1990s,and fuelshortages limited the use ofprivate cars.Cubans resorted to walking miles to work,and the use ofbicycles skyrocketed.449The economic reversal also appears tobe weakening motivation among staff.Physicians are paid relatively well,earningalmost 15 percent more than the averagenational wage.450But their pay is in localcurrency,with purchasing power decliningsteadily over the past decade.The legaliza-tion ofa separate \u201cdollar economy\u201dhasmade occupations that pay in dollarshighly prized.Stories ofdoctors shirkingtheir formal duties to join this paralleleconomy\u2014driving taxicabs,for example\u2014are common.451Time will tell whether an approach thatrelies on a publicly paid doctor for every150 families can be sustained in times ofeconomic hardship\u2014and with competitionfrom an economy that relies more on thedollar.18_pgs

roads,and urban transportin\ufb02uence human development outcomes(crate 1.1).As with education and healthservices,the impact ofinfrastructure ser-vices on human development is direct (e.g.,reducing water-related diseases,which rankamong the top killers ofchildren).Theimpact is also indirect,through economicgrowth.452But like education and health,these services are failing poor people.Focusing on water,sanitation,and elec-tricity services,this chapter uses the Report\u2019sservice delivery framework to \ufb01nd out whyand to show how things might be improved.The reform lessons from these services,rep-resenting both network and non-networkservices,are also likely to apply to otherinfrastructure services.For networked services,such as urbanwater and electricity,regulating providersand ensuring that poor people have access toaffordable services are the main reasons forgovernment intervention.This brings thelong route ofaccountability into play.Butpoor citizens have a weak voice because waterand electricity are particularly vulnerable topatronage politics.Providers end up beingmore accountable to policymakers than toclients,which breaks the long route ofaccountability.The solution is to separate the policy-makers from the providers\u2014and to makeproviders more responsive to clients.Dis-persing ownership through decentraliza-tion and private participation,promotingcompetition through benchmarking,ensur-ing alternative access by using independentproviders,and charging for services areways ofseparating policymakers fromproviders and strengthening compacts,client power,and voice.In rural network and non-network set-tings,community and self-provision domi-nate.The policymaker as standard setterand capacity builder in support ofthe clientis missing.To avoid ensuing problems,suchas arsenic in Bangladesh\u2019s rural drinkingwater,policymakers need to support clientsin ensuring service quality and access.Externalities in sanitation in rural,non-network settings are best contained within thevillage or community.So supply-side supportat the household level should be comple-mented with interventions at the communitylevel\u2014be it information about hygiene orsubsidization oflatrines\u2014that are designed tospur household demand and create commu-nity peer pressure for behavior that internal-izes the externalities.In urban settings,wheredemand for sanitation services may be greater,property rights and facilitating privateresponse can support collective efforts.The state of water and sanitation servicesAbout 2 ofevery 10 people in the developingworld were without access to safe water in2000;5 of10 lived without adequate sanita-tion;and 9 of10 lived without their waste-water treated in any way.453There have beengains,but despite the many global commit-ments,notably the U.N.Decade for Waterand Sanitation,access to water and sanitationlags far behind the milestones set in the1980s.Nor do aggregate trends in the 1990sgive comfort (\ufb01gure 9.1).The share ofpeoplewith access to these services in Africa andAsia\u2014where the world\u2019s poor are concen-trated\u2014has fallen,remained constant,orincreased only slowly.Innumerable city and town studies con-\ufb01rm the UN-Habitat Report\u2019s key messageDrinking water,sanitation,and electricity9chapter19_WDR_Ch09.qxd  8/14/03  10:01

communities.454Full-pressure,\u201c24-7\u201dwater supply remains a pipe dreamin many cities.Because a quarter to half(and more) ofurban water supply remainsunaccounted for,many cities are turnedinto leaking buckets (\ufb01gure 9.2).The lim-ited number ofnetwork access points mustbe widely shared,which dramaticallyincreases waiting times and often simplyoverwhelms the system.Rural infrastruc-ture often goes to seed:more than a third ofexisting rural infrastructure in South Asia isestimated to be dysfunctional.455Poor people bear a disproportionateshare ofthe impact ofinef\ufb01cient water andsanitation services.Fewer poor people areconnected to a network.When they do haveaccess,the installation has to be sharedamong many more people (\ufb01gure 9.3).Andthe prices they pay are among the highest,generally more than those paid by moreaf\ufb02uent households connected to the pipedsystem (\ufb01gure 9.4).The price differential ispartly a result ofinef\ufb01ciencies\u2014theinequitable practice ofsubsidizing pipedwater,lack ofscale economies for indepen-dent providers,or worse,providers takingadvantage ofpoor people\u2019s lack ofchoice.But some ofthe price differential can alsore\ufb02ect the \ufb02exibility and convenience ofservices offered by independent pro-viders\u2014no connection charges or access toquantities ofwater that are more affordablefor poor people.Infrastructure and theaccountability framework for service deliveryCountries are trying different approaches toaddress failing water,sanitation,and electric-ity services.These include decentralizing tolocal governments,private sector participa-tion,regulatory reform,community-drivendevelopment,and small independentproviders.Some approaches try to make ser-vices work for poor people through targetedinterventions.Others seek to improve ser-vices overall\u2014on the premise that makingservices work for all is necessary for makingthem work for poor people.The sameapproach has worked in one setting andfailed in another,and different approacheshave worked in seemingly the same setting.What is needed is a way to think about theinstitutional and political characteristics ofinfrastructure services to understand whatworks where and why.Accountability in infrastructureservicesChapters 3\u20136 ofthis Report develop a frame-work for analyzing how well the actors in

ofaccountability.In a simplemarket transaction,the buyer holds theseller accountable for the product bought,rewards the seller by repeating business,orpenalizes the seller by choosing anotherprovider.This accountability is \u201cshort\u201dbecause the client can hold the providerdirectly accountable,without any interme-diaries.Small,independent providers inwater and sanitation and their clients areusually in such a market relationship.In Dar-es-Salaam,Tanzania,a choleraoutbreak in 1996 forced the sewerage andsanitation department to loosen itsmonopoly on cesspit cleaning and allowprivate providers in.There is now anemerging competitive private market forcesspit cleaning\u2014households can choose aprovider based on price and (easy-to-mon-itor) performance.Besides allowing entryand implementing regulations on sewagedisposal,the city\u2019s role has been small.456But service and market conditions thatautomatically give clients power\u2014throughchoice,ease ofmonitoring,and marketenforceability\u2014are not always present forinfrastructure services.So the route ofaccountability has to be long.Long route ofaccountability.Govern-ments worldwide deem it their responsibil-ity to provide,\ufb01nance,regulate,and inother ways in\ufb02uence infrastructure services.They do it for two good reasons:marketfailures and equity concerns.First,net-worked

externalities come literallyfrom spillovers.Yes,households in Dar-es-Salaam were willing to pay for improvedsanitation with larger health bene\ufb01ts to thecity.But free-rider problems,where oneperson\u2019s behavior hurts others withimpunity\u2014as in the case ofrunofffromopen defecation in many parts ofAsia andAfrica\u2014require community or governmentintervention.Second,societies care aboutequity,and governments often redistributeresources\u2014such as a lifeline water sub-sidy\u2014to ensure the minimum equitableservice access that markets cannot.Network externalities,collective actionproblems,and distributional goals thusprovide powerful reasons for the govern-ment to be involved.The arrangementsthen are no longer primarily between theclient and the provider,and new account-ability relationships become important.The \ufb01rst ofthese arrangements is voice\u2014citizens delegating to politicians the respon-sibility to ensure the infrastructure ser-vices they want.The second is through thecompacts between policymakers andproviders\u2014to design the service deliveryframework,choose a provider,and ensurethat it meets citizen expectations.Voice andcompacts together become the \u201clong route\u201dofaccountability.In Bangladesh the primeminister and her power minister are,inprinciple,accountable to citizens for theperformance ofthe Power DevelopmentBoard,a corporation owned and operatedby government.The short and long routes ofaccountabil-ity need to work together.Indeed,even forcesspit services in Dar-es-Salaam,govern-ment regulation was necessary to ensure thatthe small private operators complementedthe public provider and complied withsewage disposal guidelines.Effective solu-tions are likely to be a strategic mixture oftheshort and long routes ofaccountability as asystemin which the clients,the policymaker,and the provider are linked in accountabilityrelationships that make services work forpoor people.Why infrastructure services fail poorpeople: patronageBecause the family has been without daytimewater for the past decade,the children have neverseen water come out oftheir home

ofManila\u2019s public water agency,Metro-Manila Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS),in 1997Where water,sanitation,and electricity arepublicly managed,the accountability to cit-izens is achieved when the state ensures thatutilities,boards,and government depart-ments provide ef\ufb01cient and equitable ser-vices for all citizens,including the poor.When the state is unsuccessful and the voicerelationship is not effective,the long routeofaccountability has failed.In 1997 the MWSS was typical ofserviceutilities,boards,and government depart-ments that consider politicians and policy-makers as their real clients.Politicians\u2014responding to equity concerns or,morelikely,to short-term political gain\u2014oftenkeep prices for infrastructure services wellbelow those for cost recovery.This makesservice providers dependent on politicallymotivated budget transfers for survival\u2014orwhen transfers are not forthcoming,on ser-vice cutbacks that attract no penalties frompolicymakers.State-owned water and electricity pro-viders then cease to function as auton-omous service providers.457They become162WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Figure 9.5Accountability in

Bank\n\nextensions ofpolicymakers.The policy-maker and provider begin to fuse into onerole.When this happens,policymakers canno longer hold providers accountable fordelivering to all citizens,services deterio-rate,and poor citizens as clients are leftpowerless.The dynamics ofthis relationship can beeven more debilitating for poor clients.Over time providers become a strong polit-ical force,in\ufb02uencing the policymaker.Ineffect,providers capture the policymakingprocess,exerting pressures through orga-nized labor or their ability to control servicedelivery for the politician.With deteriorat-ing service levels,policymakers andproviders ration access.This has an impor-tant implication when lumpy investmentsare needed to gain access to services\u2014whether through an electricity grid,a vil-lage water network,or even a stand-alonesystem,such as tubewells.Citizens or theirgroups respond to rationed access by sup-porting politicians who favor them as theirclients over politicians who push for uni-versal access.This strengthens the ability ofpoliticians to use patronage.The account-ability linking clients,politicians,policy-makers,and providers is displaced bypatron-client relationships\u2014clientelism\u2014on both legs ofthe long route ofaccount-ability (box 9.1).458In such settings,the breakdown in voicefor poor citizens is reinforced by their

client needs.Politicians exert their control by appointing (and dis-missing) company directors and by providing publicsubsidies to \ufb01nance investments and prop up ailingenterprises.In return for this patronage,water com-panies are often obliged to supply political favors inthe form of excess employment,the depressing oftariffs,political targeting of new investments,andthe distribution of contracts on the basis of politicalcriteria.The consequences:spiraling costs,low ser-vice quality,and precarious \ufb01nances.The scarcity ofresources for investment leaves much of the popu-lace without adequate services and forces them torely on expensive or inconvenient alternatives.The clientelist model broadly describes the poli-tics of urban and rural regional utilities in both waterand

to?Question asked ofthe Managing Director ofthe Hyderabad Water Board by a consumer,Hyderabad,September 2002In cities and towns,where scale economiesprevail,water systems have major networksuppliers\u2014generally a public sector provider,such as the Lagos water board in Nigeria,or asmall municipal water department,as in Cha-pai Nawabganj in Bangladesh.Some oftheseproviders belong to local governments\u2014as inthe case ofthe Johannesburg water utility;some to a state government\u2014as is commonin India;and some\u2014like MWSS in Manila\u2014to central governments.For all,the relevantquestions are whether there is a clear delin-eation ofroles between the policymaker andthe provider\u2014and whom the provider isaccountable to,the policymaker or the client?When voice and politics fail,the distinctionbetween the two is blurred,and the provider isaccountable to the policymaker.Four reform strategies can potentially sep-arate policymakers and providers:decentral-izing assets,using private participation inoperations,charging for services,and relyingon independent providers to give clientschoice.The \ufb01rst two aim to in\ufb02uence com-pacts,the second two to strengthen clientpower.All are politically dif\ufb01cult to imple-ment.That is not surprising,since strongpolitical forces\u2014not technocratic failures\u2014blur the roles ofpolicymakers and providers.The issue is whether these strategies can pro-vide incentives to remove patronage and com-pensate for the weak voice ofpoor people.Strengthening the compact:decentralizing assetsDevolving responsibilities to different tiers ofpolicymakers and separating powers betweenthem can create the right incentives toimprove service delivery.First,by having ser-vice and political boundaries better coincide,decentralization can strengthen voice andaccountability.Second,when the center is incharge ofboth regulatory and service deliveryresponsibilities,it has few incentives to holditselfaccountable.Devolving services toanother tier ofpolicymaker triggers incentivesmore compatible with having the center (or anupper-tier government) oversee the regulatoryframework.Finally,devolution creates anopportunity to benchmark performance anduse \ufb01scal resources and reputation as rewardsto support ef\ufb01cient service provision.The con-testability for resources in this context requiresa tier with \ufb01scal capacity and without serviceprovision responsibilities\u2014appropriate forthe center (or a state in a federal system).Devolving responsibilities to local gov-ernments has had mixed results in waterand sanitation,often leading to the loss ofscale economies,eroding commercial via-bility by excessive fragmentation,and evenconstitutional con\ufb02icts between municipal-ities and upper-tier governments.459Thehistorical experience ofindustrial countriesoffers lessons for addressing these problems(box 9.2).164WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004In France water assets have historically beendevolved to the commune\u2014the lowest tier ofgovernment.Clusters of communes have inte-grated the industry by delegating water andsanitation services \u201cupward\u201dto private or semi-public companies.The functional boundaries ofthe companies cut across several communes,which continue to own the assets but contractout the management of services.In the United States water and sanitationassets are also devolved to local governments.Where local governments have been carved upinto small political jurisdictions and individualwater works are impractical,privately ownedcompanies have emerged to provide regionalservices covering several local governments.Examples include Elizabeth and Hackensack,both in New Jersey.Interestingly,for France and some areas in theUnited States,the limited capacity of the smallerlocal governments provided the incentives for pri-vate companies to serve clusters of political juris-dictions.In both France and the United States themultijurisdictional coverage prevents the waterprovider from being captured by any one localbody\u2014thus maintaining the separation fromlocal policymakers.The approach was different in England andthe Netherlands.At the outset of the 20th cen-tury in both countries,oversight and direct pro-vision of water services were in the hands oflocal authorities.In the Netherlands these wereunder company structures,mostly owned andrun by municipalities,but many were under pri-vate operation if not ownership.In England thenational government consolidated the localwater systems into regional bodies,movingfrom 1,400 in World War II to 187 in 1974 and 10in the 1980s,all eventually privatized.In theNetherlands,also under central governmentmandate,the municipal companies were con-verted to regional companies to support theexpansion of services to rural areas.But thecompanies remained under the ownership ofmunicipalities and provinces.Sources:Lorrain (1992);Seidenstat,Haarmeyer,andHakim (2002);Jacobson and Tarr (1996).BOX 9.2Decentralization and the water industry\u2014in history19_WDR_Ch09.qxd  8/14/03  10:03 AM  Page 164\x0c(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank\n\nFragmentation and the loss ofscaleeconomies can be partly addressed by permit-ting interjurisdictional agreements.In theFrench syndicatmodel,municipal jurisdic-tions can cede the right to provide water andsanitation services to a company jointly ownedby several local authorities.Bolivia\u2019s water lawexplicitly allows for multi-municipal compa-nies.Colombia empowered its regulator toenforce mergers ofnonviable local water agen-cies,but ironically exempted the smallest ofthe municipalities that would have bene\ufb01tedmost from this rule.Brazil\u2019s state companieswere created through voluntary agreementswith municipalities,\ufb01nanced by central funds.These examples suggest an importantapproach for aligning general decentraliza-tion with sectoral priorities.When authorityis being decentralized,a window usuallyopens for central government to in\ufb02uencethe restructuring oflocal services.Decentral-ization gives the center the ability to negotiatethe restructuring ofdevolved assets through\ufb01scal incentives\u2014say,by deciding to retainthe liabilities while devolving only the assets.Where devolution has already happened,the center can provide incentives such as\ufb01scal grants to subnational governmentsthat are dependent on milestones ofinstitu-tional reform.Australia\u2019s federal govern-ment provided grants to states to reform thewater sector.The South African govern-ment is also using central \ufb01scal incentives tosupport municipal restructuring and toin\ufb02uence reform ofurban services,includ-ing water and sanitation.India\u2019s federalgovernment is exploring a similar policyinstrument\u2014the City Challenge Fund\u2014tocreate incentives for general urban reform,including municipal services.Such \ufb01scal incentives are more effective ifallocated competitively to local tiers ofgov-ernment.But this requires information so thecenter can compare the performance ofdif-ferent local governments,promoting compe-tition and accountability.It also requires thatthe policy and legal framework enable localgovernments to have the \ufb02exibility to reformservice delivery\u2014to form regional compa-nies and use contracting,for example.Coun-tries such as Pakistan and South Africa thathave recently embarked on decentralizationhave adopted such legislation.The bottom line:upper-tier governmentscan in\ufb02uence the design ofcompacts at thelocal level through legislation and incentives.However,as demonstrated by experience inLatin America,decentralization processeshave not always been designed with suf\ufb01-cient care to allow these kinds ofbene\ufb01ts tobe reaped.The success ofmanaging servicereforms during decentralization will dependon whether broader decentralization policiescan ensure that local politicians and policy-makers bear the consequences ofpolicy deci-sions.Ensuring that decentralization canseparate policymakers and providers at thelocal level requires that it also separate rolesand responsibilities ofthe different tiers ofgovernment (chapter 10).Without that sepa-ration,decentralization may simply transferpatronage to local levels.Strengthening the compact: using private participation in operationsOver the past decade,private participationhas grown signi\ufb01cantly in water,sanitation,and electricity in different forms and acrossmany regions (box 9.3).In general,privateparticipation in infrastructure has beenadvocated for many reasons,includingaccessing management expertise and privateinvestment and introducing incentives in theoperations ofinfrastructure services.Privateparticipation is also a direct way ofseparat-ing policymakers and service providersthrough two aspects ofthe accountabilitychain\u2014compacts and voice.In the design ofcompacts,private pro-viders generally require explicit contractsthat de\ufb01ne up front the service responsibili-ties ofthe provider and the policymaker,theregulatory and tariffparameters,and issuesofaccess by poor households.In addition,the process ofcontracting private providerscan strengthen the voice channel,particu-larly ifadvocacy groups and public informa-tion mechanisms are involved in the process.Indeed,service delivery standards and ser-vices for poor people are often explicit in thepolicy debate on private participation inwater and sanitation.In many industrial countries the involve-ment ofthe private sector in service deliv-ery enabled governments to develop theDrinking water,sanitation,and electricity16519_WDR_Ch09.qxd  8/14/03  10:04 AM  Page 165\x0c(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank\n\nPrivate

water in public and pri-vate contexts (box 9.4).But in today\u2019s devel-oping countries private participation is being\ufb02ung into a context ofinstitutional rigidity,not necessarily conducive to the organicgrowth offormal private participation.Using private provision to drive a wedge intopatronage makes managing private partici-pation intensely political\u2014but potentiallypowerful for increasing accountability.The proofofthis potential is already evi-dent.Formal private participation in waterand sanitation has led to greater demand foraccountability\u2014this,despite accounting for asmall part oftotal investment in water andsanitation.During the 1990s private invest-ment accounted for only 15 percent oftotalinvestment in water and sanitation,coveringless than 10 percent ofthe world\u2019s population.Even in Latin America,where private provi-sion has made the greatest inroads in thewater sector,it only covers 15 percent ofthecontinent\u2019s urban population.460In addition,in contrast to electricity,for example,publicownership and not divestiture ofassetsremains the norm in the sector.Ulitmately,like decentralization,privateprovision offers an opportunity to in\ufb02uencethe relationships ofaccountability.And likedecentralization,its success depends ondesign and implementation (box 9.5).Experi-ence so far suggests that regulation and infor-mation\u2014two interlinked parts ofoverall sec-tor reform\u2014are important in successfullyimplementing private sector participation inwater,sanitation,and electricity sectors and inpromoting greater voice in service delivery.Regulation.A regulatory system in thisReport\u2019s framework is best de\ufb01ned along thedimensions ofaccountability between the pol-icymaker and the provider\u2014delegation ofresponsibilities and \ufb01nance,informationabout the performance ofthe provider,andenforcement (chapter 3).The regulator couldbe responsible for speci\ufb01c elements oftheaccountability chain\u2014just providing informa-tion on performance or also ensuring enforce-ment.Sometimes the policymaker is the regu-lator,and sometimes a dedicated third partyhas this responsibility.Sometimes even anassociation ofproviders can self-regulate.Whichever method is followed,the regulatoryDrinking water,sanitation,and electricity167England.In London private companies sup-plied water for more than 400 years with littlegovernment restriction on entry.Companiescompeted against each other,invested inservice and quality innovations,and increasedhousehold connections.By the 19th centuryLondon\u2019s extensive water system helped makethat city \u201cone of the best housed and healthiestcities in Europe,with a death rate lower thanbirth rate by about 1800,at a time when mostEuropean cities were devourers of men.\u201dNinety-\ufb01ve percent of London residents received pipedsupply from the private companies,and a major-ity had direct home connection.Technological change led to signi\ufb01cantprice competition,industry consolidation,andhigher prices.And the improved water supplyincreased demand for \ufb02ush toilets,whichcreated problems of sewage removal.Parliament responded with regulation,and by1908 the private system was nationalized.", u"['SDG_3', 'SDG_6', 'SDG_7', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_16', 'SDG_17'])Holland.Between 1853 and 1920 the watersector was dominated by private water supplycompanies,which were then progressivelytaken over by municipalities and operated aspublic utilities.The amalgamation waspromoted by central regulation and facilitatedby municipal politics.A major motivation was touse the companies to deliver services moreregionally to rural areas.By the time the publicsector took over,principles of economic man-agement of water services had become wellembedded in the political system.Arms-lengthmanagement of public utilities by municipalitiesbecame the norm.United States.Between 1800 and 1900,U.S.cities experienced a tremendous growth ofwater works.Initially dominated by private own-ers,half of them were public by 1900.The shiftto public ownership emerged because of con-tracting problems between municipalities andcompanies over water for \ufb01re \ufb01ghting.The dif\ufb01-culties of establishing contracts when citieswere growing rapidly,and several urban con\ufb02a-grations,offered opportunities for both privatecompanies and governments to evade perfor-mance targets or force renegotiations ofcontracts.A lack of metering and direct charg-ing led to con\ufb02icts over \ufb01scal transfers frommunicipalities to companies.Not surprisingly,public ownership increased,and with it the pub-lic system inherited the tradition of managingand regulating water as an economic good.France.Starting with private provision ofwater at the local government level and main-taining it from the mid-1600s onward,Franceevolved toward public ownership and privateprovision through different types ofmanagement and lease contracts.The reasons:scale issues (small local authorities),the historyof the French legal system,and the role of voicein controlling policymakers.The issue of \ufb01re\ufb01ghting did not come up in France,perhapsbecause cities were built with vastly differentmaterials and densities.Sources:Tynan (2002),Schwartz and Maarten(2002),Crocker and Mastens

Bank\n\nprocess has to separate policymaker andprovider and preserve its own independence.Organizing regulation: one size does not \ufb01tall.Where voice is strong and supported byan effective legal system,the policymakersand the judiciary do the regulating.In France,where the compact for water is betweenmunicipal policymakers and a private com-pany,regulation is done primarily throughmunicipal monitoring ofcontracts,withsome support from central authorities.In countries without a tradition ofsepa-rating policymakers and providers and withdiscretionary policymaking,credible regula-tion requires a third party\u2014an agency\u2014toset or interpret regulatory rules.Several for-mal safeguards can support the indepen-dence ofa regulatory agency from politicalin\ufb02uence.461Some examples:earmarkingfunds for the regulatory agency,hiring stafffrom the market without being restricted bycivil service rules (competence and capacityare important elements ofgaining credibilityand independence),ensuring that the hiringand \ufb01ring ofregulators are protected fromthe political interference ofthe executive andlegislative branches,and not linking theterms ofstaffto electoral cycles.A multi-tiered governmental structureoffers additional scope for protecting the inde-pendence ofa regulator by placing it at thenational level,or at the state level ifpolicymak-ing and provision are done at the local level.Another option in a multi-tiered governmentis to use local regulation but have the appealsprocess at a different level.In the United Statesthe Constitution provides an overall frame-work for property rights while state regulatorycommissions oversee the operations ofpri-vately owned local utilities.Local governmentsregulate public utilities directly.Regulation and sector reform.The account-ability framework clari\ufb01es the conditionsunder which a regulator will be effective insupporting sector reforms.Just as account-ability is blurred ifany one ofits relationshipsis broken (see chapter 3),the effectiveness ofa regulator is abridged ifdelegation ofresponsibilities and \ufb01nance between the stateand the provider is incomplete.That is thecase in the electricity sector in some states inIndia.In other words,an independent regula-tor is needed to enforce the separationbetween policymaker and provider,but iftheseparation is not initiated through generalreform to begin with,the regulator may wellbe ineffective.A regulator cannot substitutefor broader sector reforms.At the same time an effective regulator canhelp sustain sector reform.A recent study ofabout 1,000 concessions in Latin Americashowed that even a moderately well-func-168WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004In the 1990s Argentina embarked on one of thelargest privatization campaigns in the world aspart of a structural reform plan.The programincluded local water companies coveringapproximately 30 percent of the country\u2019smunicipalities.Child mortality fell by 5\u20137percent in areas that privatized their water ser-vices.The largest gains were seen in the poorestmunicipalities,where child mortality fell by 24percent.Overall,privatization of water servicesprevented approximately 375 deaths of youngchildren each year.Aggregate data from other sources on thedistribution of new water connection byincome quintile from three countries in LatinAmerica con\ufb01rm the results of the pro-poorimpact of private sector services.As the datashow,25\u201330 percent of the network expansionwas targeted at the lowest 20 percent of theincome pro\ufb01le.Responding to the need for alternatives forreaching poor people,one of the Manila conces-sionaires has developed a system for water deliv-ery in densely populated,hard-to-reach slumareas.In the Bayan Tubig (\u201cWater for the Commu-nity\u201d) program,the use of appropriate technologi-cal standards,client participation in maintenance,and community-based organizations in interme-diation and mapping of the network reducedwater costs for poor families by up to 25 percent.To increase affordability,the concessionaire hasintroduced an interest-free repayment schemeover a period of 6 to 24 months.Between 1991and 2001,the program provided water connec-tions to more than 50,000 households\u2014thisdespite the fact that the contract of one of theManila concessionaires is under review.Source:Galiani,Gertler,and Schargrodsky (2002);Water and Sanitation Program (WSP-AF) (2003).BOX 9.5Private participation in water and sanitation can save poor people\u2019s lives,and

opportunisticrenegotiations ofcontracts.462The study con-cludes that where a regulatory body exists in acountry,the probability ofa renegotiation is17 percent;where none exists,the probabilityis 60 percent.Regulating the public sector.Sector regula-tion is often discussed in the context ofpri-vate sector participation.But issues ofmonopoly behavior and service performanceare also relevant for public sector provision\u2014perhaps even more,because the contractsbetween the policymaker and the publicprovider are often not explicit.Independentregulation ofpublic providers is thereforeequally important.But unless publicproviders have operational \ufb02exibility and arebrought under explicit compacts\u2014andunless all the relationships ofaccountabilityare applied\u2014it is not clear how regulation ofthe public providers would have an impacton service standards.In particular,becausemost ofthe instruments ofmodern regula-tion are based on \ufb01nancial incentives,in theabsence ofuser charges regulation ofpublicproviders would be ineffective.In Chile pub-lic sector regulation was introduced in thecontext ofsector reforms,which includedgreater provider autonomy in operations andeconomic pricing ofwater.This helped cat-alyze regulatory capacity in the public sec-tor\u2014an important asset,now that Chile hasprivatized water services.The role ofinformation.With private provi-sion more needs to be done to deliver on thedemand for greater voice\u2014informing com-munities about the why and how ofprivatesector contracting.A public opinion poll inPeru found support for privatization ofelec-tricity among only 21 percent ofthe citizens.But when informed that privatization was tobe undertaken through a transparent processand tariffincreases would be regulated,sup-port increased to 60 percent.463In Manila theconcession process was preceded by a wide-spread public campaign by President Ramos,who convened \u201cWater Summits\u201dto bringtogether different stakeholders.464In SouthAfrica Johannesburg\u2019s water managementcontract was also undertaken after signi\ufb01-cant\u2014and often dif\ufb01cult\u2014consultation withcommunities,labor unions,and other interestgroups.Neither process was \ufb02awless,but bothopened the door to greater accountability.Anopen process is needed to broaden the partici-pation ofcommunities in the policy debateon private provision\u2014otherwise narrowinterest groups can capture the informationand representation.Community involvement is also essentialin the regulatory process\u2014but it has not beensuf\ufb01ciently encouraged.A review ofurbanwater utilities in Latin America and Africaconcludes that giving consumers little infor-mation about the process ofreform and tariffsetting\u2014and limiting their opportunity forcomment before taking regulatory deci-sions\u2014weaken the regulatory process andthe credibility ofreform,and make tariffchanges\u2014however justi\ufb01ed\u2014dif\ufb01cult toimplement.465Organizing consumers is,however,not aneasy task.There are major free-rider (andrelated \ufb01nancing) problems in developingcountries that prevent consumers from orga-nizing themselves to a degree where they canbe an articulate voice in the regulatoryprocess.The problem is even more severe forpoor consumers.In industrialized countries,relatively well-developed consumer associa-tions perform this role reasonably effectively.Where competent and effective consumerassociations are absent,the asymmetrybetween consumers and providers becomesmore acute,and the regulator risks being cap-tured by the provider.Examples exist ofregulatory bodies engag-ing communities\u2014especially poor communi-ties\u2014more actively.In Jamaica the regulatorreaches out to communities through localchurches;in some cases in Brazil special con-sultative or advisory bodies have been created;and in Peru regulators have made extensiveuse ofthe radio to engage and communicatewith communities.466But these are few exam-ples only\u2014much more needs to be learnedabout how to organize and access communi-ties in the regulation ofservices.Managing private participation also re-quires information on how private playersare performing relative to their contractand the performance ofother public andprivate providers.This information,whichis critical for regulators,also strengthens theDrinking water,sanitation,and electricity16919_WDR_Ch09.qxd  8/14/03  10:06 AM  Page 169\x0c(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank\n\nrelationship between citizens,politicians,andpolicymakers.For private provision to have acatalytic impact on the sector,information isessential on the performance ofboth thepublic and private sectors.But too little infor-mation has been available on the perfor-mance ofthe public sector and through fewcredible sources.Leveling the playing \ufb01eldbetween public and private providers\u2014asdiscussed later\u2014and benchmarking theirperformance are essential in getting the bestout ofprivate participation in the sector.Overall,the impact ofprivate sector partic-ipation is best leveraged within a broaderreform context\u2014greater separation ofpolicy-makers and providers for all public providers;greater participation ofcommunities in theprocess ofprivate participation and in theregulatory framework;and greater use ofbenchmarking ofboth public and privateproviders.The Australian approach is in-structive.An enabling framework and anational competition law level the playing\ufb01eld for all public and private providers.Sec-toral legislation provides guidelines for serviceprovision.The central government provides\ufb01scal incentives to support change at the statelevel.A variety ofdelivery approaches are sup-ported\u2014corporatization (Melbourne),man-agement contract (Adelaide),vertically inte-grated public utility (Sydney),multi-utility(Canberra).Regulation differs between statesand is backed by independent regulatoryagencies as well as benchmarking donethrough an association ofwater providers.Strengthening client power:charging for servicesUser charges provide operational autonomyfor the provider,support client power,andelicit greater accountability from the state (box9.6).Without access to enough revenues fromthe clients,service providers depend on thepolicymaker for \ufb01scal resources to maintainservice provision.In addition,ifthe seller isnot dependent on the buyer for at least somepart ofrevenues,the provider will have littleincentive to respond to the client.At the sametime,given the politics ofwater pricing,imple-menting user charges can quickly elicit a con-sumer response\u2014as in Johannesburg,Manila,and very visibly in Cochabamba,Bolivia.Implementing user charges.Drawing on thepower ofuser charges to leverage accountabil-ity in service delivery requires,as discussedearlier,effective regulation to address mono-poly provision.But more importantly,the crit-ical policy issue is how to increase tariffs.Thereare two implementation issues:the \ufb01rst is syn-chronizing tariffs with quality improvements,and the second is ensuring that there is a safetynet to safeguard basic affordability.In many countries,bringing the tariffs tocost-recovery levels would require signi\ufb01cantadjustment and rebalancing oftariffs amongresidential,business,and industrial cus-tomers.In Indian cities the charges on resi-dential users are less than a tenth ofthe oper-ating and maintenance costs.Industrial userspay ten times more but are below the bench-mark for operating and maintenance costs intwo-thirds ofthe metropolitan cities and 80percent ofsmaller cities.467Even ifthere is awillingness to charge,how can the transitionto prices be managed?Charging cannot be assessed independentofthe broader policy framework and thecredibility ofservice providers.Policymakersare obviously concerned that services will notimprove enough to justify the price increases.Central to a price increase is what comes\ufb01rst\u2014the increases or service improvement?Guinea entered a lease contract for water ser-vices in its major towns and cities in 1989.During the \ufb01rst six years ofthe contract,thegovernment subsidized a declining share ofthe private operator\u2019s costs while tariffs wereadjusted gradually toward cost recovery,170WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Treating water as an economic good and charg-ing for services enabled France and the Nether-lands to use private provision to jump-start thesector\u2019s development.In France the private sec-tor remains the major service provider of waterand sanitation services.In the Netherlands thesystem shifted from the private to the publicsector.But in both countries charging users forwater remained the norm,which enabledproviders to sustain service delivery at arm\u2019slength from local government and gave themgreater incentives to be responsive to the needsof the clients.Sources:Lorrain (1992);Blokland,Braadbaart,andSchwartz (1999).BOX 9.6Charging forwater\u2014in history19_WDR_Ch09.qxd  8/14/03  10:06 AM  Page 170\x0c(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank\n\nwhich avoided a major tariffshock.Thisjump-started the move to cost recovery andbetter service delivery.It also gave the reformcredibility in a region that had little experi-ence with private provision.468For variousreasons the lease contract expired in 1999 andwas not renewed,but the pricing strategyremains relevant for other countries.Similarly,subsidies to poor people couldbe better targeted and designed,whichwould enable user charges to be imple-mented overall.Chile has a nationallyfunded household water subsidy.Colombiauses geographic targeting.South Africa has anational lifeline tariffsystem that guaranteeseach household 6 kiloliters ofwater amonth.469Given the substantial divergencebetween piped water prices and the high costofthe inferior alternatives that many ofthepoorest are forced to use,there is often astrong case for giving highest priority to con-nection subsidies rather than subsidizing theuse ofwater by those who already enjoyaccess to the piped network.Connectionsubsidies also have the advantage that theyare easier to target (since lacking access toservice is already a strong indicator ofpoverty) and cheaper to administer (sincerelatively large one-time payments areinvolved).Generally it is more ef\ufb01cient tosubsidize the connection costs for low-income households,but there are alternativeoptions for designing connection and con-sumption charges that bene\ufb01t poor people.Ultimately,tariffadjustment and subsidymechanisms are technocratic tools that canbe designed and applied in many ways.Whatis critical is to turn payments for services intoa political tool for reducing patronage andstrengthening client power ofpoor people.Strengthening client power: relyingon independent providersAs the example ofpit operators in Dar-es-Salaam suggests,small independent pro-viders are a common feature in providingwater and sanitation services across incomegroups.Their organization varies fromhousehold vendors ofwater,small networkproviders,and private entrepreneurs to coop-eratives.In some cases they are the primarysuppliers,and in others they supplement theformal provider.In some cases they are partofa competitive market,and in others theyare controlled by a few groups.Enhancing the role ofindependentproviders as part ofthe short route ofaccountability is a key policy challenge.Howcan this be achieved?470By recognizing inde-pendent providers and giving them legal sta-tus,by ensuring that network providers arenot given exclusive supply,by enablinggreater partnership between formal publicand private network providers and smallindependents,by ensuring that the regulatoryframework for network providers gives the\ufb02exibility to enable contracting with inde-pendent providers,by enabling small-scaleprovider associations and working with theseumbrella bodies to introduce appropriatelevels ofregulation,and by enabling poorpeople to gain access to multiple independentproviders while keeping their regulationmore focused on health and issues related togroundwater depletion.Ofparticular concern is the effect ofbringing in a formal private provider in anarea dominated by independent providers.This issue was not addressed in the design ofthe Cochabamba contract\u2014where the pri-vate provider was given exclusivity rights\u2014and it contributed to the contract\u2019s cancella-tion.471In reality,ifcoverage targets arede\ufb01ned in such a way that they can be metwith the services ofsmall independentproviders,the operator will have an incentiveto encourage their involvement.Rural areas:network and non-network systemsRural settings are complex in their settlementpatterns,ranging from dense settlements inSouth Asia to dispersed communities in manyAfrican countries.Suppliers include house-hold systems in Bangladesh,water vendors inLaos,and community-managed local pipedwater systems in Ghana.Across all situations,the client-provider link is the norm.Under-standing why the long route ofaccountabilityis needed to support this client power,andhow this can be done,are the main servicedelivery challenges in rural areas.Community-managed networksIn countries as diverse as India and Kenya,water boards or engineering departmentsDrinking water,sanitation,and electricity17119_WDR_Ch09.qxd  8/14/03  10:07 AM  Page 171\x0c(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank\n\nhave traditionally been responsible fordelivering water services to rural communi-ties.Top-down in their approach,with littleskill in community mobilization,andbacked by \ufb01scal support from central gov-ernment,the boards scaled up physicalinvestment.But they had little success inensuring sustainable operations and main-tenance.Indeed,these boards face the sameproblems ofstate capture inherent in thepatronage model ofservice delivery.Given the failures oftop-down institu-tions,some countries are shifting to com-munity-managed systems\u2014often supportedby donors,as in India and Ghana.Commu-nities are involved in the design and man-agement oftheir water systems,paying foroperations and maintenance costs.Govern-ments,generally central governments,pay asigni\ufb01cant part ofthe capital costs.Donor-funded project management units,backedby not-for-pro\ufb01t organizations,often formthe technical and organizational backboneofthese systems.The client-based model puts the client atthe center ofthe accountability relation-ship,but many challenges remain in scalingit up.472\u2022Communities require technical supportin the medium to long run to managewater systems,and donor-funded pro-ject management units are not wellsuited for this.\u2022Communities pay for current operatingcosts,but replenishing capital invest-ments and covering higher tariffs\u2014topay for rising power costs,for example\u2014are not easily managed through groupcontributions.\u2022Communities are not homogeneous\u2014problems ofexclusion and elite capturecan be the same as in government sys-tems.And different communities mayhave differing abilities to form cohesivegroups.\u2022Ef\ufb01cient technologies that require scaleeconomies are not selected because ofthe focus on village-level associations.Supporting client provisionThree approaches\u2014local governments,re-gional utilities,and independent providers\u2014provide examples ofinstitutional mecha-nisms for supporting community-based sys-tems.They are all \u201cworks in progress,\u201dandlearning from them will offer insights onhow to advance rural community-based sys-tems ofdelivery.Local governments can form the institu-tional and \ufb01nancial support for expandingcommunity-based systems.With access to atax base,local governments can provideresources to cover periodic capital expendi-ture,provide temporary \ufb01scal support tocommunities to adjust to economic shocks,and facilitate access to technical assistance.Uganda and South Africa provide examplesofarrangements in which local govern-ments are part ofa larger \ufb01scal decentral-ization program with own resources andgreater autonomy.Local governments thusstrengthened can support community-based programs.Even in India,where localpanchayatsdo not have as much autonomy,the relations between local governmentsand user groups are evolving.Where neigh-boring small towns have effective providers,these can be contracted in by rural localgovernments to support their communities.In C\xf4te d\u2019Ivoire a national utility run bya private partner has responsibilities forurban centers and smaller towns.Thenational utility uses cross subsidies\u2014withthe capital city providing the \ufb01scal sur-plus\u2014to support the smaller urban centers.Expansion ofits responsibilities to ruralareas is now being tried.The early lessonshave not been successful but the approach isstill evolving.473Finally,communities can contract with athird party or an independent provider tomanage local network systems.In Chinaformal cooperatives (rural companies) runon commercial principles with very highcost recovery.474In several African countriesvillage entrepreneurs manage water systemsunder contract.In East Asia small indepen-dent providers are being organized to takeon operational responsibility on a conces-sion basis.In each case,the process is orga-nized through group consultation andendorsement.While small systems can becontracted by community organizations,villagewide systems may again require thesupport ofpolicymakers at the local level.172WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 200419_WDR_Ch09.qxd  8/14/03  10:07 AM  Page 172\x0c(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank\n\nSelf-provision.Households managing wellsand hand pumps are common in large partsofrural Asia and Africa.Nowhere is self-provision more dramatically showcasedthan in Bangladesh,where shallow aquifersand the market provision ofhand pumpsenabled households to directly managewater services and replace pathogen-conta-minated surface water with groundwater.Service delivery improved\u2014less waitingtime,no quantity limits,and the conve-nience ofhousehold connection.And thehealth impact,which included a decline indiarrhea-related deaths,was remarkable.Missing was any attempt to monitorwater quality.Finding arsenic in thegroundwater caught everyone by surprise.The government had withdrawn from therural water sector,assuming that access wasnow fully addressed by the private marketand household efforts directly.In addition,in a unitary system ofgovernment,therewas no local government to respond to thecrisis.In rural Bangladesh today,a policy-maker is needed to support communities,manage externalities,and understand thetechnological choices for addressing thearsenic crisis (box 9.7).More broadly,for acollective good such as the monitoring ofwater quality,a partnership between clientsand providers will not suf\ufb01ce;policymakersare needed to support communitiesSanitationPolicy issues in sanitation need to be dis-cussed in the context ofthe private and pub-lic goods dimensions ofthe sector.To theextent it is primarily a client-provider rela-tionship,households invest in sanitationsystems and contract independent providersfor the removal ofexcreta.To the extent thepublic goods dimensions are dominant,pol-icymakers need to support collective actionto change behavior at the household andcommunity levels,and organize commoninfrastructure for excreta removal.Access to sanitation services has oftenbeen seen as an issue ofsubsidizing latrinesand prescribing latrine technology.Thissupply-driven approach,emphasizing the\ufb01scal and engineering aspects ofsanitation,has failed.In response,some countries havebeen shifting toward \u201ccomplete sanita-tion\u201d\u2014focusing on community and house-hold behavior and sanitation practices.475This involves breaking the fecal-oral chainby encouraging households to changebehavior\u2014shifting away from open defeca-tion,washing hands,keeping food andwater covered,using safe water,focusing onDrinking water,sanitation,and electricity173The arsenic contamination of shallow aquifersmay be undoing the success of rural drinkingwater provision in Bangladesh.While the num-ber of individuals showing symptoms of arsenicpoisoning is still low\u2014despite the high concen-tration of arsenic in the water\u2014between 25 and30 million people may be at risk in the future.The \ufb01rst response to the crisis bygovernment and many donors was denial.Thiswas followed by an effort to test all watersources and hand pumps.There were varioustechnological and logistical problems\u2014which isnot surprising in view of the fact that arseniccontamination of this scale has not been facedanywhere in the world.These problems werefurther complicated by a lack of coordinationand blurring of roles among government,donors,and nongovernmental organizations(NGOs).The efforts so far have revealed that surfacewater does not contain arsenic and that not allaquifers are contaminated.Government,donors,and NGOs are advocating several options:shift-ing to alternative water sources,including somesurface sources;sharing of uncontaminatedtubewells in villages;sinking deep tubewells inpublic areas;and promoting household \ufb01lteringtechnologies.The latter,if successful,would pre-serve the use of shallow tubewells\u2014decentral-ized,household means of water access\u2014thathave de\ufb01ned the \u201cwater miracle\u201dof Bangladesh.In all of this,little effort was made to understandthe preferences of rural households.A WSP-BRAC (Water and SanitationProgram\u2013Bangladesh Rural Advancement Com-mittee) team undertook a comprehensive sur-vey of household preferences for differentapproaches to arsenic mitigation in selectedareas of rural Bangladesh.The results reveal thatcommunities place a high premium on conve-nience.Unless the alternatives are as convenientas the current hand pumps,the shift to dugwells,well-sharing,and other mechanism maynot work.Indeed they have not yet beensuccessful as solutions.Communities strongly indicated apreference and willingness to pay forcentralized,community-based \ufb01ltering systems,such as local piped-water systems with a central\ufb01ltering point for chemical and biological conta-minants.The piped water network systemsintroduced in the Bogra area by the Rural Devel-opment Academy suggest the potential of suchsystems in Bangladesh.This has been con\ufb01rmedby preliminary data,which show the cost effec-tiveness of piped water in settlements that have300 or more households.If implementedbroadly,this approach would dramaticallychange the nature of water institutions in ruralBangladesh\u2014a change that communities arewilling to undertake.Source:Ahmad and others (2002).BOX 9.7Fighting arsenic by listening to rural communities19_WDR_Ch09.qxd  8/14/03  10:08 AM  Page

ofthis process ofchanging behavior.Because the health impact ofa house-hold\u2019s sanitation practices is affected notonly by the household\u2019s behavior but also bythe practices ofthe community,there is acollective action problem.The provider\u2019srole in ensuring information and social sup-port to households through communitystructures becomes critical.Success dependson making people see themselves as a com-munity,where every member\u2019s behavioraffects the other\u2014a daunting challenge andperhaps the reason why sanitation hasalways lagged behind demand for water.A participatory focus in rural areasBecause communities need to manage sani-tation collectively,innovative participatoryapproaches are required to generatedemand for it,especially in dispersed settle-ments.The shift from open to \ufb01xed-pointdefecation may be motivated by health,safety,and privacy concerns\u2014issues ofimportance to women,who bear much ofthe burden ofpoor sanitation practices.Inthe approach practiced by Village Educa-tion Resource Center (VERC) and Wat-erAid in Bangladesh,an external group trig-gers community-wide recognition oftheneed for better sanitation practices.Thecommunity then takes responsibility forself-regulation\u2014motivating households tostrive for complete sanitation.In East andSouth Asia this has even led to innovationsin latrine technology and micro-credit\ufb01nancing for investments in latrines andassociated infrastructure.Subsidies.The community focus alsochanges the approach to latrine subsidies.InBangladesh,villages in the VERC/WaterAidproject did not require any external subsidy.To assist low-income households,higher-income households provided resources.Once communities focused on the need forcollective responsibility,assisting individualhouseholds to reach community goals wasmore readily accepted.In Vietnam the par-ticipatory approach was supported by a sub-sidy targeted at poorer households.But even ifa subsidy is required,the \ufb01s-cal contribution could be delivered to thecommunity,rewarding collective action,self-regulation,and the elimination ofopen defecation.Take one ofIndia\u2019slargest states\u2014Maharashtra state,with 97million people.It subsidized latrine con-struction by households below the povertyline only to discover that close to 45 per-cent ofthe latrines were not being used.So it shifted its subsidy to a competitivescheme (the Gadge Baba scheme) thatrewarded communities for good sanita-tion practices,using an information cam-paign to de\ufb01ne the principles ofsanitationand publicizing the names ofwinning vil-lages.Reputation,recognition,and com-munity rewards became the catalyst.Overa short period an estimated 100,000household latrines were built,and forevery rupee ofstate resources,localspending on sanitation and related infra-structure increased by 35 rupees.Local compacts.Making the shift to bettersanitation practices is the \ufb01rst objective\u2014but sustaining the shift is equally impor-tant.The local externalities and the need tounderstand and draw on local conditionsand knowledge suggest that local govern-ments are the appropriate policymaker tier.In Vietnam and West Bengal,India,localgovernments have supported communityparticipation and ensured its continuity by\ufb01nancing the work ofthe service provider,usually a not-for-pro\ufb01t organization.InVietnam some local governments have useda program similar to Maharashtra state\u2019sGadge Baba scheme to acknowledge villageand individual achievements.Responding to demand in urban areasHouseholds in urban settlements with highpopulation densities often show a greaterdemand for better sanitation facilities.Thecondominial systems in S\xe3o Paulo,Brazil,and the community sanitation systems ofOrangi in Karachi,Pakistan,and Parivartanin Ahmedabad,India,suggest that informalurban communities may be willing to man-age and pay for ef\ufb01cient systems ofsanitationand waste disposal.Small independent174WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 200419_WDR_Ch09.qxd  8/14/03  10:08 AM  Page 174\x0c(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank\n\nproviders serving households directly,as inDar-es-Salaam,show that urban householdsdo invest in sanitation.So what are theimpediments to expanding these approaches?The answer may lie outside the realm ofwater and sanitation\u2014and in the regulatorydomain ofurban centers.First,the formalrecognition ofinformal communities by gov-ernments and the provision ofsome form oftenure have strongly in\ufb02uenced communitywillingness to invest in household infrastruc-ture and to work collectively on communityinfrastructure (La Paz in Bolivia,Ahmedabadin India).Research on garbage collection ininformal settlements in Indonesia providesempirical evidence ofthe negative relation-ship between incomplete property rights andcommunity investment in local publicgoods.476It suggests that improving tenuresecurity increases the probability ofgarbagecollection by 32\u201344 percent.Second,in dense urban areas the munici-pal government\u2019s willingness to allocate somepublic land to sanitation systems has enabledcommunities to develop community facili-ties,contracting them with a third party tomaintain and operate them (Pune in India).Use is restricted to the community through amonthly charge collected by the communityand paid to the operator.Third,municipal laws need to support\ufb02exible standards and ensure that communi-ties and households can make arrangementswith independent providers.Laws that per-mit exclusive service provision need to bereplaced by laws that permit differentapproaches and standards.A concluding caveat is,however,neces-sary on the discussion about sanitation.His-torical evidence suggests that demand forwater and sanitation follows a sequencing\u2014water \ufb01rst,followed by sanitation and thendemand for waste water treatment.Experi-ence also suggests that this sequencing isin\ufb02uenced by many factors ofwhich servicedelivery arrangements in the sector is onlyone.In this context,policymakers mustremain realistic and patient about how farthey can catalyze the demand for sanitationthrough external interventions.Unless em-bedded in a demand-responsive approach,throwing subsidies at latrines will not resolvethe challenge ofscaling up sanitation.ElectricityLike water,electricity has urban and ruralcomponents\u2014and issues ofmanaging gridand off-grid systems.In the grid setting,theissues ofseparating the policymaker fromthe provider,charging for services,usingprivate providers,and developing effectiveregulatory systems are similar to water net-work issues (box 9.8).477A key difference isunbundling (rather than decentralizing)services.For electricity in rural settings,theextension ofthe grid network provideslessons for managing non-network systemsin water.And the emerging use ofoff-gridelectricity systems can draw on lessons fromcommunity-managed water in rural set-tings.Grid systems.The experience from LatinAmerica,Eastern Europe,and South Asiasuggests that unbundling the electricitychain into generation,transmission,andDrinking water,sanitation,and electricity175Unlike water and sanitation coverage,electricity coverage has increased signi\ufb01cantly over thepast decade.But like water and sanitation,electricity faces daunting challenges in South Asiaand Africa and rural areas across most regions in the world.And as in the case of water andsanitation,increased electricity coverage does not automatically imply ef\ufb01cient service deliv-ery.The problems of theft,intermittent supply,shared access\u2014captured broadly under theheading of electricity losses\u2014make wires no different from pipes in the context of creatingaccountability in service delivery.Source:International Energy Agency (2002).BOX 9.8Are pipes and

International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank\n\ndistribution components is critical toreforms in the sector\u2014but only ifthe marketis large enough to support multiple electricitygenerators,and hence genuine competi-tion.478Unbundling provides scope for com-petition in the relevant sectors,primarilygeneration.Separating the components alsocreates scope for getting better informationabout the cost structure ofeach part ofthechain.The competition and the informationadd to client power.But transmission and distribution func-tions are monopolies,and without effectiveregulation it may be dif\ufb01cult to ensure theseparation ofpolicymaker and provider,andeven reduce the scope to introduce competi-tion in generation.Unless distribution istransferred to different types ofownership,anational or regional government as a soleowner will not have much incentive to sepa-rate its policymaking responsibilities from theoperations ofthe distribution system.Privatizing distribution is a common pol-icy approach,but decentralizing electricityassets to local governments is not generallyconsidered.Even where local governmentsown distribution systems\u2014as in SouthAfrica\u2014the policy discussion is about con-solidating into regional distribution systems.This is driven by economies ofscale andscope,and perhaps also by policy decisions tocross-subsidize from urban to rural settingsand to keep the cross subsidy in the sector.Interestingly,in Mumbai and Kolkata,India,where electricity is under local governments,electricity provision has long been under pri-vate operation.Even in Delhi\u2014in effect acity-state\u2014power distribution is now pri-vate.Rural grid.The extension ofthe grid intorural areas offer insights for rural water andoff-grid electricity with regard to reestablish-ing the relationship between policymakerand service providers.A model ofruralcooperatives has emerged in the UnitedStates and is being adapted in Bangladeshand the Philippines.A regional or nationalprovider organization contracts with com-munity cooperatives to be village-level dis-tributors.In Bangladesh the Rural ElectricityBoard (REB) supports the village coopera-tives through technical assistance and \ufb01scaltransfers for a part ofthe capital costs.Thiswould be similar to using regional water util-ities to support community-managed watersystems.Importantly,the owner ofthe distri-bution is not the policymaker but the clients.Unbundling the national REB into regionalREBs,with some form ofbenchmarking,could support the clients in breaking a possi-ble monopolistic relationship between theREB and the cooperatives.Rural off-grid.Rural provider organiza-tions\u2014or local governments\u2014can also sup-port off-grid systems in villages,in manycases using renewable energy to generatepower.Donors have traditionally advocatedsolar household systems\u2014not unlike thetechnology push in latrines.But today\u2019srenewable systems can support villagewidegrids\u2014similar to villagewide piped water sys-tems\u2014to provide AC electricity for house-hold appliances ofvarious types.Dependingon local conditions the systems can also bewind-powered,solar,tidal,bio-gas,or hybrid,with fossil-fueled generators as backup.Moving the reform agendaforwardIndia is revolting and the Thames stinks.Slogan in London,1857The result: Chadwick and the sanitary revolution in the United Kingdom.479Given the weak voice relationship betweencitizens and politicians in the water,sanita-tion,and electricity sectors,deep institutionalreform often comes from broader stresses inthe economic,political,and institutionalmachinery ofa country.In London pollutionwas such a cause.In Johannesburg the city\u2019sbankruptcy was the impetus.In cities inAfrica and Latin America a core impulse forreform ofurban water and sanitation is thecombination ofsector problems and amacroeconomic crisis.480Society\u2019s view ofeconomic development isalso important.In Australia,Chile,and Peru,growth-driven economic development strat-egy provided the impetus for improving theperformance ofwater and power markets.Sothe possibilities for sector reform seem great-est when there is a con\ufb02uence ofnatural chal-lenge,\ufb01scal crisis,and institutional reform-176WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT

chance,when broaderchanges in turn catalyze sectoral reforms.What are the potential interim measures?", u"['SDG_1', 'SDG_3', 'SDG_6', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_9', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_16']Canincremental change be strategic?For urban networks,change will requireseparating the delivery functions from thoseofbenchmarking and regulation.Keepingthe latter with an upper-tier government\u2014central or regional\u2014while dispersing own-ership ofwater and sanitation assets tolower-tier governments and the private sec-tor could create this separation.Withoutownership responsibilities,the upper-tierpolicymaker would have greater incentivesto use \ufb01scal instruments,benchmarking,and regulation to promote improvements inservice provision.Such incentives are lessinherent in a model where the regulator,provider,and owner are one and the same.Charging users for services strengthens thisseparation by directly involving clients inthe service chain through the short route ofaccountability.Where the introduction ofprivate sectorparticipation is tempered by politics or otherfactors,strategic change may have to come\ufb01rst through changes in ownership and rela-tionships ofaccountability between tiers ofthe public sector.Interestingly,the history ofsome industrialized countries suggests thatlocal ownership can trigger a more crediblepath to private sector participation,especiallyiflocal governments are effective in strength-ening voice.Where local governments exist and waterand sanitation services have been devolved tolocal governments,the challenge ofimprovedservice delivery would lie in making decen-tralization work.Where local governmentsdo not exist,the lever ofdecentralized owner-ship would be lost,but benchmarking andregulation ofthe public sector would remain.But for such a strategy to be effective,charg-ing for water would become even more criti-cal.It would enable providers to achievesome independence in operations,but moreimportantly it would give clients a role in sus-taining the separation and ensuring that theregulation ofpublic providers is effective.Inthis context,introducing private players in afew ofthe utilities would enhance the effec-tiveness ofbenchmarking the publicproviders.Where this broader approach ofmakingservices work for all is not possible,a targetedapproach for serving poor people using smallindependent providers is still an option.Indeed,increasingly independent providersmay,at the margin,emerge as a critical leverfor making services work for poor people.For rural systems\u2014community-managedsystems and self-provision\u2014the challenge isto seek mechanisms for the policymaker tosupport client power,using local govern-ments,regional utilities,and independentproviders.This is similar to the model oftherural electricity cooperatives supported by aprovider organization that provides a techni-cal and \ufb01scal hub.Where local governmentsprovide this hub,the voice channel is direct;where utilities are the support mechanism,the voice channel is indirect.Where theseoptions are not possible,the approach\u2014however unsatisfactory\u2014oftargeted com-munity projects remains.For sanitation,the focus is on collectiveaction\u2014to change behavior and mobilizecommunities to invest in community infra-structure.To support this,compacts betweenpolicymakers and NGOs may be moreappropriate.In urban areas,where greaterdemand for sanitation services may exist,policymakers can support client power byallowing independent providers to functionand by supporting tenure in informal settle-ments.A more incremental version would besimilar to that in the rural water sector\u2014witha public provider organization supportingNGO delivery in targeted areas.But ifthe failure ofvoice is why infra-structure services have failed poor people,targeted intervention cannot form the basisofinstitutional reform.Reforming the rela-tionships ofaccountability would remain thepolicy challenge.Drinking water,sanitation,and electricity17719_WDR_Ch09.qxd  8/14/03  10:10 AM  Page 177\x0c(c) The International Bank for

workloads asdespairing of\ufb01cials began to drift away.Andthey began to explore public-private part-nerships.The city of gold\u2014iGoli 2002The new city management team realizedthat Johannesburg needed a new system ofaccountability for service delivery within adramatically different institutional archi-tecture.To address fragmentation and thesevere moral hazard,the city had to bereuni\ufb01ed.Political debate focused on twomodels ofmetropolitan coordination:\u2022De\ufb01ning more clearly the rules ofbud-geting,\ufb01scal transfers,and service deliv-ery between the metropolitan andmunicipal tiers,strengthening both.\u2022Creating a one-tier metropolitan gov-ernment.484Johannesburg chose a hybrid.It central-ized political authority,treasury manage-ment,and spatial planning under one met-ropolitan government.But it organizedservice delivery through decentralizedstructures.This meant merging \ufb01ve sepa-rate councils into one overarching munici-pality,creating integrated service deliverystructures with new incentives.Accountability in service deliveryUnder one metropolitan council,iGoli 2002split the institution for policy formulationand regulation from the institutions forimplementation.On one side,a core admin-istration remained responsible for strategicplanning,contract administration,and suchcorporate services as \ufb01nance,planning,andcommunication.On the other,two sets ofoperating entities were established:11 newregional administrations for libraries,health,recreation,and other communityservices;and \ufb01nancially ring-fenced,semi-By most developing world standardsJohannesburg is not a poor city.Butit faces serious development andservice delivery challenges.Apartheid madesure that exclusive white suburbs were wellserviced,forcing black residents intosprawling underdeveloped slums.Poverty,unemployment,and homelessness are allworsened by the deeper problem ofinequality.The Johannesburg Metropolitan Munici-pality was democratically elected in 1995 toaddress the service imbalances.It quicklyfound itselfin a \ufb01scal and institutional crisis.Johannesburg was not one institutionbut \ufb01ve,with an overarching MetropolitanCouncil and four primary-level councils.Each could decide its priorities and approveits budget.But responsibilities for key ser-vices were split between the two levels,andthe operating budgets ofthe councils had tobalance only in aggregate.That meant eachcouncil could blissfully spend on theassumption that its shortfalls would be off-set by surpluses in another.The arrangement was a recipe for disas-ter.Each municipality went on a spendingspree,and ambitious infrastructure planswere rolled out without the \ufb01nance.Deteri-orating revenues\u2014due to a service-paymentboycott culture left over from anti-apartheid struggles,poverty,and poor creditcontrol\u2014made the situation worse.The citywas forced to delve into its reserves,butthese could go

cutbacks followed.Blaming of\ufb01cials for the crisis,politicianstook a much tighter rein over day-to-daydecisions,ending management discretion.independent,single-purpose entities tooverhaul larger

waste manage-ment.\u2022Two agencies were established\u2014forparks and cemeteries,and for roads andstorm water\u2014where expenditure wouldstill have to be covered by tax revenue.\u2022Smaller corporatized units were set upfor facilities like the zoo and the civictheater.All were established as new companies,with the council as sole shareholder.Two key units would guide and overseethe new entities:a corporate planningunit to do citywide strategic planning,anda contract management unit to regulatethe operating utilities through a range ofnew instruments,including licensingagreements and annual service levelagreements.One size does not \ufb01t allSince the operating entities are not boundby overarching administrative rules,theyhave scope to differentiate.Each could setup different

beenstrengthened because the primary mecha-nism is no longer the impossible-to-digestcommittee report on everyday operationalmatters.Now councilors focus on strategicoversight,and of\ufb01cials are responsible foroutcomes clearly de\ufb01ned in service-levelagreements.Reporting goes through struc-tured channels,either to the contract man-agement unit or to company boards ofdirectors,which include external specialistscapable ofprobing service results.The operating entities have also set upuser forums allowing communities to com-municate needs,raise complaints,and evenparticipate actively in service provision.Of\ufb01cials are much more sensitive to ever-changing service delivery challenges.These management improvements arealready translating into better service

education,health,andinfrastructure to work for poor people,gov-ernments have to be involved.Whether theyful\ufb01ll this responsibility by providing,\ufb01nancing,regulating,or monitoring ser-vices or providing information about them,the basic functioning ofgovernment shouldunderpin,not undermine,effective services.When governments do not run well,theycannot sustain the institutional arrangementsand accountability relationships that yieldgood services.Looking at all that govern-ments do,the biggest payoffs to service deliv-ery are likely to come from a few key actions:spending wisely and predictably in line withpriorities and coordinated across sectors;managing decentralization to reap the bene-\ufb01ts ofbeing closer to the client;developingand deploying administrative capacity to takesound decisions at the top and to implementthem well;curtailing corruption;and learn-ing from success and failure.Public sector reforms take time andskillful political navigation.Agreeing ondesirable goals is easy.Managing the tran-sition is hard.When starting capacities arelow,the road to improved performancemay need to be covered in small steps\u2014what this Report calls strategic incremen-talism.Reforming basic incentives thatstrengthen accountability and raise per-formance closer to formal standards is theplace to start.As incentives become betteraligned and internalized and as adminis-trative capacity grows,more advancedreforms can be deployed to supportdeeper institutional change and scalingup.Throughout this process reformsshould be guided by the lessons ofsuccessand failure.Strengthening the foundationsof governmentGovernments are essential to making basicservices work for poor people,but a govern-ment village school does not ensure thatchildren learn,or a maternity clinic thatmothers can give birth safely.Both needtimely budget transfers,reliable electricity,aconnecting road,probity in procurement,and competent public servants.To sustainservices that work,broader structures at thefoundation ofgovernment must also work.Whether providing,\ufb01nancing,regulating,or monitoring services,governments focusedon outcomes for poor people muststrengthen the compact relationship betweenpolicymakers and providers along the longroute ofaccountability.486For basic servicesin education,health,and infrastructure,poli-cymakers must deal with multiple compactrelationships with providers across sectors,space,and time (\ufb01gure 10.1).Just as anensemble makes great music when it is wellcoordinated and not because it has a few vir-tuoso musicians,strengthening the longroute is easier when the generalbusiness ofgovernment runs well across the entire gamutofgovernment activities,and not just in a fewPublic sector

ofgovernment,the stronger thefoundations for service reforms.In managing the cross-cutting activitiesofgovernments,the three institutionalstructures likely to in\ufb02uence service deliv-ery the most are budgets,decentralization,and public administration.These are cru-cial tasks for a government that wants tomake services work for people:makingbudget allocations and implementing them;organizing and monitoring the tiers ofgov-ernment that provide,\ufb01nance,regulate,ormonitor services;and managing publicemployees involved in service delivery.Spending wiselyWhen services fail poor people,a good placeto start looking for the underlying problemis almost always how the government spendsmoney.Ifpoliticians and policymakersspend more than they can sustain,servicesdeteriorate.Ifbudgets are misallocated,basicservices remain underfunded and frontlineproviders are handicapped.And iffunds aremisappropriated,service quality,quantity,and access suffer.The budget is the criticallink on the long route ofaccountabilitycon-necting citizens to providers through politi-cians and policymakers.Public expenditure management\u2014for-mulating,implementing,and reportingannual budgets\u2014is a challenging task,par-ticularly when capacities are limited and thelong route ofaccountability is weak.Chap-ter 5 discusses how citizen budget initiativescan increase voice.This chapter discusseshow politicians and policymakers canstrengthen the compact using public expen-diture management to systematicallyachieve three desirable outcomes that canunderpin effective services:aggregate \ufb01scaldiscipline,allocative ef\ufb01ciency and equity,and operational impact.487Aggregate \ufb01scal disciplineWith no effective mechanism for resolvingthe competing budget claims ofpoliticians,line ministries,and subnational govern-ments,public expenditures will exceedavailable funds.The resulting unsustainable\ufb01scal de\ufb01cits can translate into high in\ufb02a-tion,high interest rates,and burgeoningcurrent account de\ufb01cits.Despite the simplelogic ofthis argument\u2014and sometimesdriven by external shocks\u2014countries slipinto macroeconomic crises that inevitablylead to belt-tightening.Countries in crisismay have no option but to curtail basic ser-vices,even ifthe service delivery chain nor-mally works well.Argentina is just the mostrecent example (box 10.1).Countries can instill \ufb01scal discipline bystrengthening budget formulation by the\ufb01nance ministry.Constitutional or legisla-tive restraints can rein in legislatures andministries.Brazil and Chile have laws on \ufb01s-cal responsibility that limit budget de\ufb01cits.In Colombia,Peru,the Philippines,andUruguay the constitution constrains or pro-hibits amendments to increase budgets.Sound public expenditure managementrequires reliable revenue projections andcomprehensive budgets that do not hideguarantees and other contingent liabilities.When budgets are not comprehensive,theconsequences can be harsh,as Thailandfound in 1997 when contingent liabilitiesfrom the banking and \ufb01nance sectors blind-sided the government and triggered aregionwide \ufb01nancial crisis.Allocative ef\ufb01ciency and equityFor basic services in education,health,andinfrastructure to work for poor people,gov-ernments have to be involved,as chapter 2After three years of recession,the economicand \ufb01nancial crisis in Argentina came to ahead at the end of 2001.The social impact ofthe crisis has been devastating.Poverty rateshave jumped 40 percent.There is growingevidence of deterioration in service quality,access,and use of social services.Roughly 12percent of people with formal health insur-ance discontinued or reduced their cover-age,increasing the burden on alreadystrapped public hospitals,the traditionalprovider for the uninsured.Dif\ufb01culties withfederal transfers have led to serious short-ages in medical supplies throughout thepublic hospital network.The pressure formaintaining funding for high-cost curativecare has further cut into the already lowresources allocated to primary care.Mater-nal and child health is likely to be at risk.Epi-demiological surveillance data report anincrease in some endemic diseases.Education has been similarly hit,withsalary delays and work stoppages in severalprovinces.During 2002 roughly a third ofprovinces experienced school closings of20\u201380 days over a school year of 180 days.Many provinces were forced to concentratetheir falling resources on wages,sharplyreducing \ufb01nancing for school lunches,infra-structure,and other investments.Source:World Bank staff.BOX 10.1The impact ofArgentina\u2019s crisis on health andeducation services21_WDR_Ch10.qxd  8/14/03  10:14 AM  Page

about service delivery remains thesame,there is little reason to expect positivechange.The assumption is that decentral-ization works by enhancing citizens\u2019voicein a way that leads to improved services.Buton both theoretical and empirical groundsthis could go either way.The crucial ques-tion always is whether decentralizationincreases accountability relative to its alter-natives.Iflocal governments are no morevulnerable to capture than the center is,decentralization is likely to improve bothef\ufb01ciency and equity.500The impact ofdecentralization on ser-vices is further complicated when,as is usu-ally the case,political,\ufb01scal,and administra-tive goals are not followed simultaneously orin a supportive sequence.Decentralizationin eight Latin American countries suggeststhat political objectives were often the trig-ger,but paths diverged thereafter (box 10.4).Only some countries moved on to \ufb01scal andadministrative decentralization as primaryobjectives.Such variation,inevitable ascountries adapt,makes it hard to predict thecourse ofdecentralization and to measureits costs and bene\ufb01ts.501Given its manypaths,the record ofservice improvements ismixed\u2014including some notable successes(decentralizing education in Central Amer-ica,devolution in Bolivia,municipalreforms in South Africa),some reversals (inthe Russian Federation and parts ofLatinAmerica),and some cases too new to assess(initiatives in Indonesia and Pakistan).502Decentralization and accountability for servicesDecentralization must reach the clinic,theclassroom,and local water and electricity util-ities in ways that create opportunities forstrengthening accountability between citi-zens,politicians/policymakers,and providers.Depending on its degree\u2014deconcentration,delegation,and devolution\u2014and its imple-mentation,decentralization offers opportuni-ties for strengthening different parts oftheDecentralization in Latin America shows how objec-tives changed over time in each country and shapedoutcomes and the path of decentralization.Wheredecentralization was driven mainly by politicalobjectives (as in Ecuador,Peru,and Venezuela),thetransfer of resources was often signi\ufb01cant,but thetransfer of responsibilities was more dif\ufb01cult to pur-sue.Where political decentralization was joined anddriven by sophisticated but misaligned regional \ufb01s-cal autonomy (as in Argentina and Brazil),cyclicaleconomic and political crises erupted because of theinability of the center to impose \ufb01scal discipline onsubnational governments.In Colombia,thoughdecentralization was initially driven by politicalmotives,\ufb01scal and administrative adjustments randeeper,and cyclical adjustments in the \ufb01scal andadministrative systems were common.This experience in Latin America shows that thetransfer of political,\ufb01scal,and administrative powerdoes not necessarily occur simultaneously or in asupportive sequence.In fact,only in Bolivia\u2019s reformeffort in 1994 were these powers transferredtogether.Chile democratized in 1990,introducedpopular participation but not regional elections anddevolution,and in the mid-1990s further deepenedthe administrative delegation that had marked itsearlier military regime.Of these countries Chile maynow be best placed to attempt deeper administra-tive and political devolution because of the growthof local capacity and the absence of the regional \ufb01s-cal crises that struck many of its neighbors on theirroad to decentralization.Source:Frank,Starnfeld,and Zimmerman (2003).BOX 10.4Many roads to decentralization: Latin AmericaIn Ethiopia decentralization has been aresponse to pressures from regional and eth-nic groups for greater political participation.When the Ethiopian People\u2019s RevolutionaryDemocratic Front (EPRDF) defeated theMengistu dictatorship in 1991,the new gov-ernment faced a complex political landscape.Ethnicity was extremely politicized,and thestruggle against Mengistu had been spear-headed by organizations promoting ethnicnationalism in Ethiopia\u2019s diverse population.The single-party EPRDF government neededto establish control over the entire country,legitimize its authority,and include othergroups in the political system.The 1994 constitution transformedEthiopia into an ethnicity-based federationand decentralized administrative responsi-bilities to nine regions.The accompanyingeducation reforms were laid out in the \u201cEdu-cation and Training Policy of 1994.\u201dRegionswere given responsibility for planning,designing,implementing,and monitoringthe primary education curriculum andteacher training.The syllabus remained cen-trally controlled,with input from theregions.Previously,Amharic had been thesole language of instruction,but the newpolicy gave all children the right to receiveprimary education in their mother tongue.At least 18 languages are now being usedas the medium of instruction,althoughAmharic remains the national language.Politically motivated decentralizationcarries implications that are critical for theimpact of reform.The education policiesadopted along with political decentraliza-tion may well be good ideas for improvingthe quality of instruction and learning.But ifimproving quality is not a central objectiveof decentralizing Ethiopian education,theresulting lack of commitment to ensuringthat outcome could become the most dif\ufb01-cult obstacle to overcome.Source:Pritchett and Farooqui (2003).BOX

providers and may have littlein\ufb02uence on local voice.At the other end,devolutionimplies the handing over ofgreaterpower and resources to local politicians andtherefore greater scope for strengthening localvoice,their compact with local providers,andlocal client power.Delegation falls in between.The degree ofdecentralization thus impactsdifferently on the short and long routes ofaccountability (table 10.2).In practice,decen-tralization inevitably involves a mix ofdecon-centration,delegation,and devolution.Particularly when local taxing and spend-ing powers and central \ufb01nancing are wellmatched,decentralization can create checksand balances that can motivate both centraland subnational governments to make localservices work.But accountability may notimprove,and the potential gains ofdecentral-ization may be lost,ifthe \ufb01scal and otherincentives underlying the center-subnationalrelationship are misaligned so that checks andbalances do not work.A study ofthe transferofresponsibility for secondary schools toprovinces in Argentina in 1994\u201398 found thatwhile average test scores improved,the gainswere much lower when schools were trans-ferred to severely mismanaged provinces (asmeasured by provincial \ufb01scal de\ufb01cits).503To allow decentralization to reach localclassrooms,clinics,hospitals,and publicworks departments in a way that increasesaccountability and makes services work bet-ter,three areas are key:subnational \ufb01nance,the division ofadministrative responsibilitiesbetween center and subnational govern-ments,and local capacity.Getting \ufb01scal incentives rightA subnational government will have weakerincentives to deliver cost-effective services thatmeet minimum standards ifit can manipulatefunding (from the center or from market bor-rowing) to shift its liabilities to the center(called a soft budget constraint).504Subna-tional liabilities can be contractual,\ufb01scalde\ufb01cits,or public goods that are underpro-vided.A soft budget constraint weakensaccountability,creates moral hazard,andthreatens macroeconomic stability by creatingcontingent liabilities for the center that it may\ufb01nd hard to refuse to pay.Underdevelopedcapital markets and elections that do notpenalize local politicians for cost and de\ufb01citshifting are part ofthe problem.A hard budgetconstraint strengthens accountability butrequires a sound intergovernmental \ufb01scal sys-tem.The center,having devolved responsibil-ity and resources,is prodded by a hard budgetconstraint to support effective subnationalmanagement and service delivery,therebyavoiding \ufb01scal problems and unhappy citizens.Getting the intergovernmental \ufb01scal systemright.Standard welfare economics suggeststhe ef\ufb01ciency and equity grounds for assign-ing expenditure responsibilities,revenues,and grants to lower tiers ofgovernment.505Service decisions and expenditures should be21_WDR_Ch10.qxd  8/14/03  10:17 AM  Page 188\x0c(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank\n\nPublic sector underpinnings ofservice reform189devolved to the lowest tier ofgovernmentthat can internalize the costs and bene\ufb01ts ofthe service\u2014the so-called subsidiarity princi-ple.The principle suggests that subnationalgovernments should administer basic healthand education services.But setting minimumstandards (for quantity,quality,and access)and \ufb01nancing minimum access should becentral responsibilities on grounds ofinter-jurisdictional equity.In practice,things getmore complicated.Expenditures are oftennot assigned carefully to subnational govern-ments.506Central governments delay trans-fers.Shared expenditure responsibilities arethe trickiest to handle and can lead to free-rider problems and de\ufb01cit- and cost-shiftingbehavior that softens the budget constraint.To increase responsiveness to local citi-zens,subnational governments need a localtax instrument and the freedom to set rates.Also important are simple,transparent,for-mula-based transfers from the center thatare predictable over several years.Ifmadecontingent on service outputs,lump-sumgrants can ensure a minimum level ofser-vice delivery for poor people,equalize \ufb01scalcapacity across jurisdictions,and create per-formance incentives.Ideally,expenditures,revenue assignments,and transfers shouldbe designed jointly so that once they are set,any additional expenditure demands couldbe met through taxes rather than grants.507The more these principles are violated,thegreater the informality around transfers,and the lower their predictability and stabil-ity,the softer the budget constraint gets.508Getting subnational borrowing right.Cap-ital markets,where suf\ufb01ciently developed,can bolster subnational accountability.Table 10.2Decentralization is never simpleKey political, \ufb01scal, and administrative features of decentralization and

The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank\n\nWhere markets are underdeveloped and mar-ket discipline is weak,a prior question iswhether subnational governments shouldborrow at all.Effective \ufb01scal decentralizationshould certainly precede \ufb01nancial decentral-ization to avoid giving the signal that the cen-ter is underwriting subnational debts.509Allowing subnational borrowing from public\ufb01nancial institutions can unintentionally sendthis signal.In Argentina,Brazil,India,andUkraine,specialized development banks andinstitutions have provided a backdoor routeto central subsidies when transfers wouldhave been simpler and more transparent.Getting subnational regulation right.Governments \ufb01nd it hard not to bail outlower-tier governments when \ufb01nancialpro\ufb02igacy threatens basic services,risksspreading to other jurisdictions,or threat-ens monetary policy or the country\u2019s creditrating.This has led to the imposition oftop-down regulation,either administrativecontrols or rule-based debt restrictions thatmimic the market.Regulation,because it isvulnerable to political bargaining,usuallyneeds to be supplemented by checks andbalances on the center itselfso that itsstance remains credible.In South Africathese are provided by the constitution,theconstitutional court,and international cap-ital markets.510Subnational bankruptcyarrangements can help.A control board(that can be invoked only by an indepen-dent court) to \ufb01nance minimum,nationallyset service levels can protect the center fromhaving to step in.Where bailouts areunavoidable,the center can use the oppor-tunity to make regulation more effective.Acomprehensive \ufb01scal monitoring and evalu-ation system that works consistently acrossjurisdictions can help greatly in implement-ing no-bailout and regulation strategies.Getting administrativeresponsibilities rightPolitical and \ufb01scal considerations gener-ally claim far greater attention thanadministrative decentralization does.511Inmany instances decentralization has pro-ceeded without explicit staf\ufb01ng strategies,and a central civil service typically coexistswith subnational and local governments.Though the 1992 landmark amendmentsto the Indian constitution require eachstate to create urban and rural local gov-ernments and assign functions and rev-enues,virtually all staffat the local levelremain state employees.In contrast,Indonesia recently adopted a \u201cbig-bang\u201dapproach,moving quickly to transferroughly 2.1 million civil servants to sub-national district governments.512Uganda,in shifting from deconcentration to devo-lution in the 1990s,established districtservice commissions with the authority tohire and \ufb01re personnel\u2014though in prac-tice central policy and administrativerules have tightly controlled the process sothat it has resembled delegation morethan devolution.That may change as localcapacities grow.Pakistan\u2019s recent three-tier devolution envisages the creation ofdistrict and subdistrict cadres:districthealth and education cadres have beencreated in some provinces,but adminis-trative decentralization still has a long wayto go.National pay scales,rigid collective bar-gaining agreements,and disagreements withnational labor unions can severely circum-scribe the \ufb02exibility that subnational gov-ernments have in rationalizing employment,as seen in many Asian,African,and LatinAmerican countries.513Centralized labornegotiations and bargaining agreements canact as unfunded mandates that undo \ufb01scaldecentralization (as in South Africa).Engag-ing public sector workers and unions in dis-cussions about different aspects ofdecen-tralization can increase local \ufb02exibility andimprove provider compacts.At the sametime,administrative devolution needs tostrike a balance between autonomy and uni-formity to allow for desirable features suchas interjurisdictional mobility for highlyskilled staffin short supply.It is importantto align the structure ofthe civil service withthe assignment ofservice responsibilities todifferent tiers\u2014misalignment confusesincentives,weakens accountability,and cre-ates con\ufb02icts ofinterest instead ofchecksand balances.In practice this is not easy,andit takes time.The twin tasks ofdevolving administra-tion and building local capacity can be190WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 200421_WDR_Ch10.qxd  8/14/03  10:18 AM  Page 190\x0c(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank\n\nPublic sector underpinnings ofservice reform191daunting even under ideal conditions ofbudget and stakeholder support.Whenbudgets are constrained and support ismixed,public administration reform isinevitably drawn out,falling behind politi-cal and \ufb01scal decentralization.So the earlierthe start in building local capacities,thesmoother the process ofdecentralization islikely to be.Building local capacity withautonomyDecentralize or build local capacity:which\ufb01rst?", u"['SDG_1', 'SDG_3', 'SDG_4', 'SDG_6', 'SDG_7', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_9', 'SDG_11']Simplifying donor policies,procedures,and practices and directing aid \ufb02exiblythrough sectorwide approaches or the bud-get process would lower the high transac-tion costs in low-income countries andallow recipients to pursue their objectivesmore ef\ufb01ciently.That could be done ifdonors were driven solely by the motive toreduce poverty\u2014and ifrecipients were per-ceived to be committed to the same goal.But the world is more complex.Incentivesin aid agencies and the political economy ofaid in donor countries work against this:\u2022Aid agencies want to be able to identifytheir own contributions,often throughdistinct \u201cprojects,\u201dto facilitate feedbackto taxpayers and sustain political sup-port for aid \ufb02ows.A new hospital is eas-ier to showcase than the outcome ofpol-icy reform or budget support.\u2022Aid agencies,facing disbursement pres-sures,need to show quick results to tax-payers\u2014and NGOs,to their contribu-tors.This is easier when donors are incharge ofinterventions.\u2022Politicians and policymakers in donorcountries cannot dismiss the interestgroups that support them,groups thatmay place a high priority on funding like-minded groups in developing countries.\u2022Many donors limit the market for aidservices and supplies to their ownnationals (tied aid).Foreign aid sustainsa large consultancy industry in OECDcountries\u2014estimated at $4 billion a yearfor Sub-Saharan Africa,or 30 percent ofaid to the continent.216WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004To improve access to infrastructure services forpoor people,several donors have pooled fundsto augment and disseminate knowledge oninfrastructure services.These facilities,adminis-tered by the World Bank,provide a source ofknowledge and advice that is \u201c\ufb01re-walled\u201dfromthe Bank\u2019s lending activities.Donors in the poolare Canada,Japan,the Netherlands,Sweden,Switzerland,the United Kingdom,and theUnited Nations Development

8/14/03  10:37 AM  Page 216\x0c(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank\n\nDonors and service reform217\u2022Preferences for spending differ amongdonors and between donors and recipi-ents.Donors often are most comfortablewith service delivery systems ofthe typeoperating in their own country.Forinstance,British and Nordic advisers arefamiliar with a clinic-based free healthservice and so prefer to support thosesystems in low-income countries too.\u2022Fiduciary concerns and incentives in aidagencies cause donors to focus on moni-toring inputs and processes.Again,themonitoring is easier in project aid wherethe donor controls the design and imple-mentation ofeach intervention.\u2022Donors may want to persuade aid recipi-ents ofthe value ofa different approachthrough a pilot project,to show success.\u2022Bilateral donors distribute their aid bud-gets across a large number ofrecipientsand sectors,to increase the visibility oftheir programs or to leverage or rewarddiplomatic support from recipientnations.588More specialization amongsectors or recipients,however ef\ufb01cient,could expose a donor to charges that it isneglecting,say,a global health crisis or aregional humanitarian crisis.Such con-siderations help explain why the typicalbilateral donor in 2000 provided of\ufb01cialdevelopment aid (ODA) to about 115independent nations.Even omittingrecipients that received less than$100,000,the mean number ofODArecipients for each ofthe 22 major bilat-eral donors was 95.These multiple objectives create incen-tives for donors to \ufb01nance and directly con-trol their aid interventions.That createsproblems for recipient countries:donorsoften do not know (or don\u2019t care) whatother donors and the recipient are doing,which results in duplication,waste,andgaps in services.589These days donors tendto favor social sector projects over otherpublic expenditures.Ifthey do not payattention to what the others are doing,theymay concentrate too much on higher-prior-ity sectors,leaving sectors with a lower pri-ority,such as rural roads in Zambia,shortoffunds.Or there may be gaps in the prior-ity areas simply because nobody is lookingat the big picture.But priorities amongdonors vary,and their approaches changeover time.590So there is some scope\u2014andhope\u2014for improvement.23_WDR_Ch11.qxd  8/14/03

capitais PPP GNI divided by midyear pop-ulation.Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita growth isbased on GDP measured in constant prices.GDP is the sumofvalue added by all resident producers plus any producttaxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation ofoutput.Growth in GDP is considered a broad measure ofgrowth ofan economy.GDP in constant prices can be estimated bymeasuring the total quantity ofgoods and services producedin a period,valuing them at an agreed set ofbase year prices,and subtracting the cost ofintermediate inputs,also in con-stant prices.Growth is calculated from constant price GDPdata in local currency.Table 2.Millennium Development Goals:eradicating poverty and improving livesShare ofthe poorest quintile in national consumptionisthe share ofconsumption (or,in some cases,income) thataccrues to the poorest 20 percent ofthe population.Data onpersonal or household income or consumption come fromnationally representative household surveys.The data in thetable refer to different years between 1987 and 2001.Foot-notes to the data indicate whether the ranking are based onper capital income or consumption.Each distribution isbased on percentiles ofpopulation-rather than ofhouse-holds-with households ranked by income or expenditure perperson.Prevalence ofchild malnutritionis the percentage ofchildren under \ufb01ve whose weight for age is less than minustwo standard deviations from the median for the interna-tional reference population ages 0\u201359 months.The referencepopulation,adopted by the World Health Organization in1983,is based on children from the United States,who areassumed to be well nourished.Estimates ofchild malnutri-tion are from national survey data.The proportion ofchil-dren who are underweight is the most common indicator ofmalnutrition.Being underweight,even mildly,increases therisk ofdeath and inhibits cognitive development in children.29_WDR_pgs 264-272.qxd  8/14/03  4:13 PM  Page 265\x0c(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank\n\nMoreover,it perpetuates the problem from one generationto the next,as malnourished women are more likely to havelow-birth-weight babies.Primary completion rateis the total number ofstudentssuccessfully completing (or graduating from) the last year ofprimary school in a given year,divided by the total number ofchildren ofof\ufb01cial graduation age in the population.The pri-mary completion rate re\ufb02ects the primary cycle as nationallyde\ufb01ned,ranging from three to four years ofprimary educa-tion (in a very small number ofcountries) to \ufb01ve or six years(in most countries) and seven or eight years (in a relativelysmall number ofcountries).For any country it is thereforeconsistent with the gross and net enrollment ratios.Thenumerator may include coverage children who have repeatedone or more grades ofprimary school but are now graduat-ing successfully as well as who entered school early.Thedenominator is the number ofchildren ofof\ufb01cial graduationage,which could cause the primary completion rate to exceed100 percent.There are other limitations that contribute tocompletion rates exceeding 100 percent,such as the use ofestimates for population,different times ofthe year that theschool and population surveys are conducted,and other dis-crepancies in the numbers used in the calculation Ratio offemale to male enrollments in primary and sec-ondary schoolis the ratio ofthe number offemale studentsenrolled in primary and secondary school to the number ofmale students.Eliminating gender disparities in educationwould help to increase the status and capabilities ofwomen.This indicator is an imperfect measure ofthe relative accessi-bility ofschooling for girls.With a target date of2005,this isthe \ufb01rst ofthe targets to fall due.School enrollment data arereported to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics by nationaleducation authorities.Primary education provides childrenwith basic reading,writing,and mathematics skills alongwith an elementary understanding ofsuch subjects as his-tory,geography,natural science,social science,art,andmusic.Secondary education completes the provision ofbasic education that began at the primary level,and aims atlaying foundations for lifelong learning and human develop-ment,by offering more subject-or skill-oriented instructionusing more specialized teachers.Under-\ufb01ve mortality rateis the probability that a new-born baby will die before reaching age \ufb01ve,ifsubject to cur-rent age-speci\ufb01c mortality rates.The probability is expressedas a rate per 1,000.The main sources ofmortality date arevital registration systems and direct or indirect estimatesbased on sample surveys or censuses.To produce harmo-nized estimates ofunder-\ufb01ve mortality rates that make useofall available information in a transparent way,a method-ology that \ufb01ts a regression line to the relationship betweenmortality rates and their reference dates using weighted leastsquares was developed and adopted by both UNICEF andthe World Bank.Maternal mortality ratiois the number ofwomen whodie from pregnancy-related causes during pregnancy andchildbirth,per 100,000 live births.The data shown here havebeen collected in various years and adjusted to a common1995 base year.The values are modeled estimates based onan exercise carried out by the World Health Organization(WHO) and United Nations Children\u2019s Fund(UNICEF).Inthis exercise maternal mortality was estimated with a regres-sion model using information on fertility,birth attendants,and HIV prevalence.This cannot be assumed to provide anaccurate estimate ofmaternal mortality in any country inthe table.Births attended by skilled health staffare the percentageofdeliveries attended by personnel trained to give the neces-sary supervision,care,and advice to women during preg-nancy,labor,and the postpartum period,to conduct deliver-ies on their own,and to care for newborns.The share ofbirths attended by skilled health staffis an indicator ofahealth system\u2019s ability to provide adequate care for a preg-nant women.Good antenatal and postnatal care improvesmaternal health and reduces maternal and infant mortality.But data may not re\ufb02ect such improvements because healthinformation system are often weak,material deaths areunderreported,and rates ofmaternal mortality are dif\ufb01cultto measure.Table 3.Expenditures on education and healthPublic expenditure per studentis the public current spend-ing on education divided by the number ofstudents by level,as a percentage ofgross domestic product (GDP) per capita.Data on education are compiled by the UNESCO Institutefor Statistics from of\ufb01cial responses to surveys and fromreports provided by education authorities in each country.The data on education spending in the table refer solely topublic spending\u2014government spending on public educa-tion plus subsidies for private education.The data generallyexclude foreign aid for education.They may also excludespending by religious schools,which play a signi\ufb01cant role inmany developing countries.Data for some countries and forsome years refer to spending by the ministry ofeducationonly (excluding education expenditures by other ministriesand departments and local authorities).Recurrent spending on primary teacher salaries is thetotal amount spent on primary as a percent oftotal recur-rent spending on primary education (the latter includingspending on personnel other than teachers).The data referto the primary education level ofthe education system only.For countries with a \ufb01ve or six year primary system,the dataare for the of\ufb01cial primary cycle.For countries with primarysystems either longer than 6 years,or shorter than 5 years,the data are an estimate ofa hypothetical 6-year equivalentsystem (although based on actual enrollment,teacher,spending data,etc.through grade 6 in that country).The266WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 200429_WDR_pgs 264-272.qxd  8/14/03  4:14 PM  Page 266\x0c(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank\n\ndata are estimates for 2000 based on the latest years forwhich data are available.The data are derived from Bruns,Mingat,and Rakatomalala (2003).Incidence ofeducationexpenditures (lowest and highest quintiles).Incidence ofeducation and health expenditures (lowestand highest quintiles).Average expenditure incidence stud-ies relate household data on the use ofpublic services by dif-ferent quintiles ofthe population to average spending onthose services by the government.Results from these studiesprovide a cross-sectional snapshot ofwho bene\ufb01ts frompublic spending on services.Note that this is not necessarilythe same as who would bene\ufb01t from the marginal resourcesdevoted to the sector.The data are accompanied by severalcaveats.First,while the data are often based on the bestsources available,they are often limited when it comes toassessing the unit costs ofservices.Second,cross-countrycomparability is hampered by the fact that studies differ inthe detail to which they differentiate average spending:forexample some use a uniform estimate,some estimate sepa-rate unit costs for urban and rural areas,some for differentprovinces,and so on.Third,since the value ofspendingmight differ for different populations (for example spendingon urban dwellers might go much further towards providingquality services than an equal amount spent on people inremote rural areas) the label \u201cexpenditure incidence\u201dis dis-tinguished from \u201cbene\ufb01t incidence\u201d.Fourth,the results donot include the incidence ofraising funds.A fairly regressivepattern ofspending might still be pro-poor ifit is \ufb01nancedthrough a very progressive tax system.Fifth,it is hard toknow what a \u201cgood\u201dallocation is without comparing it toother types ofsocial spending.Details on the sources forthese results,as well as a disaggregation by types ofexpendi-tures,are available in Filmer (2003) WDR Background Note.Public health expenditureconsists ofrecurrent and cap-ital spending from government (central and local) budgets,external borrowings and grants (including donations frominternational agencies and nongovernmental organizations),and social (or compulsory) health insurance funds.The datain the table are the product ofan effort by the World HealthOrganization (WHO),the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),and the World Bankto collect all available information on health expendituresfrom national and local government budgets,nationalaccounts,household surveys,insurance publications,inter-national donors,and existing tabulations.Private health expenditure includes direct household(out-of-pocket) spending,private insurance,spending bynon-pro\ufb01t institutions serving households (other thansocial insurance),and direct service payments by privatecorporations.The data in the table are the product ofaneffort by the World Health Organization (WHO),the Orga-nization for Economic Co-operation and Development(OECD),and the World Bank to collect all available infor-mation on health expenditures from national and local gov-ernment budgets,national accounts,household surveys,insurance publications,international donors,and existingtabulations.Total health expenditure is the sum ofpublic and privatehealth expenditure.It covers the provision ofhealth services(preventive and curative),family planning activities,nutri-tion activities,and emergency aid designated for health butdoes not include provision ofwater and sanitation.The datain the table are the product ofan effort by the World HealthOrganization (WHO),the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),and the World Bankto collect all available information on health expendituresfrom national and local government budgets,nationalaccounts,household surveys,insurance publications,inter-national donors,and existing tabulations.Table 4.Service indicatorsPrimary teacher absence rateis the percentage ofprimaryschool teachers who were absent from a random sample ofschools during surprise visits.Absenteeism ofpublic servants from their jobs has longbeen discussed as an impediment to effective public servicedelivery in developing countries,yet there has been relativelylittle systematic empirical evidence on this issue.As back-ground research for this World Development Report,severalcountry studies were conducted.A multi-county studyBangladesh,Ecuador,India (20 States),Indonesia,Peru,andUganda (Chaudhury and others 2003).Additional studieswith virtually identical methodologies were conduncted inPapua New Guinea (NRI and World Bank 2003) and Zambia(Habyarimana and others 2003).The common survey methodology was built aroundunannounced visits to a nationally representative randomsample ofprimary schools and primary health care centers.The study used clustered random sampling:after stratifyingeach country (or Indian state) geographically,districts wererandomly selected on a population-weighted basis,and thenfacilities were randomly selected in each district.Enumera-tors visited each facility and,after verifying workers\u2019sched-ules,recorded which ofthem were absent.The \ufb01gures in the table are preliminary calculations,based on data from surveys conducted mostly in late 2002and early 2003.Further research will re\ufb01ne the calculations,in some cases drawing on data from additional visits to eachfacility.In addition,these facility surveys have collected awealth ofinformation now being used to probe the causes ofteacher and health personnel absence in the different coun-tries.Note that these studies did not measure \u201cabsenteeism,\u201dwhich is a term that is usually used to imply unjusti\ufb01able orunexplained absence,but instead reported on rates of\u201cabsence.\u201dThat is,they reported the number ofstaffwhoSelected World Development Indicators26729_WDR_pgs 264-272.qxd  8/14/03  4:14 PM  Page 267\x0c(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank\n\nwere supposed to be on duty but were in fact absent from thefacility - without regard to the reasons for absence.Manypersonnel were doubtless absent for valid reasons,such asauthorized leave or of\ufb01cial duties.Nevertheless,we reportthe absence rates for two reasons:\ufb01rst,because the reasonsfor absence given by facility directors were typically not veri-\ufb01able;and second,because even authorized absences reducethe quantity and quality ofpublic services in these primaryschools and primary health centers.Primary pupil-teacher ratio is the number ofpupilsenrolled in primary school divided by the number ofpri-mary school teachers (regardless oftheir teaching assign-ment).The comparability ofpupil-teacher ratios acrosscountries is affected by the de\ufb01nition ofteachers and by dif-ferences in class size by grade and in the number ofhourstaught.Moreover,the underlying enrollment levels are sub-ject to a variety ofreporting errors.They are based on datacollected during annual school surveys,which are typicallyconducted at the beginning ofthe school year.They do notre\ufb02ect actual number ofattendance.And school administra-tors may report exaggerated enrollments,especially ifthereis a \ufb01nancial incentive to do so.While the pupil-teacher ratiois often used to compare the quality ofschooling acrosscountries,it is often weakly related to the value added ofschooling systems (Behrman and Rosenzweig 1994).Thedata are from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics,whichcompiles international data on education in cooperationwith national commissions and national statistical services.Trained teachers in primary school:are the percentageofprimary school teachers who have received the minimumorganized teacher training (preservice or in service) requiredfor teaching.The share oftrained teachers in primaryschools measures the quality ofthe teaching staff.It does nottake account ofcompetencies acquired by teachers throughtheir professional experience or self-instruction,or ofsuchfactors as work experience,teaching methods and materials,or classroom conditions,all ofwhich may affect the qualityofteaching.Since the training teachers receive varies greatly,care should be taken in comparing across countries.Thedata are from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics,whichcompiles international data on education in cooperationwith national commissions and national statistical services.Health personnel absence rate is the percentage ofmed-ical personnel at primary health clinics who were absentfrom a random sample ofschools during surprise visits."]...Total Sentences # :

u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']While 'megacities' with more than 10 million inhabitants have distinctive challenges, their contribution to global urban \ngrowth will remain comparatively small.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']This assessment estimates that between 60\u201380% of final energy \nuse globally is urban, with a central estimate of 75%.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Applying national energy (or GHG inventory) reporting formats \nto the urban scale and to urban administrative boundaries is often referred to as a \u2018production\u2019 accounting approach \nand underlies the above GEA estimate.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']This contrasts to a \u2018consumption\u2019 accounting approach that pro-rates associated \nenergy uses per unit of urban consumer expenditures, thus allocating energy uses to urban consumers irrespective \nof the form energy is used (direct or embodied energy) or its location (within or outside a city\u2019s administrative \nboundary).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_12']Available consumption-based energy accounts for cities are too limited (estimates exist for only a handful \nof megacities) to allow generalization but it is highly likely that urban energy use under a consumption accounting \napproach approximates the urban share in the world GDP, estimated by this assessment to be some 80%.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']There is great \nheterogeneity in urban energy-use patterns as revealed by this assessment drawing together a novel urban energy use \ndata set.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']In many developing countries, urban dwellers use substantially  more  final energy per capita than their rural \ncompatriots.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_9', 'SDG_11']Conversely, in many industrialized countries \nper capita final energy use of city dwellers is often  lower  than the national average, which reflects the effects of compact \nurban form, settlement types (multi- versus single-family dwellings) and availability and/or practicability of public \ntransport infrastructure systems compared with those in the suburban or rural sprawl.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The few available data, however, \nsuggest that urban energy use in high-income countries is not substantially different from the national average when \nusing a consumption-based accounting approach, whereas in low-income countries the urban-rural energy difference is \nlikely to be even larger under this alternative energy accounting method.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']However, because of \ncomplexities in systems boundaries and accounting, urban studies need to adhere to high standards in terms of clarity \nand documentation of the terminology, methodology, and documentation of underlying energy data used.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']Addressing Urban Challenges \n\n Rapid migration rates and

electricity (and other basic services like water, sanitation, and transport) live in informal settlements.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']It is mostly \nin situations where the often antagonistic relationship between local government and the inhabitants of informal \n\n1310\n\n\x0cChapter 18 \n\nUrban Energy Systems\n\nsettlements has changed, through widespread public support to upgrade \u2018slums\u2019 and squatters, that clean energy and \nelectricity and other public services have reached the urban poor.", u"['SDG_6', 'SDG_7', 'SDG_9', 'SDG_11']Housing, water supply and sanitation infrastructure, energy, and transport services are the key sustainability challenges \nto accommodate some three billion additional urban dwellers in the decades to come, especially in low-income \ncountries.", u"['SDG_9', 'SDG_11']Informal settlements will often be one of the transitional forms of settlement for many of these new urban \ndwellers and will require a much more proactive, anticipatory policy approach, especially with respect to the location \nof informal settlements and subsequent infrastructure connections and upgrading programs.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_12', 'SDG_13']From all the major determinants of urban energy use \u2013 climate, position in the global economy, consumption patterns, \nquality of built environment, urban form and density (including transport systems), and urban energy systems and their \nintegration \u2013 only the final three are amenable to policymaking by city administrations, at least partially.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Therefore, both \nin terms of leverage and potentials, energy policy at the urban scale needs to focus above all on  demand management  \nwith a focus on energy efficient buildings, structuring urban form and density conductive to energy efficient housing forms, \nhigh-quality public transport services, and to urban energy systems integration.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']This demand-side focus at the urban scale \nrepresents a paradigm shift compared to the traditional, more supply-side energy policy focus at the national scale.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Systemic  characteristics of urban energy use are generally more important determinants of the efficiency of urban energy \nuse than those of individual consumers or of technological artifacts.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']For instance, the share of high occupancy public and/\nor non-motorized transport modes in urban mobility is a more important determinant of urban transport energy use than \nthe efficiency of the urban vehicle fleet (be it buses or hybrid automobiles).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Evidently, urban \npolicies need to address both systemic and individual characteristics in urban energy use, but their different long-term \nleverage effects should structure policy attention and perseverance.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']In terms of urban energy-demand management, \nthe quality of the built environment (buildings efficiency) and urban form and density that, to a large degree, structure \nurban transport energy use are roughly of equal importance.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Locally harvested  renewables can, at best, \nprovide 1% of the energy needs of a megacity and a few percentage points in smaller, low-density cities because of the \nmismatch between (high) urban energy demand density and (low) renewable energy supply densities at the local level.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']Urban Policy Choices and Priorities \n\n The historical evolutionary processes that govern urban growth have largely been  path dependent  with variation \nthat played out differently over time and space.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Cities that evolved along alternative pathways have alternative \n\n1311\n\n\x0cUrban Energy Systems \n\nChapter 18\n\ndensity levels from high-density \u2018Asian\u2019 (e.g., Tokyo, Shanghai, Mumbai) and \u2018old European\u2019 (e.g., London, Madrid, \nWarsaw) to low density \u2018new frontier\u2019 (e.g., Los Angeles, Brasilia, Melbourne) pathways, each of which have different \nstructural options available to improve energy efficiency and optimize urban energy and transport systems in terms of \nsustainability criteria.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']First, the implications of urban density on the requirements of urban energy systems are that they need to be \nbasically  pollution free , as otherwise even relatively clean energy forms can quickly overwhelm the assimilative \ncapacity of urban environments.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Thus, \nin the long-term all end-use energy fuels burnt in urban areas need to be of zero-emission quality.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Natural gas plays \nthe role of the transitional fuel of choice in many urban areas.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']This \u2018zero-emission\u2019 requirement for urban energy \ntranscends the customary sustainability divide between fossil and renewable energies, as even \u2018carbon-neutral\u2019 \nbiofuels when used by millions of automobiles in an urban environment will produce unacceptable levels of NO  x   or \nO 3  pollution.", u"['SDG_9', 'SDG_11']The observed significant improvements in urban air quality caused by the elimination of traditional air \npollutants, such as soot, particles, and SO 2 , in cities of high-income countries are a powerful illustration that cities \nact as innovation centers and hubs for environmental improvements that can lead to a sustainability transition \npath.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']An \nimportant feature of these regulatory approaches is  dynamic target setting  to reflect changing technology options \nand to counter the consequences of urban growth and potential consumer \u2018take-back\u2019 effects.", u"['SDG_3', 'SDG_11']Air pollution is also \nthe area of urban environmental policymaking where the most significant co-benefits of policies can be realized: \nimproving access to clean cooking fuels, for example, improves human health and lowers traditional pollutant \nemissions, and also has (through reduced black carbon emissions) significant net global warming co-benefits.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Zoning and parking regulation, combined with public transport policies and policies that promote non-motorized \ntransport modes and walkability thus constitute the essential \u2018building blocks\u2019 of urban energy efficiency and \nsustainability \u2018policy packages.\u2019 \n\n  1   \n\n  i.e., a minimum density level over the entire settlement area that comprises residential zones of higher density with low density green spaces.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Bus-based \nRapid Transit systems (BRT) with own dedicated lanes are, therefore, a much more attractive option for many cities in \nlow-income countries than are capital-intensive subway or light-rail systems, even though, in the long term, the latter \noffer the possibility of higher passenger fluxes and greater energy efficiency.", u"['SDG_6', 'SDG_7', 'SDG_11']A common characteristic of sustainable urban energy system options and policies is that they are usually systemic: \nfor example, the integration of land-use and urban transport planning that extends beyond traditional administrative \nboundaries; the increasing integration of urban resource streams, including water, wastes, and energy, that can further \nboth resource (e.g., heat) recovery and improve environmental performance.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']This view of a more integrated (and \noften also more decentralized) urban infrastructures also offers possibilities to improve the resilience and security of \nurban energy systems.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_11']The \nurban governance paradox is compounded by weak institutional capacities, especially in small- to medium-sized cities \nthat are the focus of projected urban growth, as well as from the legacies of market deregulation and privatization that \nhave made integrated urban planning and coordinated energy, transport, and other infrastructural policy approaches \nmore difficult to design and yet more difficult to implement.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_9', 'SDG_11']Urban areas will continue to act as innovation centers for experimentation and as diffusion nodes for the introduction \nof new systems and individual technological options by providing critical niche market sizes in the needed transition \ntoward more sustainable urban energy systems.", u"['SDG_7',

dominant form of spatial organization in which \npeople live, economies operate, technologies are generated and used, \ncorresponding  demands  for   energy  services   arise  and  environmental \nsustainability  is  critically  defined.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The  decade  2000\u20132010  marked  an \nimportant watershed in human history: for the first time more than 50% \nof the global population are urban dwellers and estimates indicate that \nalready some three-quarters of global (direct) final energy use is urban, \nwith corresponding primary energy and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions \nprobably being comparable.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Given the robust trends toward a convergence of much of the developing \nworld to levels of urbanization already found in the developed world, the \nenergy and sustainability challenges of equitable access to clean-energy \nservices, of energy security, and of environmental compatibility at local \nthrough global scales cannot be addressed without explicit consideration \nof urban energy systems and their specific sustainability challenges and \nopportunities.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The  future  development  of  the  demand  side  for  energy \ncannot be described without understanding changes at the level of the \nurban settlements.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Just  as  it  is \npossible \u2018to fail to see the forest for the trees,\u2019 it is possible \u2018to fail to see \nthe city for the buildings.\u2019 Hence the GEA includes a specific chapter on \nurbanization and urban energy use.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The  study  of  urban  energy  must  take  this  diversity  and \nuncertainty into account.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Accordingly, this chapter draws attention to \nthe limits of comparability and policy guidance of existing studies that \nsuffer from inconsistent or unclear system boundaries and accounting \nmethodologies, and concludes with the need to develop clear methods \nand guidelines for a range of complementary urban energy accounting \ntools to guide policy.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_15']Thus, an \n urban energy system  comprises all components related to the use and \n\n1314\n\nChapter 18\n\nprovision  of  energy  services  associated  with  a  functional  urban  sys-\ntem, irrespective where the associated energy use and conversion are \nlocated in space, such as power plants and transport fuel requirements \nboth locally and internationally (airports, ports).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_12']The full urban energy \nsystem  entails  both  energy  flows  proper  (fuels, \u2018direct\u2019  energy  flows) \nand \u2018embodied\u2019  energy  (energy  used  in  the  production  of  goods  and \nprovision  of  services   imported   into  but  also   exported   from  an  urban \nsystem).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_11']The functional perspective of urban energy systems highlights \nthat urban locations and their growth (urbanization) are not only the \nlocations of people and economic activities in space, but also include \nthe types of activities they pursue and the infrastructural and functional \nframing  conditions  (service  functions)  urban  agglomerations  provide.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Functional characteristics increasingly define urban areas and need to \nbe reflected in urban energy systems analysis, and thus need to com-\nbine both \u2018production\u2019 and \u2018consumption\u2019 perspectives.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']From a spatial \nperspective, this chapter also extends \u2013 within the limits of available \ndata \u2013 the traditional discussion of cities as defined by political and/or \nadministrative boundaries toward urban agglomerations, including \u2018per-\niurban\u2019 and larger metropolitan

systems  is  characterized  by \nspecific challenges and opportunities.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The high density of population, \neconomic  activities,  and  resulting  energy  use  severely  limit  an  obvi-\nous sustainable energy choice: In many larger cities locally harnessed \nrenewables  can  provide  for  only  some   one  per  cent   of  urban  energy \nuse which implies large-scale  imports  of renewable energies generated \nelsewhere, much like in the currently dominating fossil energy systems.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The diversity of activities and energy uses characteristic of urban sys-\ntems opens numerous opportunities for intelligent energy management \nand \u2018recycling\u2019 (e.g., electricity-heat cogeneration and \u2018heat cascading\u2019, \nin which different energy end uses can \u2018feed\u2019 on waste energy flows \nfrom  energy  conversion  and  industrial  applications).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Both   diversity \nand density  (at least above a critical threshold value of some 50\u2013150 \ninhabitants/ha) can be considered as key  strategic assets  of urban areas \nthat help to use energy more efficiently by energy-systems integration, \ncompact energy-efficient housing, and co-location of activities that can \nhelp to minimize transport distances and automobile dependence.", u"['SDG_6', 'SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The vital urban infrastructures all depend on energy: water supply, treat-\nment and waste water disposal, transport and communication systems, \ncomplex webs of food and material supplies, the resulting disposal of \nwastes, and, of course, energy supply itself.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The urban scale is also the appropriate one \nto identify and realize many options in promoting energy efficiency that \nmay not always be apparent at higher levels of policymaking.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']18.1.1   \n\n  Objectives and Approach \n\n Given the above, the broad objective is to address urban energy issues \nin  an  increasingly  urbanizing  world  from  a   systemic   perspective  that \nfocuses on the specific energy challenges and opportunities represented \nby urban settlements.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The specific objectives of this chapter are to perform first a global assess-\nment to establish the order of magnitude of urban energy systems and \ntheir drivers, then develop some generalized hypotheses to understand \nurban energy use, its differences and dynamics, and finally test these \nhypotheses through case studies at the local and regional levels, draw-\ning on specific examples of individual cities.", u"['SDG_9', 'SDG_11']It adds to the information and knowledge of \nthe sectorial GEA chapters (buildings, industry, transport) by address-\ning the  integrated  issues specific and unique to urban systems.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Sectoral \n perspectives are therefore addressed here only to the extent that they \ncontain an explicit urban specificity, e.g., (public) urban transport sys-\ntems, or urban energy cogeneration systems.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The lit-\nerature on urban land use and urban land-cover changes, while most \nvaluable for describing a physical dimension of urbanization, is of lim-\nited use in an energy assessment despite the richness of quantitative \ndata available.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_9', 'SDG_11']After all, it is not the square kilometers of urban extent \nthat can explain urban energy use, but only the linkage of urban land \nuse  with  demographic  and  economic  data  and  characteristics  as \nreflected  through  urban  form  and  population  density,  infrastructure \nendowments, level and structure of economic activities, lifestyles of \ncity  dwellers,  among  other  factors.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Therefore,   demographics   (popu-\nlation)  is  adopted  quite  naturally  as  a  fundamental  driver  and  core \nmetric to discuss urbanization and urban energy use, drawing on the \nurban land-use change and economics literature only to the degree \nnecessary to understand urban energy use and its variation through \nderived metrics centered on population, like population density, or per \ncapita incomes and expenditures, in addition to more narrow discipli-\nnary  land-use  and  economic  metrics,  such  as  urban  extents/form  or \neconomic structure.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']As comprehensive energy

systems, such as urban transport, urban energy infra-\nstructure  planning,  design  and  implementation,  and  urban  air- quality \nmanagement  are  discussed.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Section  18.5   also  includes  novel  model \nsimulations to illustrate the respective impacts of policy interventions \nalong three main opportunity areas: urban form and density (and their \ninfluence on transport energy demand), buildings efficiency, and urban \nenergy systems integration and optimization.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Understanding the consequences of urbanization on energy use \nin general, however, is an area of research that has attained surprisingly \n\nlittle attention in empirical studies, given the relevance of urban areas \nfor overall energy demand (IEA,  2008 ), their particular vulnerability to \nenergy  supply  disruption,  and  their  potential  for  energy  savings  and \nclimate-change mitigation.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The economic, geographic, and sociological perspectives of urbanization \nare discussed in greater detail as driving forces of urban energy demand \n(see  Section 18.5.2 ).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Along  with  economics  it  is  also  the  dimension \nwith the closest direct causal link to urban energy use.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The economic, geographical, and socio-\nlogical  perspectives  of  urbanization  in  turn  are  discussed  in  greater \ndetail as driving forces of urban energy demand (see  Section 18.5.2  \nbelow).", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']growth  (the  twin  result  of  natural  growth  in  urban  populations  plus \nnet in-migration into cities) exceeded significantly that of the overall \npopulation and resulted in a secular trend toward  urbanization  (i.e., an \nincrease in the rate or percentage of a population living in urban areas).", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_9', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_12']Cities and their associated urban \nagglomerations have and continue to play key roles as centers of gov-\nernment, production, and trade, as well as knowledge, innovation, and \nproductivity growth (UN,  2008 ).", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']Against  this  background,  the  growth  of  the  global  urban  population \nis estimated to range from some additional 2.7 to 3.2 billion people, \ndepending on the projected urbanization rate of growth (see  Box 18.1 ).", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']The generally larger growth of the projected urban population not only \nmeans that urban settlements will absorb all of the population growth \nbetween 2005 and 2050, but also that there will be a sizable redistribu-\ntion of rural populations to urban areas.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']In addition, urban growth will \nbe predominantly a phenomenon of the less-developed regions.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']The continued growth of the world\u2019s urban popu-\nlation is set against a different growth path of the rural population.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']The method uses the growth difference \nbetween urban and rural populations or between city populations and total urban populations to model the dynamics of the urbanization \nprocess, an approach that is equivalent to a logistic curve \ufb01 t (UN DESA,  1974 ).", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']Starting with the most recent observed growth rates, future \ntrends are calculated by taking into account the empirical observations that the pace of urbanization slows down as the proportion of the urban \npopulation increases (a characteristic feature of logistic growth processes beyond the 50% level of its asymptote).", u"['SDG_11', 'SDG_13']For an OECD study on the climate vulnerability of port cities, Nicholls et al.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']( 2008 ) \nextend the UN projections to 2100 and then apply a constant growth fraction to port cities at the national level to

the 2008  World Energy Outlook  (IEA,  2008 ), a separate chapter is \ndevoted to urban energy use and contains estimates of 2006 base-\nyear urban primary energy use data and a reference scenario

urbanization rate (41% compared to 81% in the United \nStates),  but  is  explained  by  the  substantially  higher  urban  energy \nuse in Chinese cities compared to the national average because of \nhigher  urban  incomes  and  industrial  activities.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The IEA ( 2008 ) estimates urban primary energy use at the global level \nto amount to some 330 EJ in the year 2006, or 67% of world primary \nenergy  use.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Using  an  average  global  primary-to-final  energy  conver-\nsion efficiency of about 69%, the estimate translates to 230 EJ urban \nfinal

electricity, assuming that the primary \nenergy mix of cities is the same as at the national or regional average.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']This assumption is problematic, especially for countries of low-income, \nlow-urbanization, particularly in Asia and Africa, where available data \nsuggest that urban energy use structures are, in fact, very different from \nrural and national averages.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Urban energy use is invariably character-\nized by much higher shares of grid-dependent energy carriers (electri-\ncity and gas) and by much lower reliance on traditional biomass fuels.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']This simplifying assumption in the IEA ( 2008 ) study also diminishes the \nplausibility of the study\u2019s scenario projections by primary energy carrier \nto 2030, where total urban primary energy use is projected to grow by \nsome 56% from 2006 to 2030.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_11']In the IEA reference scenario almost \n90% of global energy growth to 2030 is projected to result from urban \nenergy use.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The sce-\nnarios of individual final energy use categories were then aggregated \nper individual grid-cell and overlaid with the

final  energy  use  in  the  IIASA  study  is  estimated \nto  range  from  180  to  250  EJ  with  a  central  estimate  of  240  EJ,  or \nbetween 56% and 78% (central estimate, 76%) of total final energy.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']So, in terms of final energy use (as opposed to primary energy use \nreported in the IEA study), cities use 240 EJ, or some three-quarters, \nof final energy worldwide.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']13   \nReaders should not be confused by the somewhat higher urban per-\ncentage  (76%)  of  urban   final  energy   use  of  the  IIASA  study  when \ncompared  to  the  67%  estimate  of  the  IEA  for   primary  energy   use.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']As discussed above, the assumed identity in urban fuel and energy \nmix with national and/or regional averages in the IEA study under-\nestimates the level of high-quality, processed-energy forms in urban \nareas that entail correspondingly higher upstream energy-conversion \nlosses.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']If  this  simplifying  assumption  in  the  IEA  calculations  could \nbe relaxed, the corresponding urban primary energy estimate would \nbecome higher and much closer to the three-quarter benchmark of \nthe IIASA study.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']These observations are corroborated by commercial final energy use in \nurban  areas,  i.e.,  excluding  traditional  biomass  use.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']For  industrialized \ncountries, estimates of urban commercial fuel use are identical to the \ntotals reported in  Table 18.7 .", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']For  sub-Saharan  Africa,  estimates  suggest  that \n4 EJ, or some 80% of all commercial energy use, can be classified as \nurban (compared to 8 EJ and 54% for total final energy, see  Table 18.7 ).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Differences for South Asia are also noticeable: 8 EJ, or 71% of final com-\nmercial  energy,  are  classified  as  urban,  compared  to  10  EJ  and  51% \nfor total final energy.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Differences for the other developing GEA regions \nare comparatively minor, as little noncommercial energy continues to be \nused in cities.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The higher urban share in commercial energy results both \nfrom higher urban incomes and better urban energy access and infra-\nstructure endowments, particularly the much higher degrees of electri-\nfication in urban areas.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Nonetheless, despite some uncertainties  14   (see  Table 18.7 ), both the \nIEA and the IIASA estimates confirm a highly policy-relevant finding: \nWhile  some  50%  of  the  world\u2019s  population  is  urban,   urban  energy \nalready dominates global energy use , which means that the energy \nsustainability challenges need to be solved predominantly for urban \nsystems.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']13   \n\n  14   \n\n  The lack of available IEA regional estimates limits the possibilities for a more detailed \ncomparison, but in the reported four IEA regions, urban energy use is within the \nrespective minima/maxima regional values of the IIASA study.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The main source of uncertainty for the ranges reported in  Table 18.7  is the fuzziness \nin delineating urban areas and population and hence the attribution of national \nenergy use to the urban category.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Conversely, the uncertainty in energy statistics \nis

of three urban areas having  higher per capita final energy \nuse  compared to their respective national averages.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Among non-Annex-\nI countries there is pronounced  regional heterogeneity : Africa and Latin \nAmerica  share  the  prevalence  of   lower  than  national  average  urban \nper capita final energy use , in contrast to Asia where urban per cap-\nita final energy use is predominantly (37 out of 50 cases)  higher than \n\nthe national average .", u"['SDG_9', 'SDG_11']To explain these differences requires further analysis, but preliminary \nfindings suggest that differences in levels of incomes and in economic \nstructure (degree of service versus industry orientation of urban econ-\nomies) are likely to be the main explanatory variables.",

\u2018embodied\u2019 energy use (corrected \nfor net trade of imports and exports of manufactured goods and services \nfrom and to urban economies) is likely to weaken the conclusion of a \n\nlower  urban  energy  footprint  in  cities  of Annex-I  countries  compared \nto  the  national  average  (see   Section  18.2.4   above)  as  lower  (direct) \nfinal urban energy use is likely to be

compared  to  rural \nareas in Annex-I countries illustrates well the  urban comparative advan-\ntage for a sustainability transition : urban areas with their corresponding \nmore energy-efficient

areas,  cities  not  only  have \nhigher (direct) final energy use, they also have generally much higher \nincomes.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_12']Thus, the urban-rural gradient in terms of per

u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']In \npractically all urban settlements of the third group of non-Annex-I coun-\ntries energy intensity is above 10 MJ/$ (up to 39 MJ/$ in the sample).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The Annex-I city panel \nin general appears more coherent in final energy use patterns.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']First, the \ncorrelation between higher urban incomes and higher final energy use \ntends  to  weaken  significantly,  with  richer  cities  not  necessarily  using \nmore (direct) final energy on a per capita basis (but highly likely to use \nmuch more embodied energy compared to poorer cities).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Second, there \nis a strong and inverse correlation between urban incomes and energy \nintensity, with the latter falling with rising urban incomes.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Also, within the panel \nof Annex-I countries there is a large variation in energy use per capita \n(with some urban areas using more than 600 GJ/capita final energy).", u"['SDG_7',

decline in energy inten-\nsity at higher per capita incomes.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']At lower income ranges, however, the \ndata  in  our  sample  are  sparse,  and  often  also  exclude  the  dominant

discussion of energy access and poverty within an urban \ncontext ( Section 18.4.1 ).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The discussion then moves on to the nexus of \nurban energy use and urban environmental quality and the challenges \nimposed by the high densities of energy demand and the correspond-\ning need for efficient and low-emission energy systems ( Section 18.4.2 ).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Lastly,  Section 18.4.3  discusses the challenges for urban energy infra-\nstructures, including reliability and security.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Other  urban  development  challenges  with  more  indirect  implications \non energy, such as urban transport, land-use, and density planning, are \ndiscussed  Section 18.5 .", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']However, this \nis  not  an  appropriate  measure  for  much  of  the  urban  population  in \nlow-income and some middle-income nations because their incomes \nare so low in relation to the costs of food and necessities other than \nfood that their energy use is very low.", u"['SDG_1', 'SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Thus,  for  nations  with  a  proportion  of  fuel  use  from  noncommercial \nfuels and where low-income urban households keep energy expendi-\ntures down by using dirty fuels (including wastes) or cutting fuel use, \nthe  proportion  of  income  spent  on  energy  is  not  a  good  indicator  of \npoverty.", u"['SDG_1', 'SDG_7', 'SDG_11']18   \n\n Thus, the two most common implications of poverty in regard to energy \nuse among urban populations in low- and most middle-income nations \nare, first, use of the cheapest fuels and energy-using equipment (includ-\ning stoves, which bring disadvantages, especially in regard to indoor air \npollution, inefficient fuel combustion, and convenience) and, second, no \naccess to electricity.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_9', 'SDG_11']As above\n\nInformal settlement 1: squatter settlements (in many cities \nthese house 30\u201360% of the entire population)\n\nInformal settlement 2: housing in illegal subdivision\n\nIn low-income nations, usually reliance on dirtier fuels and \nlack of electricity; in many middle-income nations less so; for \nmany households, part of fuel/electricity expenditure is for \n\nlivelihoods in the home; illegal electricity connections may be \n\ncommon; often high risks from accidental \ufb01 res\n\nMore expensive than illegal land

fuels.", u"['SDG_9', 'SDG_11']Low-income groups in urban areas face limited choices in renting, buy-\ning,  or  building  accommodation  that  they  can  afford  and  so  have  to \nmake  trade-offs  between  a  good  location,  housing  size  and  quality, \ninfrastructure and service provision, and secure tenure (see references \n\n Table 18.9 ).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']18.4.1.3   \n\n  Urban Populations and Energy use in Low- and \nMiddle-Income Nations \n\n There are some general statistics on the forms of energy use for urban \npopulations \u2013 for instance, in what fuels (and mix of fuels) are used and \nwhether  or  not  they  have  access  to  electricity  ( Table  18.10 ).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']However, \nthere are no general statistics on how fuel use and access to electricity \nvary within nations\u2019 urban populations or within cities by income group.", u"['SDG_3', 'SDG_11']The only exception is the very considerable documentation on \nthe health impacts of pollution from the use of \u2018dirty\u2019 fuels (and other \nfactors, including poor ventilation and inefficient stoves), although much \nof this literature is for rural households and perhaps underestimates the \nextent of this problem among urban poor households.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Particular studies suggest that it is common for urban poor households \nin Africa and Asia to use a mix of fuels \u2013 for instance, different fuels for \ndifferent kinds of food and fuel-switching at certain times of year when \nfuel prices or household incomes change (see Pachauri and Jiang,  2008  \nfor China and Meikle and North,  2005  for Arusha).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The available data on energy use by low-income urban dwellers range \nfrom very large numbers who use little or no fossil fuels and electricity \n(i.e., wood, dung, straw, and charcoal) through those who use kerosene \nand coal or coal-based fuels to those who use gas (bottled or piped) and \nelectricity.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Available studies also give examples of the scale of the differentials in \nenergy used between high-income and low-income households within \nparticular urban centers; some show that these can vary by a factor of \n10 or more, but of course the scale of the differentials depends, in part, \non how \u2018the urban population\u2019 is divided for this comparison (e.g., dif-\nferentials will be greater if the richest and poorest deciles are compared \ninstead of the richest and poorest quartiles).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']In  India,  fossil-fuel  based  energy  sources \nincreasingly  dominate  the  energy  mix  of  urban  households,  although \nbiomass (including firewood and dung) continues to be used, especially \nby the lowest income groups.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Table 18.10 shows how most (90%) of the urban population in \u2018devel-\noping countries\u2019 had access to electricity and 70% had access to mod-\nern fuels (mostly gas) in 2007 \u2013 but also how the picture on energy \naccess for urban populations was very different for the least-developed \ncountries and for sub-Saharan Africa.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']When considering fuel use among \nurban poor households in all low- and middle-income nations, this var-\nies from, at one extreme, continued reliance on fuelwood, charcoal, and \nwaste materials (and no electricity) through to greater use of solid or \nliquid fossil fuels (coal and/or kerosene, often called transition fuels) and \na proportion of households with electricity, and on to the use of cleaner \nfuels (LPG or connection to gas) and electricity.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']This diversity in the forms of energy used is also likely to be present \nbetween urban poor households within most (but see above).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The only \nobvious  characteristics  that  all  urban  poor  households  share  is  lim-\nited  purchasing  power  for  energy  (for  all  uses)  and  a  desire  to  keep \ncosts down, so their fuel use and fuel-energy mix is much influenced \nby  the  price  and  availability  of  different  fuels  and  electricity.", u"['SDG_6', 'SDG_11']21   Having gas for cooking and hot water (and, where \nneeded, space heating) has great advantages of convenience and of low \ngeneration of indoor air pollution, but in many urban contexts it is only \navailable as LPG canisters (and so less convenient and more expensive \nthan gas piped to the home).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Among  the  low-income  households  in  urban  centers  in  the  lowest-\nincome nations, fuel use is dominated by charcoal, firewood, or organic \nwastes (e.g., dung).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']are cheap \nand that a proportion of the urban population can gather fuel rather \n\n  21   \n\n  Care is needed here: illegal connections are often not providing electricity free as the \nconnection is through another household that charges for this or the occupants are \ntenants and have to pay the landlord extra for electricity.", u"['SDG_3', 'SDG_11']Low-income  urban  households  often  cook  with  solid  fuels  that  pose \nserious  health  threats  to  household  members  from  indoor  air  pollu-\ntion, especially for those with the longest exposure (see  Chapter 4  for \ndetails).", u"['SDG_11', 'SDG_12', 'SDG_15']This reliance on charcoal by large sections of the population of major (and \noften rapidly growing) cities generated concerns regarding its contribution \nto deforestation, although a detailed study in several African nations in \nthe late 1980s found very little evidence of this (Leach and Mearns,  1989 ) \nand a more recent review suggests that fuelwood is seldom a primary \nsource of forest removal, although \u201cin some of the areas where charcoal \nproduction is concentrated, this may be the case\u201d (Arnold et al.,  2006 ).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']LPG and kerosene are highly subsidized in India, but \nnonpoor groups are the main beneficiaries and many low-income urban \nresidents continue to cook with dirtier energy sources (Gangopadhyay \net al.,  2005 ; Pohekar et al.,  2005 ).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']High expenditures on energy \n A considerable range of national and city studies and studies of particu-\nlar settlements show how expenditures on fuels for household use are \nconsistently burdensome for low-income households (but may not show \nup as high expenditures or high proportions of income spent on fuel, as \ndiscussed above).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']In Ethiopia, fuel and power took 11% of expenditure among urban \npoor (Kebede et al.,  2002 ).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']In China, coal is a key heating fuel for the poor, particularly in cold north-\nern cities where heating may take up as much as 40% of households \ntotal energy needs (Pachauri and Jiang,  2008 ).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_9', 'SDG_11']These  positive  developments  illustrate  that  the  proximity  to  existing \nenergy infrastructure in urban areas enables rapid progress when dedi-\ncated  policies  of  connecting  urban  poor  are  in  place.", u"['SDG_3', 'SDG_7', 'SDG_11']In many such nations, more than half the urban popula-\ntion still rely on nonfossil fuel cooking fuels with obvious consequences \nfor health problems (and large health burdens) and for the time needed \nto obtain fuels.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']A high proportion of urban dwellers in low- and middle-income nations \nfind it difficult to afford their \u2018energy bills\u2019 (for fuel and, where available, \nelectricity and expenditure on transport); these often take 10\u201315% of \nhousehold income and for many a higher proportion.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_11']The constraints on supporting the shift to clean fuels and providing all \nurban households with electricity are less in energy policy and far more \nin government policy and daily practice in regard to those who live in \ninformal settlements and work in the informal economy.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']It is mostly in nations where relationships between local government \nand the inhabitants of these informal settlements are not antagonistic, \nwith widespread public support for \u2018slum\u2019 and squatter upgrading, that \nclean energy and electricity reaches urban poor groups.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Despite  being  of  fundamental  importance  in  an  urban \ncontext,  the  literature  on  energy  or  pollution  densities  is  surprisingly \nlimited, apart from that on urban heat island effects, reviewed in detail \nin  Section 18.4.2.4  below.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']18.4.2.2   \n\n  Urban Energy Demand Densities \n\n This  Section  illustrates  the  concept  of  energy  supply  and  demand \ndensities both generally and by drawing from contrasting examples of \ntwo high-density megacities (Tokyo and London), as well as a small, \nlow-density city (Osnabr \xfc ck, Germany).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Within an urban context particularly, energy demand densities are of \nsignificance.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The twin influences of high population and high income \nmean that the spatial density of energy demand of cities typically ranges \nfrom 10\u2013100 W/m 2 , a range exemplified by cities such as Curitiba (Brazil) \nand Tokyo.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Third, energy-demand densities are signifi-\ncant constraints for the provision of energy services through renewable \nenergies, which (with the exception of geothermal) typically range from \n0.1 to 1 W/m 2  and thus yield a significant mismatch between demand \nand supply at the urban scale.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']From an energy-systems perspective it is important that the prevailing \nhigh energy-demand densities characteristic of urban areas are much \nin line with those of fossil fuel infrastructures and conversion devices \n(Grubler,  2004 ).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The general mismatch between (high) urban energy \ndemand and (low) renewable energy supply densities is shown with \nactual energy demand data for London and Tokyo in  Figure 18.12 .", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Assuming that all the incoming solar radiation could be converted for \nhuman energy use (e.g., to electricity with 20% efficient PV panels), \nthe maximum renewable energy supply density would range from 22 \n(London)  to  31  (Tokyo) W/m 2   in  line  with  average  demand  densities \nin the two cities, but only under the assumption that the entire city \narea could be covered by PV panels!", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']), the results from a low-\ndensity urban area (Osnabr \xfc ck, Germany, see below) of 2% of the city \narea, solar energy could provide a maximum of between 0.4 (London) \nand  0.6 W/m 2   (Tokyo),  which  would  cover  between  2%  (Tokyo\u2019s  23 \nwards) and 1\u20133% (Inner to Greater London) of urban energy use in the \ntwo cities.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Local renewables  can therefore only supply urban energy in \nniche markets (e.g., low-density residential housing), but can provide \n less than 1%  only of a megacity\u2019s energy needs.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']23   \n\n Given that local renewables in large cities are at best marginal niche \noptions (because of the density mismatch between energy demand and \nsupply), what is their potential in small, low-density cities?", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']22   \n\n  23   \n\n  Final energy use within the city limits and excluding bunker fuels (aviation, ship-\nping).", u"['SDG_6', 'SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Conversely, \nconsidering  solar  hot-water  collectors  (with  a  maximum  ef\ufb01 ciency  approaching \n100% of incoming solar energy) also does not change drastically the conclusion of \nthe extremely limited local renewable potentials in high density cities, as solar hot \nwater typically provides only a few percent of energy demand (hot water accounts \nfor 2% of \ufb01 nal energy demand in Europe (Eurostat,  1988 )).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Even if this were pro-\nvided entirely by solar energy where feasible (in low- to medium-density housing, as \nhigh-rise buildings do not offer suf\ufb01 ciently large roof areas) the yield is less than 1% \nof energy demand in a densely populated large city.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']It is of particular interest to interpret the \nOsnabr \xfc ck  results  in  terms  of  their  corresponding  renewable  energy \nsupply density, which adds up to some 0.2 W/m 2  and can be consid-\nered a realistic upper bound of the local renewable energy potential for \nlow-density urban areas.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Generally,  the  areas  available  for  harvesting  local  renewable  energy \nflows  are  higher  for  a   lower   population  density  in  an  urban  area.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']In terms of energy, there is thus an inherent trade-off between urban \nform, transport choices, and the potential of harnessing local renewable \nenergy flows.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Therefore,  if  renewable  energies  are  increasingly  to  supply  the  urban \nenergy needs on a large scale, the resulting needs for conversion and \nlong-distance transport, as well as very large energy \u2018catchment\u2019 areas \n(the \u2018energy footprint\u2019 of cities), needs to be taken into account.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_9', 'SDG_11']Nonetheless, in all \ndensely populated, highly urbanized regions, the majority of renewable \nenergy  supply  has  to  come  from  areas  of  low  population  and  energy-\ndemand densities, where renewable energy flows can be harnessed and \ntransported to the urban energy-use centers, which represents a formida-\nble infrastructure challenge.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The high energy densities of cities require vast energy \u2018hinterlands\u2019 that can be 100\u2013200 times larger than the territorial footprint of cities \nproper requiring long-distance transport of renewable energies.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Renewable energy supply densities in urban areas are therefore maxi-\nmum in the range of 0.2 to 0.5 W/m 2  which are thus between 2 to 5 \npercent of characteristic urban energy demand densities of 10 W/m 2 .", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']From an environmental perspective high urban energy demand and \nthe  resulting  pollution  densities  hold  two  important  implications.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']First,  energy  use  usually  involves  heat  losses  at  well  above  ambi-\nent temperatures and high densities of urban energy use also imply \nhigh densities of urban waste-heat releases.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Second,  fuel  choice  becomes  of  paramount  importance:  pollution-\nintensive  fuels  (biomass  or  coal)  used  at  the  high  demand  densities \nof urban areas quickly result in unacceptably high levels of pollution \nconcentration  (such  as  the  London \u2018killer  smog\u2019  of  1952  or  the  cur-\nrent  air-quality  situation  in  many  cities,  especially  in  the  developing \nworld).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']With \n\nincreasing energy use, the extent of urban heat island effects increases \n( Figure 18.17 ), which results in local warming.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Heat  islands  are,  among  other  factors,  caused  by  urban  energy  use \nthrough anthropogenic heat release.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']As  energy  demand  is  concentrated  particularly  in  urban  cent-\ners,  the  consequential  release  of  anthropogenic  heat  is  similarly \ndense  in  these  areas.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']However, urban heat islands do not always increase urban energy \ndemand.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Reduction in cooling demand can also be achieved through \nthe use of deciduous vegetation for shading (including vertical greening \nof facades) or the application of mechanical shades, shutters, or \u2018smart \n\n  27   \n\n  Assuming about 100 W of biological energy use per person and maximum population \ndensities of 40,000/km 2  in some cities in developing countries, this factor can contrib-\nute up to 4 W/m 2  additional forcing.", u"['SDG_9', 'SDG_11']Albedo  changes  and  the  use  of  reflective  paint  and  sur-\nface material on roofs and transport infrastructure is another particu-\nlarly cost-effective mechanism to reduce heat absorption in urban areas.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']The increasing dependency on power even for simple clerical work, let \nalone  for  critical  functions  like  hospitals,  means  that  stand-by  power \nsupplies could be an increasing

mind,  the  factors  that  determine  urban \nenergy use can be classified into a few major groups:  natural environment  \n(geographic location, climate, and resource endowments),  socioeconomic \ncharacteristics  of a city (household characteristics, economic structure and \ndynamics, demography),  national/international urban function and inte-\ngration  (i.e., the specific roles different cities play in the national and glo-\nbal division of labor, from production and a consumption perspectives), \n urban  energy  systems  characteristics  including  governance  and  access  \n(i.e., the structure and governance of the urban energy supply system and \nits characteristics), and last, but certainly not least,  urban form  (including \nthe  built  urban  environment,  transportation  infrastructure,  and  density \nand functional integration or separation of urban activities).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']These historical legacies may \nhave long-term implications on urban energy use.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_13']Urban energy demand is, \nin principle, not markedly different in its climate dependence than that \nin nonurban settings or national averages, but it is structured by the \ninfluence of other variables, such as urban form (e.g., higher settlement \ndensities lead to smaller per capita residential floor areas), access to \nspecific heating fuels, or income (e.g., more affluent urban households \n\nuse more air conditioning), that can amplify or dampen the effect of \nclimate variations on urban energy demand.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Assuming a residential floor space of 100 m 2 , \na  difference  of  1500  heating  degree-days,  which  is  characteristic \nbetween northern (Denmark) and southern (Greece) Europe, translates \ninto  a  variation  in  residential  energy  demand  between  9  and  24  GJ, \nwhich is significant compared to a typical European household residen-\ntial energy use of some 60 GJ, but nonetheless only constitutes between \n9% and 24% of the typical 100 GJ/capita western European total urban \nfinal energy use.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_13']The relationship between climate and urban energy use is a two-way \nstreet:  climate  not  only  influences  urban  energy  demand,  but  urban \nareas also influence their local climate through the \u2018urban heat island\u2019 \neffect (see  Section 18.4.2.4 ).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The connection to national energy systems and their dependence on \nthe  resource  base  is  especially  pronounced  for  power  generation, \nsince  cities  often  draw  electricity  from  the  national  grid.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_15']In  some \ncases, urban power plants are designed to use local resources, such \nas hydropower, geothermal, or wastes, but these potential resources \nare usually extremely limited in urban areas and provide only a small \ncontribution to the high energy demand associated with high urban \npopulation  and  income  densities.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']For the household level, correlations between income and \nenergy use have been shown for the Netherlands (Vringer and Blok, 1995), \nIndia  (Pachauri  and  Spreng,   2002 ),  Brazilian  cities  (Cohen  et  al.,   2005 ), \nDenmark (Wier et al.,  2001 ), and Japan (Lenzen et al.,  2006 ), with similar \nresults for GHG emissions in Australia (Dey et al.,  2007 ) and CO 2  emissions \nin the United States (Weber and Matthews,  2008 ).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']( 2004 )  showed  that  urban  household  energy  increases  with  house-\nhold expenditure, and that most of this increase results from the energy \nembodied by goods and services, since direct final energy use, in contrast, \nincreases only slowly with expenditure (albeit from high baseline levels).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_12']Based on a production approach, urban per capita energy use is very \noften lower than nonurban energy use or the national average, particu-\nlarly for

'SDG_11']Summary \n This brief analysis analyzed three ways in which cities can improve the \nefficiency  of  their  energy  systems:  improving  the  quality  of  the  built \nenvironment, increasing the density of the urban layout, and using inte-\ngrated, distributed energy systems, such as CHP.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']A few general conclu-\nsions can be drawn from this case study:\n\n \u2022\n\n \u2022\n\n   Cutting  urban  energy  use  by  half  is  possible  through  integrated \napproaches that address the quality of the built environment (build-\nings efficiency), urban form and density, and urban energy-systems \noptimization (cogeneration).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']\u2022\n\n  Annual  energy-system  costs  (i.e.,  the  costs  of  energy  conversion \nand distribution), but not demand-side measures, such as increased \n\n1378\n\n\x0cChapter 18 \n\nUrban Energy Systems\n\nbuilding  efficiency  or  urban  layout,  are  dominated  by  fuel  costs.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Increased urban density and improved building efficiency deliver primary \nenergy use and carbon-emission savings of about one-third each; dis-\ntributed energy systems provide approximately 10% primary energy and \ncarbon emissions saving.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_9', 'SDG_11']These decisions \u2013 for example, on the building energy-\nperformance standards or on the location of infrastructure \u2013 are difficult \nto change in retrofit and can lead to significant increases in energy use; \nin the cases studied here, urban sprawl led to a one-third increase in pri-\nmary energy use.", u"['SDG_9', 'SDG_11']Efficient distributed-energy systems, to a certain extent, \ncan be retrofitted into existing urban forms, but they too can benefit from \nlong-sighted urban planning by encouraging sufficient demand density \nand by reducing the costs of the network infrastructure.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The above simulations suggest that the effects on energy demand of \nurban form and density, and that of the energy efficiency characteristics \nof technologies, processes, and practices (e.g., buildings) are of compa-\nrable magnitude, i.e., are comparable size

'SDG_11']Existing versus planned layouts \n The problem of planning improved urban energy systems is very differ-\nent for existing and for new urban areas.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_9', 'SDG_11']The advantage of new devel-\nopments (e.g., ecocities and zero-carbon cities planned in places such \nas  China  and  the  Middle  East)  is  that  holistic  planning  tools  can  be \nemployed  to  integrate  the  design  of  the  urban  form,  the  built  envir-\nonment,  the  transportation  infrastructure,  and  the  energy  system.", u"['SDG_9', 'SDG_11']Large-scale upgrades of the built environment have been demonstrated, \n\nfor example in Germany, where new technologies at the building and \nbuilding-cluster level are being employed and new ideas are emerging \nfor new uses of existing infrastructure (e.g., using a natural gas network \nto transmit bioderived gas in cities, see also  Chapter 10 ).", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']Given that all city systems are subject to uncertainty and change, there is \nalso a need for option-based design techniques that allow city growth and \ntechnological evolution and that avoid strongly path-dependent solutions.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Role of real-time systems \n There  is  a  long  history  of  promising  designs  related  to  urban  energy \nsystems  that  have  not  delivered  the  expected  performance.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The \ninteractions between systems and citizens can be augmented through \nreal-time  pricing  of  energy  and  virtual  energy  markets,  real-time  dis-\nplays of household, large building,

Pollution Trends \n\n Energy and air pollution are closely linked because urban outdoor  36   \nair pollution is primarily a result of fuel burning in power generation, \n\n  36   \n\n  Residential energy use, e.g., for cooking, can result in high levels of indoor air pollu-\ntion and result in health impacts (see  Chapters 4  and  19 ).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']From  the  urban  energy-usage  perspective,  the  lit-\nerature shows that high urban density tends to be associated with \nlower per capita energy uses (see  Section 18.5.2 ), which reduces air-\npollution  problems  somewhat.", u"['SDG_11', 'SDG_12']Historically,  the  concentrations  of  pollutants  such  as  SO 2   and TSPs, \nwhich mainly result from industrial production systems were concen-\ntrated  in  cities,  have  declined  in  industrialized  cities.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Currently,  the  SO  x    and TSP  pollutants \nin  industrialized  countries  are  no  longer  an  issue  for  energy  use  in \ncities, because urban energy systems are dominated by electricity or \nother cleaner fuels, and emissions from large point sources are tightly \ncontrolled.", u"['SDG_3', 'SDG_11']PM-10 is one of the key public health issues in the cities of many devel-\noping countries, where their levels are many times higher than the WHO \nor  USEPA.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']This  confirms  that  urban  air-quality  management \nespecially  needs  to  address  transport-related  emissions  from  a  much \nmore systemic perspective, including transport policies that influence the \nurban modal split toward a

strategy.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_11']Despite improvements in both vehicle technology and fuel quality, the \nhigh  growth  rates  in  private  automobile  ownership  and  usage  with \nrising income is proving a challenge to the control PM-10, suspended \nparticulate matter, and NO  x   pollutants in cities of developing countries \n(Dhakal and Schipper,  2005 ).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The key policy challenges for air pollution \nthat have direct bearing on urban energy systems are (adapted from \nSchwela et al.,  2006 ):\n\n \u2022\n\n   Comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of different options \nis  needed  in  cities,  but  requires  adequate  institutional  capacity, \nwhich  remains  comparatively  weak  in  many  large  cities  ( Table \n18.21 ), not to mention

accounting for even \nlarger shares in economic and energy activities.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']Almost all future popu-\nlation  growth  of  some  three  billion  people  to  2050  will  be  absorbed \nby  urban  areas.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']This  urban  growth  is  the  combined  result  of  natural \nincreases in urban populations plus migration from rural to urban areas \nsuch that the increase in rural population in many developing countries \nwill be overshadowed by population flows to the cities.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']Patterns of urban population growth have been and will remain hetero-\ngeneous.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']Most of the growth will continue to occur in small- to medium-\nsized urban centers, which explains the remarkable robustness of the \ndistribution of city-size classes over time and across different regions.", u"['SDG_3', 'SDG_7', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_13']To  harmonize  many  environmental  issues  within  common  policy \nresponses,  estimation  of  the  co-benefits  of  air-pollution  manage-\nment with respect to human health, urban energy system improve-\nment,  energy  security,  climate  change  mitigation,  and  ecosystems \nin  general  is  essential.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']1385\n\n\x0cUrban Energy Systems \n\n  18.6.2   \n\n  Urban Energy Use \n\n The urban share in current world-energy use varies as a function of sys-\ntem boundaries in terms of spatial scales (cities versus agglomerations), \nenergy-systems  definition  (final  commercial,  total  final,  and  total  pri-\nmary energy), and the boundary drawn to account for embodied energy \nin a city\u2019s goods and services, both imported and exported.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The direct \ntransfer of national energy (or GHG emissions) reporting formats to the \nurban scale is often referred to as a \u2018production\u2019 approach, and con-\ntrasts  to  a \u2018consumption\u2019  accounting  approach  that  pro-rates  associ-\nated energy uses (or GHG emissions) per unit of expenditure of urban \nconsumer expenditures, thus accounting for energy uses irrespective of \ntheir form (direct or embodied energy) or location (within or outside a \ncity\u2019s administrative boundary).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']To ensure reproduci-\nbility, this assessment also recommends explicitly that no urban GHG-\nemission  inventory  be  published  without  the  underlying  energy  data \nused in the assessment.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_12']Available estimates of current urban energy use based on a production \napproach (direct final energy use, or primary energy use, i.e., including \npro-rated upstream energy sector conversion losses) suggest that urban \nenergy use accounts for between 60% and 80% of global energy use.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Total  energy  use  is  therefore  already  predominantly  urban.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Mirroring \nthe growing importance of urban areas in demographic and economic \ndevelopment, urban energy use will continue to grow further as a frac-\ntion of total global energy needs.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']This implies that energy sustainability \nchallenges need to be addressed and solved primarily by action in urban \nsettings.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']There is great heterogeneity in urban energy-use patterns, especially \nwhen manufacturing and transport energy uses are included.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']In many \ndeveloping countries, urban dwellers use substantially  more  energy than \ntheir rural compatriots, which primarily reflects higher urban incomes.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_9', 'SDG_11']Conversely,  in  many  industrialized  countries  per  capita  urban  final \nenergy use (i.e., based on a production-accounting approach) is often \nsubstantially  lower  than the national average, which reflects the effects \nof compact urban form, settlement types (multi- versus single-family \ndwellings)  and  availability  and/or  practicability  of  public  transport \ninfrastructure systems compared with those in the suburban or rural \nsprawl.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The few available data, however, suggest that urban energy use \nin  high-income  countries  is  not  substantially  different  from  national \naverages  using  a  consumption-based  accounting  approach  that  also \nincludes energy embodied in imports.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']So, the effects of lowered direct \n\n1386\n\nChapter 18\n\nfinal energy use through a more service-oriented urban economy, urban \nform and density, and resulting lower transport energy use are largely \ncompensated by higher embodied energy use associated with higher \nurban  incomes  in  high-income  countries.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']However, \nit is highly likely that, because of the much higher income differential \nbetween  urban  and  rural  populations  in  low-income  countries,  their \nurban energy use is significantly higher on a per capita basis compared \nto national averages in a consumption-based accounting framework as \nwell.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_11']Levels and structure (access to electricity, clean fuels for house-\nholds, private motorized transport) of urban energy use in low-income \ncountries are therefore a powerful leading indicator of future devel-\nopments to come with rising urbanization and income growth in the \ndeveloping world.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_13']Drivers of urban energy use include geography and climate, resource \navailability,  socioeconomic  characteristics,  degree  of  integration  into \nthe  national  and  global  economy  (imports/exports),  and  urban  form \nand density.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Priorities for urban energy and sustainability policies, \ntherefore, should focus where local decision making and funding also \nprovides the largest leverage effects: urban form and density (which are \nimportant macrodeterminants of urban structures, activity patterns, and \nhence energy use), the quality of the built environment (energy-efficient \nbuildings in particular), urban transport policy (particularly the promo-\ntion  of  energy  efficient  and  \u2018eco\u2019-friendly  public  transport  and  non-\nmotorized mobility options), and improvements in urban energy systems \nthrough cogeneration or waste-heat recycling schemes, where feasible.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Local action, however, also requires local capacities and responsibilities \nin  addressing  urban  energy  and  environmental  problems,  including  a \nmediating role among the multiple stakeholders characteristic of decen-\ntralized urban decision making.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Conversely, the promotion of local solar or wind renewables will, at \nbest, have a marginal impact on the overall energy use of larger cities \n(typically <1%)  39   because of the significant energy-density mismatch \nbetween (high) urban energy use and (low) renewable energy flows \nper unit land area available in urban areas.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Smaller cities, however, \ncould provide more avenues to integrate renewable energy into urban \nenergy  systems  than  large  cities.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_13']Nonetheless, urban energy and climate policy should recognize that the \nmost productive local decisions and policies influence the  efficiency  of \nurban energy use that is the demand side of the energy system, rather \nthan its supply side.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']39   \n\n  Important exceptions include utilization of urban wastes and, where available, geo-\nthermal resources, both of which are characterized by a high energy density.", u"['SDG_3', 'SDG_11']In many low-income nations, more than half the urban \npopulation still rely on charcoal, fuelwood, straw, dung, or wastes for \ncooking, with significant adverse consequences for human health and \nurban air quality.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']The  constraints  on  supporting  the  shift  to  clean  fuels  and  providing \nall urban households with electricity are less to do with energy pol-\nicy than with authorities\u2019 handling of issues of informal settlements.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']It is mostly in nations where this antagonistic \nrelationship between local government and the inhabitants of such set-\ntlements has changed, through widespread public support to upgrade \n\u2018slums\u2019 and squatters, that clean energy and electricity reaches urban \npoor groups.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_9', 'SDG_11']Housing, infrastructure, energy, and transport services are the key sus-\ntainability  challenges  to  accommodate  some  three  billion  additional \nurban dwellers in the decades to come, especially in low-income coun-\ntries.", u"['SDG_9', 'SDG_11']Informal settlements will be one of the transitional forms of settle-\nment for many of these new urban dwellers and will require a much \nmore proactive, anticipatory policy approach, especially with respect to \nthe location of informal settlements and subsequent infrastructure con-\nnections and upgrading programs.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Urban  density  and  form  are  not  only  important  determinants  for  the \nfunctionality and quality of life in cities, but also for their energy use.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']Nonetheless,  empirical  data  strongly  suggest  that  the   net  balance   of \nthese positive and negative agglomeration externalities remained sta-\nble for extended periods of time, as illustrated by the remarkable sta-\nbility of the rank-size distribution of cities (with dominating positive or \nnegative net agglomeration externalities the growth of the  ensemble   40   \nof larger cities should be above or below that of smaller cities, which is \nnot the case).", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']The historical evolutionary processes that govern urban \ngrowth have played out differently over time and space, which results \nin   path  dependency .", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Cities  that  evolved  along  alternative  pathways \nhave  alternative  density  levels  from  high-density  \u2018Asian\u2019  (e.g., Tokyo, \nShanghai, Mumbai) and \u2018old European\u2019 (e.g., London, Madrid, Warsaw) \nto  low  density  \u2018new  frontier\u2019  (e.g.,  Los Angeles,  Brasilia,  Melbourne) \npathways, each of which have different structural options available to \nimprove energy efficiency and optimize urban energy and transport sys-\ntems in terms of sustainability criteria.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']First, \nthe implications of urban density on the requirements of urban energy \nsystems are that they need to be basically  pollution free , as otherwise \neven relatively clean energy forms can quickly overwhelm the assimila-\ntive capacity of urban environments.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']Thus, in \n\n  40   \n\n  Evidently,  individual  cities can forge ahead or fall behind the overall distributional \npattern of aggregate uniform urban growth rates as outlined by the rank-size rule.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']1387\n\n\x0cUrban Energy Systems \n\nChapter 18\n\nthe long-term all end-use energy fuels consumed in urban areas need \nto  be  of  zero-emission  quality,  as  exemplified  by  electricity  or  (even-\ntually) hydrogen, with natural gas as the transitional fuel of choice in \nurban areas.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']This \u2018zero-emission\u2019 requirement for urban energy transcends the \ncustomary sustainability divide between fossil and renewable energies, \nas even \u2018carbon-neutral\u2019 biofuels when used by millions of automobiles \nin an urban environment will produce unacceptable levels of NO  x   or O 3  \npollution.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Zoning and parking \nregulation, combined with public transport policies and policies that \npromote non-motorized transport modes and walkability thus consti-\ntute the essential \u2018building blocks\u2019 of urban energy efficiency and sus-\ntainability \u2018policy packages.\u2019  \n\n  18.6.3.3   \n\n  Mobile Cities: Urban Transport \n\n Urban transport is a key policy concern, both for its high visibility (poten-\ntial opposition to \u2018top-down\u2019 policies) and its crucial importance to the \nvery functionality of cities.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']A new public policy para-\ndigm for urban transport needs to break this cycle of rebound effects \nthrough integrated urban energy transport policies that deal with both \ndemand and supply.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']Attractive public transport systems require a dense public transport net-\nwork and a high service frequency with short intervals, which are only \n\n1388\n\n\x0cChapter 18 \n\nUrban Energy Systems\n\nfeasible with a minimum threshold of urban density.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']BRT systems are, therefore, a much more attract-\nive  option  for  many  cities  in  low-income  countries  than  are  capital-\nintensive subway systems, even though, in the long term, the latter offer \nthe possibility of higher passenger fluxes and greater energy efficiency.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_12', 'SDG_13']18.6.3.4   \n\n  Ef\ufb01 cient Cities: Doing More with Less Energy \n\n From all the major determinants of urban energy use \u2013 climate, inte-\ngration into the global economy, consumption patterns, quality of built \nenvironment,  urban  form  and  density  (including  transport  systems), \nand urban energy systems and their integration \u2013 only the final three \nare amenable to an urban policymaking context and therefore should \nreceive priority.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Systemic  characteristics of urban energy use are generally more import-\nant  determinants  of  the  efficiency  of  urban  energy  use  than  those  of \nindividual consumers or of technological artifacts.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']For instance, the share \nof high occupancy public and/or non-motorized transport modes in urban \nmobility is a more important determinant of urban transport energy use \nthan the efficiency of the urban vehicle fleet (be it buses or hybrid auto-\nmobiles).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Evidently, \nurban policies need to address both systemic and individual character-\nistics in urban energy use, but their different long-term leverage effects \nshould structure policy attention and perseverance.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Locally harvested  renewables can, \nat best, provide 1% of the energy needs of a megacity and a few per-\ncentage points in smaller, low-density cities because of the mismatch \nbetween  (high)  urban  energy  demand  and  (low)  renewable  energy \nsupply densities.", u"['SDG_6', 'SDG_11']Without ambitious efficiency gains, the corresponding \n\u2018energy footprint\u2019 of cities that import large-scale, centralized renew-\nable energies (biofuels for electricity) will be vast and at risk of produ-\ncing \u2018collateral\u2019 damages caused by large-scale land conversions (e.g., \nsoil carbon perturbations and albedo changes), and competition over \nfood and water.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']Given that all city systems are subject to uncertainty \nand change, there is also a need for option-based design techniques \nthat allow for city growth and technological evolution, and that avoid \nstrongly  path-dependent  solutions  and  \u2018lock-in\u2019  into  urban  energy-\nsupply systems based on current- or near-term renewable options that, \nultimately, will be superseded by third and fourth generation renew-\nable  supply  technology  systems.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Finally,  energy security  is a re-emerging issue for many cities because \nenergy security declined over recent decades and security concerns need \nto be integrated increasingly into urban energy policies and sustainabil-\nity  transition  analysis.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Better  efficiency  and  improved  energy  systems \nintegration will also benefit urban energy security, although a further \nassessment of energy security is beyond the scope of this urbanization \nchapter (as dealt with in the energy security  Chapter 5 ).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']18.6.3.5   \n\n  Clean Cities: Air Pollution \n\n In terms of urban energy-demand management, the quality of the built \nenvironment  (buildings  efficiency)  and  urban  form  and  density  that, \nto a large degree, structure urban transport energy use are roughly of \nequal importance.", u"['SDG_9', 'SDG_11']To a degree, the observed significant improvements in urban air qual-\nity caused by the elimination of traditional air pollutants, such as soot, \nparticles, and SO 2 , in cities of high-income countries are a powerful illus-\ntration that cities act as innovation centers and hubs for environmental \nimprovements that lead to a sustainability transition path.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']An  import-\nant feature of these regulatory or market-based approaches is  dynamic \ntarget  setting   to  reflect  changing  technology  options  and  to  counter \nthe consequences of urban growth and potential consumer \u2018take-back\u2019 \neffects.", u"['SDG_3', 'SDG_11']Air  pollution  is  also  the  area  of  urban  environmental  policy  mak-\ning  where  the  most  significant  co-benefits  of  policies  can  be  real-\nized: improving access to clean cooking fuels, for example, improves \nhuman  health  and  lowers  traditional  pollutant  emissions,  and  also \nhas (through reduced black carbon emissions) net global warming co-\nbenefits.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Similarly, improved energy efficiency and public transport options (e.g., \nNew Delhi\u2019s transition to CNG buses) can also yield co-benefits on a \nvariety of fronts (lower energy and transport costs for the poor, cleaner \nair, improved urban functionality) and should therefore be higher on \nthe  policy  agenda  than  more  single-purpose  policy  measures  (e.g., \nrenewable portfolio standards for urban electricity supply).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Realization of the significant potential co-benefits, however, requires \nmore holistic policy approaches that integrate urban land-use, trans-\nport, and energy policies with the more traditional air-pollution policy \nframeworks.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']A renewed effort to improve measurement and monitor-\ning as well as planning and modeling of urban environmental quality, \nwith a particular focus on urban energy and urban transport policy, is \nurgently  needed.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Examples  include  preventing  the  further  development  of  low-density, \nsuburban  housing  and  of  shopping  malls,  or  promotion  of  the  co-\nlocation of high energy supply and demand centers within a city that \nenable  cogeneration  and  waste-heat  recycling  for  heating  and  cool-\ning purposes (e.g., in business districts).", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']Buildings energy-performance \nstandards are also a prime example of policy interventions that need to \nbe implemented as early as possible to reap long-term benefits in terms

poor practices in urban planning and design, inadequate \nland management and administration, poor physical and social \ninfrastructure, and the lack of equitable distribution of resources \nand redistributive policies.", u"['SDG_5', 'SDG_11']This is indeed a challenge, and the more reason why gender \nand the prosperity of cities need to be addressed by all concerned.", u"['SDG_1', 'SDG_5', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_11']Women migrate from rural to urban areas \nmainly in search of employment, and, in order to escape from \npoverty, gender-based violence, gender discrimination and \ndisinheritance.", u"['SDG_5', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_11']The UN-Habitat gender study of 2012 shows that, first, \n\nurbanisation is largely associated with the prosperity of women in \ntheory, but in practice few women actually benefit from economic \ngrowth and prosperity of cities.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']Third, the study highlights the promotion of entrepreneurship \nand the need to create productive employment opportunities as \nkey policy actions required in order to enhance prosperity for \nwomen in cities.", u"['SDG_5', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_9', 'SDG_11']Fourth, the study affirms the need for increased \ninvestment in infrastructure development in order to lessen the \nreproductive work and time burdens on women, and to make \nurban planning and design more gender responsive, not only for \nthe good of women, but to enhance prosperity for all.", u"['SDG_5', 'SDG_11']The time is now ripe for cities and local governments to put in \nplace gender equality policies, strategies and programmes which

in the prosperity of cities, the State of \n\nPatterns of urbanisation and urban prosperity vary widely \n\nacross developing regions.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']Although cities \nproduce the major share of regional Gross Domestic Product \n(GDP), rates of slum growth are virtually parallel with those for \nurban areas as a whole.", u"['SDG_5', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_11']This \nundermines the common hypothesis that urbanisation and \neconomic growth are good for women and suggests that in \norder for urban prosperity to reach women, more efforts to \nadvance gender equality are required.", u"['SDG_1', 'SDG_11']Nonetheless, \nbroadening analysis away from the routine focus on women\u2019s \npoverty in cities, to their shares of prosperity offers an \nunexpected advantage insofar as it draws attention to a major \nhiatus between gendered inputs and gendered outcomes in \nurban contexts.", u"['SDG_5', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_11']This is evidenced in notable \ngender gaps in labour and employment, \u2018decent work\u2019, pay, \ntenure rights, access to, and accumulation of assets, personal \nsecurity and safety, and representation in formal structures of \nurban governance.", u"['SDG_5', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_11']Reaping the benefits of \nurban prosperity should be a right for all women and men, with \nthe added spin-off that greater social, economic and political \nequality within cities is good for growth and sustainability.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']It is therefore essential to identify not only the \nexperiences of poor women living in cities, but also the young, \nthe elderly, the married, the single, the rich, the professional, \nthose from different ethnic groups, sexual orientation and \nemployment status not to mention spatial location in the \ncity, particularly with reference to slum and non-slum areas.1 \nAlthough the focus in this report is on women, reference is \nmade to men where relevant reflecting a \u2018relational\u2019 approach \nthat emphasises the dynamic interactions and negotiations \naround power that underpin women and men\u2019s identities and \nroles.2\n\nViii\n\nSTATE OF WOMEN IN CITIES 2012-2013Woman walking in city.", u"['SDG_5',

2012/13 focusing on gender in the prosperity of cities.", u"['SDG_5', 'SDG_11']\u2018Prosperity\u2019 is invariably a positive term, implying \u201csuccess, \nwealth, thriving conditions, wellbeing or good fortune\u201d.3 \nHowever, it also needs to encompass equity, equality and \nparticipation and therefore the gendered dimensions of cities.", u"['SDG_5', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_16']The State of Women in Cities 2012/13 builds upon a growing \n\nbody of gender-aware research and advocacy on the part of \nUN-Habitat,4 including calls to make cities \u2018smarter\u2019 through \npromoting gender equality and its 2008-2013 Gender Equality \nAction Plan.5 Such initiatives complement broader policy \nagendas for gender-equitable development which have been \nadvanced by major organisations within the UN system, \nbilateral institutions, national governments, international and \nnational NGOs, and grassroots women\u2019s movements since \nthe UN Decade for Women (1975-1985),6 as well as aiming \nto progress the attainment of the Millennium Development \nGoals.7\n\nThe report not only draws on a wide range of academic \n\nresearch, official documentation and statistical data, but also \non a UN-Habitat\u2019s survey of five cities namely Bangalore \n(India), Johannesburg (South Africa), Kampala (Uganda), \n\nKingston (Jamaica) and Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) with a total \nof 691 policy-makers, non-government officials, business \npeople and academics working in the field of urban and gender \ndevelopment, as well as informal city dwellers (the former \nconstituted 55 per cent across all cities with a high of 83 per \ncent in Kampala and a low of 18 per cent in Kingston).8 It dealt \nwith perceptions of issues related to urban prosperity in relation \nto providing all its citizens with \u2018quality of life\u2019, \u2018productivity\u2019, \n\u2018infrastructure\u2019 and \u2018equity.", u"['SDG_5', 'SDG_11']Chapter 1.1 outlines the conceptual framework \nfor

gender and the quality of life in the prosperity \nof cities; Chapter 2.2 addresses the gendered nature of \ninfrastructure; Chapter 2.3 deals with gender, productivity \nand employment; and Chapter 2.4 discusses prosperity and \nequity-based gender development.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']Cities of women, of older women, of female-\n\nheaded households\n\nWith just over half of the world\u2019s

'SDG_11']Spatial inequality: two-thirds think that 50 per \n\ncent of women have no access to secure housing\n\nIn the context of the fact that 40 per cent felt that their \n\ncity was \u2018not fully committed\u2019 to promoting quality of life for \nwomen, 64 per cent of people across all cities, except Kampala, \nfelt that 50 per cent or more women had no access to secure \nhousing.", u"['SDG_5', 'SDG_11']Only 28 per cent in all cities thought that existing \nefforts to attain gender equity in access to housing tenure were \n\u2018advanced\u2019 or \u2018very advanced\u2019.", u"['SDG_6', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_9', 'SDG_11']5.  women need more equitable access to \n\ninfrastructure, especially sanitation\n\nAlthough over half (53 per cent) of the survey respondents \n\nthought that their cities were \u2018committed\u2019 in some form to \npromoting infrastructural development to fully engage women \nin urban development and productive work, only 22 per cent \nstated that they were \u2018fully committed\u2019 or \u2018committed\u2019, with \na high of 39 per cent in Johannesburg.", u"['SDG_6', 'SDG_11']50 per cent stated \nthat sanitation and the burden of disease acted as barriers to the \nprosperity of women in cities.", u"['SDG_1', 'SDG_3', 'SDG_5', 'SDG_6', 'SDG_11']10.  women residing in slums require special \n\nattention \n\nAlthough women in slum and non-slum areas of cities \n\nexperience a similar range of challenges in relation to gender \ninequalities, the greater concentration of poverty in slum \nsettlements aggravated by overcrowding, insecurity, lack of \naccess to security of tenure, water and sanitation, as well as \nlack of access to transport, and sexual and reproductive health \nservices, often creates more difficult conditions for women in \ntrying to achieve prosperity.", u"['SDG_5', 'SDG_11']Gender equitable cities reward women and \n\ngenerate prosperity; but more dedicated gender \npolicies needed in cities\n\nWhile more than half of respondents (54 per cent) felt that \n\nthere was some form of commitment to the equal participation \nof all women in social, economic, political and cultural spheres, \nonly 23.5 per cent thought that their city was \u2018committed\u2019 or \n\u2018fully committed\u2019.", u"['SDG_5', 'SDG_11']Less than half of urban \ndwellers stated that their city had a dedicated gender policy (47 \nper cent).", u"['SDG_5', 'SDG_11']However, almost half (46 per cent) stated that their \ncity had a policy that successfully contributed to gender equity.", u"['SDG_5', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_11']The actual

quality of \nthe environment\n\nEveryone should have rights to the city\n\nAwareness of the negative dimensions of urban growth and \n\nrecognition that prosperity does not automatically reduce \npoverty or inequality has generated new ideas about urban \nmanagement.", u"['SDG_1', 'SDG_5', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_9', 'SDG_11']These acknowledge that prioritising social and \nenvironmental issues and employment generation is best \nfor growth, as proposed in \u2018smart growth\u2019 9 or \u2018smart cities\u2019 \napproaches.10 Fostering the links between infrastructure and \nhuman capital investment in \u2018smarter\u2019 more democratic and \nsocially just ways is more likely to make cities prosperous, but \nalso sustainable.11\n\nAs part of this, everyone should have \u2018rights\u2019 to the city.12 \nThis shift towards greater social inclusivity and equality also \nmeans that a \u2018prosperous city\u2019 is a space where women and \nmen should enjoy equal rights and opportunities.13 Therefore, \nas more inclusive cities are good for growth, gender equality \ncan make cities \u2018smarter\u2019 still with gender-aware and fair \u2018smart \ngrowth\u2019 also demanding \u2018smart management\u2019.14\n\nThis also has wider implications for development processes \n\nas outlined in the World Bank\u2019s World Development Report \n2012: Gender Equality and Development which notes: \u2018Gender \nequality matters \u2026 as an instrument for development\u2019.15 This \n\u2018smart economics\u2019 approach argues that economic growth \ncan be positively linked with providing greater opportunities \nfor levelling the playing field between women and men.16 As \nsuch, it is suggested that: \u2018The general view is that economic \ndevelopment

can \nexacerbate and perpetuate poverty.", u"['SDG_3', 'SDG_6', 'SDG_9', 'SDG_11']The urban poor also face many practical and health problems \ndue to lack of adequate sanitation and services.21 Many of these \nconditions affect women most because they undertake unpaid \ncaring and social reproductive activities such as childcare, \ncaring for the sick, disabled and elderly, washing, cleaning and \ncommunity organising, as well as building and consolidating \nhousing and providing basic services and infrastructure.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']All \nthese activities allow the urban economy to

paid \nwork.", u"['SDG_3', 'SDG_4', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_11']As such, \u2018women are a city\u2019s greatest asset, \nand contribute heavily to sustainable urban development\u2019.23\n\nFourth, women are invariably disadvantaged compared with \nmen in cities in terms of equal access to employment, housing, \nhealth and education, asset ownership, experiences of urban \nviolence, and ability to

cities in which they reside.", u"['SDG_5', 'SDG_11']In order to consider these issues more systematically, the \nreport now turns to the conceptual framework that has been \ndeveloped to understand urban prosperity and gender.", u"['SDG_1', 'SDG_5', 'SDG_11']URBAN PROSPERITy, GENDER AND \nEMPOwERMENT NExUS\n\nConceptualising gendered poverty and empowerment\n\nDespite considerable theoretical advances in understanding \n\ngendered poverty and a long-standing recognition of the \nneed to \u2018en-gender\u2019 urban analysis and policy, the field of \nconceptualising gender in relation to urban prosperity is much \nless established.24 This is possibly because women are more \noften the \u2018losers\u2019 rather than \u2018winners\u2019 in urban environments, \nas they are in societies more generally.", u"['SDG_1', 'SDG_11']This has entailed important critiques of the notion \nof a \u2018feminisation of poverty, particularly the  argument that \nmost of the world\u2019s poor are women and that women\u2019s poverty \nis increasing which is linked with a rise in female headed \nhouseholds, especially in cities.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']Female heads are not only likely \nto continue to have disproportionate responsibility for unpaid \nand care work, which are especially onerous in urban contexts \ncharacterised by limited access to basic services and difficult \nenvironmental circumstances, but tend also to have to  engage \nin paid work too.25\n\nBy the same token, \u2018double burdens\u2019 of labour are \n\nincreasingly affecting all women and has led scholars like \nSylvia Chant to advance an alternative formulation of the \n\u2018feminisation of poverty\u2019 under the rubric of a \u2018feminisation of \nresponsibility and/or obligation\u2019.", u"['SDG_1', 'SDG_5', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_11']This stresses the importance \nof labour, time and assets and the fact that privation is not \nassociated with female household headship alone.26 In addition, \nexamining the relationship between gender and poverty requires \nanalysis of labour markets, households and states in a holistic \nway.27\n\nAnother important factor in conceptualising gender and the \nprosperity of cities has been work on women\u2019s empowerment \nand especially their economic empowerment.", u"['SDG_5', 'SDG_11']These include the International \nCenter for Research on Women (ICRW) definition that refers \nto woman\u2019s ability to succeed and advance economically and \nthe power to make and act on economic decisions,34 and UN \nWomen\u2019s framework which focuses on

on the gap between \nwomen\u2019s inputs to and outcomes from the wealth-generating \npossibilities of cities and the implications of these processes for \nwomen\u2019s economic empowerment\n\nConceptualising the gendered nature of urban prosperity \ntherefore involves interactions across a range of spheres and \nprocesses in cities.", u"['SDG_5', 'SDG_11']Sylvia Chant (2011b; 2013) has developed \na framework for analysing these issues identifying the critical \nelements in conceptualising gender and the prosperity of cities.", u"['SDG_5', 'SDG_11']These revolve around the following: \ngender and urban demographics, gender divisions of labour in \nthe urban economy, gender disparities in human capital; gender \ngaps in physical and financial capital/assets, gender disparities \nin space, mobility and connectivity, and gender disparities in \npower and rights (Figure 1.1.2).", u"['SDG_3', 'SDG_5', 'SDG_11']These disparities are rooted in a range of

prosperity.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']Feminised urban sex \nratios reflect the cumulative gender-selectivity of rural-urban \nmigration, with Latin America standing out as a region in \nwhich more women than men have moved to towns and cities \nover the past several decades, along with some countries in \nSoutheast Asia such as Thailand and Viet Nam.39\n\nTraditionally lower levels of female rural-urban migration \nin sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia have been explained \nby factors such as socio-cultural restrictions on independent \nfemale movement, virilocal marriage (where a married couple \nreside with the husband\u2019s parents), and the encouragement of \nyoung men to gain experience in the city as a form of masculine \n\u2018rite of passage\u2019.40 Also important has been the comparative \nlack of employment opportunities for women in towns and \ncities.", u"['SDG_1', 'SDG_11']Given a common \nassociation between advanced age and poverty, especially \n\n10\n\nSTATE OF

earnings, \nlessened entanglement in and control by patriarchal kinship \nsystems, and higher levels of urban female land and property \nownership.44\nGendered divisions of labour in the urban economy\n\nThe health of urban economies owes as much to the unpaid \n\u2018reproductive\u2019 labour that fall disproportionately on women\u2019s \nshoulders at household and community levels as to the more \nvalued remunerated work where men\u2019s labour is concentrated \nand which is registered in GDP and in the System of National \nAccounts (SNA).45 Although women across developing regions \nare increasingly engaging in paid as well as unpaid activities, \nthis has not been matched by an increase in domestic labour \nand unpaid care work among men.46 These inequities add-\nup to a female-biased reproduction tax47 which undermines \nwomen\u2019s productivity gains and their prospects of benefitting \nfrom and contributing to urban prosperity.", u"['SDG_3', 'SDG_5', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_10', 'SDG_11']They are also of a smaller, less capitalised scale \nthan men\u2019s income-generating ventures and almost always with \nlower remuneration.49  There is also widespread \u2018segmentation \nby sex\u2019 within urban labour markets associated with wage gaps \nand other forms of inequality such as uneven access to health \ninsurance and pensions which are determined by a combination \nof social and gender norms and market forces.50\n\nAnother important consideration in analysing gender \nand urban prosperity from the perspective of labour and \nproductivity relates to the inter-generational effects of \nwomen\u2019s increasing involvement in remunerated work.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']It is \nthe type of work that is significant in terms of empowerment \nrather than labour force involvement in itself, as well as a \ncommensurate redistribution of unpaid reproductive labour to \nmen at the household level.52\n\n11\n\nGENDER AND THE PROSPERITY OF

general capacities, their self-esteem and their \nability to exert agency.54 Educated women, on average, delay \nmarriage and childbirth, are less vulnerable to HIV/AIDS, \nenjoy more power in their homes and in public arenas, and \nhave fewer children who also tend to be healthier and better \neducated.55 Therefore, the accumulation of human capital is \nessential for ensuring women\u2019s

'SDG_11']Issues \nof access to and provision of quality and affordable public \ntransport are also crucial in determining women\u2019s movement \nwithin cities.65\n\nIt is also critical to note that even in the new \u2018digital age\u2019 \n\nwhere technology has the potential to diminish the constraints \nposed by physical limitations, women\u2019s connectivity with \nothers is commonly hampered by a gendered \u2018digital divide\u2019.66 \nHowever, while women\u2019s access to computing skills and \nequipment and to internet access is much more limited than \nmen\u2019s, gender gaps are much less marked for more simple \ndigital technology such as mobile phones.67 Mobile phones \nmay be used by families concerned for the safety of daughters \nworking night shifts in India\u2019s urban call centres, for example.68 \nDigital connectivity also provides for easing rural-urban \nlinkages by introducing changing perceptions of distance \nand permitting more frequent personal contact and

of conceptualising the \n\ninterrelationships between gender and urban prosperity \nrelates to gender differences in power and rights.", u"['SDG_5', 'SDG_11']Although there is evidence of increased

\n\nfare worse in terms of physical and mental ill-health alike \nthan non-slum residents linked with inadequate public \nhealthcare and problems of spatial inaccessibility, as well as by \ninability to afford costly private alternatives.30 In turn, most \ndeveloping countries now face a \u2018double disease burden\u2019 of \nnon-communicable and communicable disease.31 Research \nbased on India\u2019s 2005-6 National Family Health Survey \n(NFHS-3) in the context of eight large Indian cities \u2013 Chennai, \nDelhi, Hyderabad, Indore, Meerut, Mumbai and Nagpur \n-  revealed that slum dwellers suffer a disproportionate risk of \n\n29\n\nGENDER AND THE PROSPERITY OF CITIES\x0ccommunicable illness such as tuberculosis.", u"['SDG_1', 'SDG_3', 'SDG_4', 'SDG_11']This has \u2018devastating effects\u2019 for people living in \npoverty in terms of diverting income from food expenditure \nand exacerbating the risks of respiratory disease commonly \nassociated with overcrowded and poorly-ventilated dwellings.33\n\nUnfavourable health conditions in slums have led to the \n\nnotion of an \u2018urban penalty\u2019 in health.34 This suggests that even \nif conditions tend to be better than in rural areas, the \u2018urban \nadvantage\u2019 in respect of lower mortality rates and nutritional \nstatus for children in particular disappears once wealth, \neducation and other socio-economic indicators are controlled \nfor.35 \n\nFor women in slums, the urban penalty is arguably greater \nthan for men as the risks to physical and mental well-being \nare sharpened by a range of \u2018stressors\u2019 attached to their inputs \n\nto household reproduction in challenging circumstances.36   \nFor example, the use in cooking of solid fuels such as \nbiomass (wood and crop residues), coal and charcoal, are far \nmore harmful to individuals through lung and atmosphere \npolluting hydrocarbons, and carcinogens than \u2018cleaner\u2019 more \nexpensive alternatives such as kerosene, liquid petroleum, \ngas and electricity.", u"['SDG_3', 'SDG_5', 'SDG_6', 'SDG_11']In terms \nof mental health, at a global level, depression has been found \nto disproportionately affect women and the poor.39 Recent \nevidence from Cape Town, South Africa demonstrates a higher \nprevalence of Common Mental Disorders (CMDs) in peri-\nurban slums (35 per cent) compared with rural areas (27 per \ncent), and that gender (being female), unemployment and \nsubstance abuse are the most common correlates.40 In such \ncircumstances, basic upgrading of urban slums can have major \npositive effects on women\u2019s general health as in the award-\nwinning multi-stakeholder Ahmedabad Slum Networking \nProgramme in India (See also Box 2.1.3 on Agra).41

needs because of \ntheir economic, social or cultural status, ethnic origins, gender \nor  age.", u"['SDG_9', 'SDG_11']In contrast, other areas are \ncharacterized  by  severe  deprivation,  inadequate  housing, \ndeficient services, poor recreation and cultural facilities, urban \ndecay, and scarce capital investment in public infrastructure.", u"['SDG_5', 'SDG_11']Based not only \non moral and ethical arguments but also practical access to \nopportunity, the concept of an \u201cinclusive city\u201d, or \u201ca city for \nall\u201d, encompasses the social and economic benefits of greater \nequality, promoting positive outcomes for each and every in-\ndividual in society.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']According to current projections, virtually the whole of \nthe world\u2019s population growth over the next 30 years will be \nconcentrated in urban areas.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_12']It is also generally positive, as it brings a number of \nfundamental changes, namely: (a) in the employment sector, \nfrom agriculture-based activities to mass production and service \nindustries; (b) in societal values and modes of governance; (c) \nin the configuration and functionality of human settlements; \n(d) in the spatial scale, density and activities of cities; (e) in \nthe composition of social, cultural and ethnic groups; and (f) \nin  the  extension  of  democratic  rights,  particularly  women\u2019s \nempowerment.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']The rationale is to promote regional economic development growth, \nas well as to anticipate and manage the negative consequences of \nurban/regional growth, such as asymmetrical regional and urban \ndevelopment that has the potential to compound the urban divide.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']The  clustering  of \ncities  into  mega-regions,  urban  corridors  and  city-regions \noperating  as  single  economic  entities  sets  in  motion  self-\nreinforcing,  cumulative  growth  patterns  that  are  making  a \nsignificant  contribution  to  the  world\u2019s  economic  activity.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_9', 'SDG_11']High urban densities reduce transaction costs, make public \nspending  on  infrastructure  and  services  more  economically \nviable, and facilitate generation and diffusion of knowledge, \nall of which are important for growth.", u"['SDG_1', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_11']Hand in hand with \neconomic  growth,  urbanization  has  helped  reduce  overall \npoverty by providing new opportunities, raising incomes and \nincreasing the numbers of livelihood options for both rural \nand urban populations.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']Economic growth can turn urban centres \ninto  effective  \u201cpoverty  fighters\u201d  if  benefits  and  opportunities \nare  redistributed  through  adequate  policies.", u"['SDG_1', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_11']Above  all,  urban  growth  has  been  strongly \nassociated  with  poverty  and  slum  growth.", u"['SDG_6', 'SDG_11']However, \n\nliving \n\nthat \n\nThe  fact  that  an  additional  227  million  urban  dwellers \nhave  gained  access  to  improved  water  and  sanitation  as \nwell  as  to  durable  and  less  crowded  housing  shows  that \na  number  of  countries  and  cities  are  taking  the  slum \ntarget  seriously.", u"['SDG_1', 'SDG_11']This  enhances  the  prospects  for  millions \nof  people  to  escape  poverty,  disease  and  illiteracy,  and \nto  lead  better  lives  thanks  to  a  narrower  urban  divide.", u"['SDG_1', 'SDG_11']Those  governments  that  are  falling  behind  in \nslum  reduction  must  bring  radical  changes  to  their  attitudes \nand  policies  vis-\xe0-vis  slums  and  urban  poverty  at  large.", u"['SDG_1', 'SDG_11']Finally, efforts are also required in those \ncities which, although they are doing relatively well, still feature \nlarge pockets of poverty where people remain marginalized.", u"['SDG_11', 'SDG_16']Only  through  explicit  and  deliberately  inclusive  processes  will \nit be possible to identify the locally appropriate, innovative and \nhigh-leverage  actions  and  policies  which  government,  public \nofficials and major institutions can deploy to set in motion self-\nreinforcing processes that will bridge the urban divide.", u"['SDG_10', 'SDG_11']These \nvalues are comparable to the average Gini coefficients of cities \nin selected Latin American countries, where income inequality \nis particularly steep.", u"['SDG_10', 'SDG_11']In  general,  urban  inequality  in  Latin  America  and  the \nCaribbean  is  declining,  although  it  remains  quite  high.", u"['SDG_1', 'SDG_11']The region\u2019s urban areas, in \nsub-Saharan  Africa  in  particular,  retain  the  highest  degrees \nof poverty in the world, together with the highest prevalence \nof slum populations in urban areas.", u"['SDG_1', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_12']In African urban areas, \nprogress  in  poverty  reduction  has  been  rather  slow  overall, \nbut  these  mixed  results  in  the  distribution  of  income  and \nconsumption point to the hope of future improvements.", u"['SDG_10', 'SDG_11']Asian  cities  (30)  feature  a  comparatively \nlow  degree  of  income  inequality,  as  measured  by  a  Gini \ncoefficient of 0.384.", u"['SDG_5', 'SDG_11']Eastern Europe (8) and CIS cities (10) \nfeature the lowest average Gini values and, presumably, the \ngreatest degrees of equality, at 0.298 and 0.322, respectively.", u"['SDG_11', 'SDG_12']Highly unequal income or consumption patterns in cities in the \ndeveloping world point to institutional and structural failures, \nas  well  as  to  broader  economic  problems  such  as  imbalanced \nlabour markets or a lack of pro-poor policies.", u"['SDG_11', 'SDG_12']The more unequal \nthe distribution of income or consumption in urban areas, the \nhigher the risk that economic disparities will result in social and \npolitical tension.", u"['SDG_10', 'SDG_11']Absence of policy coordination between or within national and \nlocal government constrains cities\u2019 ability to meet the requirements \nof  urban  development  and  to  deploy  strategies  that  mitigate \nspatial inequality.", u"['SDG_11', 'SDG_16']In some cities, necessary public institutions \nare lacking altogether, in which case essentially private vested \ninterests  fill  the  void  and  act  as  substitutes  for  institutions \nthat  would  otherwise  prioritize  the  interests  of  society  at \nlarge.", u"['SDG_3', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_11']As  reflected  in  the  limited  resources  available  for  good \nschooling, health and other facilities in many cities, unequal \nopportunities  create  \u201cminorities  in  the  marketplace\u201d  whose \nindividual members are automatically excluded from a wide \nrange  of  outcomes  associated  with  economic  growth  and \nglobalization  \u2013  including  demand  for  a  skilled  and  healthy \nlabour force.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']Basic \nservices make a significant contribution to the \u201curban advantage\u201d, \nand together with employment feature high among the aspirations \nof  those  who  move  to  cities  in  search  of  a  brighter  future.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_9', 'SDG_11']infrastructure \n\nlabour-intensive \n\nLarge-scale, \nand  urban \nimprovement  works  could  provide  gainful  employment  to  the \npoor as well as their fair share in the \u201curban advantage\u201d.", u"['SDG_2', 'SDG_3', 'SDG_4', 'SDG_11']Based on a systematic comparison of slum with non-slum \npopulations within the same city, and groups of slum dwellers \nsuffering  various  types  of  shelter  deprivations,  this  Report \ndemonstrates with compelling evidence that hunger, health \nand poor education outcomes have strong social class gradients, \nas measured by the intensity of shelter deprivations.", u"['SDG_2', 'SDG_11']More and more urban populations are \nexperiencing hunger and often with more intensity than those \nin  rural  areas.", u"['SDG_1', 'SDG_2', 'SDG_11']Just like poverty, hunger in cities is only the outcome of an \ninequitable distribution of available resources.", u"['SDG_11', 'SDG_12']The structural food crises the urban poor keep experiencing on \nan ongoing basis call for fundamental policy remedies, including \nwith  regard  to  production,  marketing,  distribution,  handling, \nand control of food for the urban market.", u"['SDG_3', 'SDG_11']Slum  upgrading  is  strongly  linked  to  health  and  nutrition \nprogrammes, and altogether should be part of a comprehensive \napproach to improved lives for the urban poor.", u"['SDG_3', 'SDG_11']The poor are typically driven to the least \ndeveloped areas of a city, often places that are poorly integrated \nto the urban fabric, where dilapidated environments lead to \nworse health outcomes and greater risks of premature deaths \nthan  in  improved  and  well-maintained  urban  areas.", u"['SDG_3', 'SDG_5', 'SDG_11']This \nReport  argues  that  cities  where  a  higher  degree  of  equality \nprevails \u2013 including lower income disparities, lower incidence \nof  slums  and  only  small  numbers  of  slum  dwellers  with \nvarious  shelter  deprivations  \u2013  the  occurrence  of  ill  health \ntends to be noticeably less frequent.", u"['SDG_3', 'SDG_11']Conversely, public health \nis generally poorer in more unequal cities that feature stark \nmaterial  differences  in  housing  and  basic  service  provision.", u"['SDG_4', 'SDG_11']Access  to \neducation  is  greater  in  cities  than  in  rural  areas.", u"['SDG_4', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_11']However,  not  all \ncities  are  alike  in  their  accommodation  of  young  people\u2019s \neducation and employment needs.", u"['SDG_4', 'SDG_11']These initial inequalities \nintensify  at  higher  levels  of  education,  perpetuating  and \nreproducing an unfair system that restricts the physical and \nintellectual  potential  of  millions  of  young  urban  dwellers, \nwhose  future  is  denied  or  jeopardized  for  lack  of  equitable \ndistribution policies.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']In some other cities and countries, \nparticularly  in  South-Eastern  and  Eastern  Asia  and  North \nAfrica,  economic  growth  policies  have  gone  hand  in  hand \nwith positive social developments and the populations enjoy \na decent quality of life, but political rights and freedom are \nlagging  behind.", u"['SDG_5', 'SDG_11']Other  cities  and  countries,  mainly  in  sub-\nSaharan Africa and Western Asia, are about to deploy legal \nand political frameworks based on equality and rights.", u"['SDG_11', 'SDG_16']In particular, this right must be seen as a vision for \nan alternative, well-devised, ideal city; instead of a right to \nany  city,  especially  today\u2019s  dominant,  defective  model,  this \nis  an  entitlement  to  an  urban  environment  where  mutual \nrespect,  tolerance,  democracy  and  social  justice  prevail.", u"['SDG_10', 'SDG_11']Taken individually, each of these di-\nmensions has far-reaching consequences for urban dynamics \nand the way policy initiatives can influence inequality.", u"['SDG_5', 'SDG_11']In any of these cases, genuine economic \ninclusion leading to equitable allocation of opportunities and \nincome is, to a very large extent, determined by the political, \ncultural and social equality parameters that are specific to any \ngiven city.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_9', 'SDG_11']In  Asia,  economic  inclusiveness  in  surveyed  cities  is \nassociated  with  government-induced  employment  (through \ninfrastructure  development,  for  example),  together  with \nfiscal incentives and sound contractual and legal frameworks.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_16']Despite \nsignificant  progress \nin  democratic  governance,  expert \nopinion  suggests  that  political  institutions,  rule  of  law  and \naccountability in this region do not always work properly and \nstill fall short of the expectations of urban populations.", u"['SDG_11', 'SDG_16']This \npolitical  call  to  amend  dysfunctional  social  and  economic \ninstitutions is echoed in survey respondents\u2019 perceptions that \nurban policies, reforms and decisions benefit the rich by up to \nthree times as much as they do slum dwellers and the poor.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']In  Latin  American  and  Caribbean  cities  under  review, \nsocial  inclusion  is  associated  with  several  policy  variables, \nparticularly in three areas: change in existing rules to promote \nemployment,  improvements  in  political  governance,  and \nfreedom of cultural expression.", u"['SDG_10', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_16']Where cities fail to deploy institutions and procedures that are \nmore  responsive  to  the  needs  of  ordinary  people  (including  the \npoor), exclusion and social inequality will continue to interfere \nwith effective basic rights and liberties for everyone, a phenomenon \nthat can pose threats to social and political stability.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']In the \nLatin  American  and  Caribbean  cities  under  review,  cultural \ninclusiveness is positively correlated with laws that promote \nequitable employment, as well as with fiscal incentives, micro-\ncredit  and  formal  municipal  promotion  of  culture.", u"['SDG_11', 'SDG_16']The practical strategic steps that contribute to the promotion \nof an inclusive city are the following: (1) assessing the past \nand measuring progress; (2) establishing new, more effective \ninstitutions,  or  strengthening  existing  ones  as  needed;  (3) \nbuilding  new  linkages  and  alliances  among  various  tiers  of \ngovernment;  (4)  developing  a  sustained,  comprehensive \nvision to promote inclusiveness; and (5) ensuring an equitable \nredistribution of opportunities.", u"['SDG_11', 'SDG_16']In  the  cities  of  the \ndeveloping world, existing rules and institutions are generally \nperceived as creations of the rich and powerful that frequently \ncater  to  their  sole  interests,  with  little  regard  for  those  of \nother  social  groups,  particularly  the  poor.", u"['SDG_11', 'SDG_16']Inclusive \ncities conduct in-depth reviews of their systems, structures and \ninstitutional mechanisms to pave the way for genuine change, \nincluding the more effective and stronger institutions that are \npart of a structural and societal transformation process.", u"['SDG_9', 'SDG_11']The  urban  environment  acts  as  the  primary \nlocus  for  innovation,  industrial  and  technological  progress, \nentrepreneurship  and  creativity.", u"['SDG_3', 'SDG_6', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_12']Strong  empirical  evidence \nconfirms  that  the  concentration  of  people  and  productive \nactivities in cities generates economies of scale and proxim-\nity that stimulate growth and reduce the costs of production, \nincluding the delivery of collective basic services such as piped \nwater,  sewers  and  drains,  electricity,  solid  waste  collection, \npublic transport, health care, schools and many other pub-\nlic amenities and services.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']More specifically, improvements in \nthe living conditions of the urban poor, investment in human \ncapital and fostering employment opportunities are designed \nto affirm social and economic inclusion and rights, and the \nother two catalysts explicitly focus on political and cultural \ninclusion and rights.", u"['SDG_1', 'SDG_11']Urban sprawl in an environment of poverty \n\nexacerbates the urban divide.", u"['SDG_5', 'SDG_10', 'SDG_11']Worldwide urbanization is inevitable, and \n\ngenerally positive, but equality or inequality in \ncities is influenced by policy choices.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_12']The urbanization process is characterized not only by demo-\ngraphic shifts from rural to urban areas, or by the growth of urban \npopulations, but also by changes in various aspects of society: \n\n\u2022\t in the employment sector, from agriculture-based activities \n\nto mass production and service industries; \n\u2022\t in societal values and modes of governance; \n\u2022\t in \n\nthe  configuration  and \n\nfunctionality  of  human \n\nsettlements; \n\n\u2022\t in the spatial scale, density and activities of places; and \n\u2022\t in the composition of social, cultural and ethnic groups and \nthe  extension  of  democratic  rights,  particularly  women\u2019s \nempowerment.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']Such \nanalysis also points to the need to design economic recovery \npolicies, rethink urban and regional strategies and create new \nopportunities;  it  also  offers  insights  into  to  the  best  ways \nof  anticipating  urbanization  and  managing  the  negative \nconsequences of urban growth, such as asymmetrical regional \nand  urban  development  and  various  types  of  disparities.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']Convergent Urban growth Patterns \n\nA slower though more pervasive urbanization\n\nIf current projections are anything to go by, virtually the \nwhole of the world\u2019s demographic growth over the next 30 \nyears will be concentrated in urban areas \u2013 a stark contrast \nwith  the  pattern  that  prevailed  between  1950  and  1975,  a \nperiod characterized by a much more balanced split between \nurban  and  rural  areas.2  At  the  same  time,  the  pace  of \nurbanization in the world is not accelerating, not even in the \ndeveloping  world.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']The  decade  when  urban \ndemographic expansion was at its fastest across the world was

economic  development  is  more \ntenuous, particularly in sub-Saharan countries; however, recent \nresearch  suggests  a  positive  link  between  the  two  variables \nin  most  African  countries,  as  is  generally  the  case  in  other \nregions.5 For instance, Rwanda in the late 1990s experienced \na very high annual urban growth rate of more than 17 per \ncent  as  the  country  rebuilt  after  a  severe  conflict;  the  pace \nslowed  down  to  a  relatively  high  7  per  cent  between  2000 \nand 2005, and to just over 4 per cent between 2005 and 2010 \n(estimates).", u"['SDG_8',

and 9 per cent since 2002.6 Although today less than \n20 per cent of Rwanda\u2019s population is urban, the proportion \nis expected to rise to nearly 30 per cent by 2030, compared \nwith just 20 per

u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']Those  regions  that  are  economically  successful  are \nnot  only  more  urbanized  than  others  in  the  same  country: \nthey  are  also  experiencing  urban  population

\nhigher standards of living, enhanced democratic accountability, \nand women\u2019s empowerment.8 In this sense, urbanization can \nbe a positive force for economic development, and also one \nthat has desirable social and political outcomes; indeed, some \nof the world\u2019s fastest-growing cities are also among the best \ngoverned, and some provide the best quality of life in their \nrespective nations.9 In those cases where urbanization has not \nbeen concomitant with significant improvements in quality of \nlife or governance, other, divisive factors may be at play, such as \nextreme inequalities, conflict, inadequate or ineffective policies, \nwhich can block development or substantially set back progress.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']Mega-regions are natural economic \nunits

\nsurrounded  by  low-density  hinterlands,  and  they  grow \nconsiderably faster than the overall population of the nations \nin  which  they  are  located.12  Urban  corridors,  on  the  other \nhand,  are  characterized  by  linear  systems  of  urban  spaces \nlinked  through  transportation  networks.13  Other  dynamic \nand strategic cities are extending beyond their administrative

plan-\nners to work together; \n\n\u2022\t Broader  plans  for  regional  planning/development,  \u201crequir-\ning dispersion of specific urban functions (i.e., solid waste \ntreatment,  airports,  skills  and  training  centres)  within  a \ncontinuous region, rather than crowding them in a large \ncity\u201d; and\n\n\u2022\t Coping  with  horizontal  fiscal  disparities,  and  more

can be more affordable than in central \nareas, with lower densities and a better quality of life in certain \nways.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_12']Spatial expansion is also triggered by changes \nin lifestyles that are disseminated through large urban centres, \npropelled by the globalization of consumption patterns, in turn \nbringing more homogeneity across diverse areas of the world.24\nThe suburban growth pattern of urbanization has long been \nstrongly associated with North American cities; over the past \ndecade, though, there have been signs that suburbanization, \nor  what  is  known  as  a  form  of  \u201chorizontal  spreading\u201d, \n\u201cdispersed  urbanization\u201d  or  urban  sprawl,  is  happening  in \nmany  metropolitan  areas  of  the  world.",

are  misaligned.", u"['SDG_9', 'SDG_11']In  many  developing  countries,  urban  sprawl  generates \na  configuration  involving  two  main,  contrasting  types \nof  development  in  one  and  the

\n\u201csuburban sprawl\u201d characterized by residential zones for high- \nand  middle-income  groups  and  highly  valued  commercial \nand  retail  complexes  that  are  well-connected  by  individual \nrather than public transport.", u"['SDG_1', 'SDG_11']In most cases, residential areas \ncoexist  with  huge  commercial  centres  located  along  main \nhighways.28 In some developing countries, urban sprawl is the \nconsequence of poverty, not affluence, as informal unplanned \nsettlements on the periphery spring up in response to a lack \nof  affordable  housing  options  within  the  city  itself.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']In  this \nsense, urban sprawl results from a lack of policy attention to \ncurrent  urban  challenges  (slums,  land,  services,  transport), \nand more particularly an inability to anticipate urban growth, \nincluding  through  provision  of  land  for  the  urbanizing \npoor.", u"['SDG_9', 'SDG_11']It has a negative impact not \nonly  on  the

\nmuch  more  energy  than  compact  cities  and  require  larger \noutputs of materials such as metal, concrete and asphalt because \nhomes, offices and utilities are farther apart.31 Sprawl also creates \nfiscal problems for cities, as it takes place outside of urban \nadministrative  boundaries.", u"['SDG_6', 'SDG_11']In the absence of proper planning, urban sprawl also \ncontributes to the degradation of a number of environmental \nresources;  for  instance,  it  has  caused  substantial  damage \nto  environmentally  sensitive  areas  around  several  cities  in \nLatin America,

\nconcentration of poor people in cities instead of rural areas, \nand there will be no significant overall poverty reduction.23\nEmpirical  evidence  also  indicates  an  inverse  relationship \nbetween the degree of urbanization and the overall incidence \nof  poverty  in  individual  countries:  as  shown  in  Figure \n1.2.9,  countries  that  are  more  urbanized  tend  to  feature

\n1. assessing the past and measuring progress;\n2. establishing new, more effective institutions, or strengthen-\n\ning existing ones as needed; \n\n3. building new linkages and alliances across tiers of govern-\n\nment; \n\ninclusiveness; and \n\n4. developing a sustained, comprehensive vision to promote \n\n5. ensuring an equitable redistribution of opportunities.", u"['SDG_11', 'SDG_16']It takes four steps to close the urban divide: \n\nnew or strengthened, more effective \ninstitutions; new linkages and alliances \nacross the three tiers of government; a \nsustained, comprehensive vision to promote \ninclusiveness; and ensuring an equitable \nredistribution of opportunities.", u"['SDG_11', 'SDG_16']Just  like  its  intended  outcome,  a  situation \nanalysis of a city should be inclusive, i.e., involve municipal \nauthorities, the business, utility and financial sectors, social \nmovements,  micro-finance  institutions,  private  developers, \ninvestors and any relevant central government departments.", u"['SDG_11', 'SDG_16']More effective, stronger institutions\n\nMost  of  the  experts  participating  in  the  UN-HABITAT \nurban  policy  analysis  in  the  developing  world  agreed  that \nexisting  rules  and  institutions  are  creations  of  the  rich  and \npowerful, and frequently cater solely to their interests with \nlittle regard for those of other social groups, particularly the \npoor.", u"['SDG_11', 'SDG_16']Today, evidence from successful cities shows that the way \nmunicipalities  perform  their  duties  is  just  as  important  as \nthe nature of what they achieve.3 Inclusive cities conduct in-\ndepth  reviews  of  their  systems,  structures  and  institutional \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n

\nparticularly  good  instance  of  proper  coordination  between \ncentral and municipal government: local implementation of \nthe 1996 national \u201cGrowth, Employment and Redistribution \nPolicy\u201d required a restructuring of public sector institutions \nin the city and deployment of new policy frameworks for the \ndelivery of social services, in order to match the mandates set

 a  recognized  best  practice.", u"['SDG_11', 'SDG_16']However,  the  UN-HABITAT  policy  analysis  shows  that  a \nnumber of cities fail to establish such institutions (owing to \nlimited  institutional  or  organizational  capacities,  or  lack  of \n\ninterest  or  focus),  and  as  a  result  laws  and  policies  do  not \nachieve intended goals.", u"['SDG_11', 'SDG_16']New

between  local  and \ncentral  authorities  has  resulted  in  a  gradual  expansion  of \nfunctions  and  capacities  that  were  traditionally  assigned  to \nlocal  governments  (basic  infrastructure,  urban  transport, \nmanagement of public spaces) to include more complex areas \n(resource management, environmental protection, promotion \nof competitiveness, capital investment, financing and other \nproductive  functions).", u"['SDG_1', 'SDG_11']This is why municipal \nauthorities must address the major factors behind the current \nurban  divide  \u2013  social  inequalities,  poverty  and  exclusion.", u"['SDG_1', 'SDG_4', 'SDG_11']Com-\nbining the broad perspective of the generalist and the focused expertise \nof the specialist, planners can better

\ndetermined to meet this challenge.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_9', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_12']The  urban \nenvironment also is the primary locus for innovation, industrial \nand technological progress,

can dramatically reduce the \ncosts of production and stimulate growth.", u"['SDG_6', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_13']On  top  of  this  by  now  all-too-\nfamiliar  predicament,  many  cities  also  face  emerging  risks \nin  connection  with  climate  change,  diseases  on  pandemic \nscales  and  shortages  of  food  and  water.", u"['SDG_9', 'SDG_11', 'SDG_16']However, all these challenges are \noutnumbered by opportunities: cities will continue to stand \nat the crossroads of an interdependent world, producing the \n\nbulk of ideas, trade, innovation and creativity, together with \nthe  necessary  institutions  and  other  forms  of  financial  and \nintellectual capital that can be used to overcome, or exacerbate, \nthe urban divide.37 \n\nProactive  cities  can  redistribute  opportunities  in  many \ndifferent ways.", u"['SDG_4', 'SDG_11']For instance, the municipality of Medell\xedn has \nmade massive investments in education in a bid to break the \ncycle of violence and narrow the urban divide.", u"['SDG_9', 'SDG_11']The response took the form of a variety of educational and \nnutritional programmes, especially for children under 6 years \nold.38 Some cities opt to focus on transportation, with vast \ninfrastructure plans spread out over many years to improve \nconnections for poor communities, in the process expanding \nsocial  and  economic  opportunities.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']The  benefits  combine  additional  affordable  housing,  job \ncreation and a more dynamic local economy through better \nconnections between slums and employment opportunities

'SDG_11', 'SDG_16']For  instance,  a  regulatory  framework  can  be  adjusted  to \nfacilitate  the  creation  of  pro-poor  policies,  some  of  which \ncan also favour overall economic growth, if only over time.46 \nParticipatory  decision-making  mechanisms  can  also  be \ndesigned to facilitate the engagement of the urban poor, since \n\u201cthey have the ability to influence those local decisions and \npolicies  that  greatly  determine  the  \u2018pro-poorness\u2019  of  local \nstrategic planning, priority setting and capital investments\u201d.47 \nThe  2009  UN-HABITAT  survey

physical separation of residential\nareas from places of employment, markets, schools and health services force many urban residents to spend increasing\namounts of time, and as much as a third (and sometimes even more) of their income, on public transport.", u"['SDG_9', 'SDG_11']Thus, urban planning and design should focus on how\nto bring people and places together, by creating cities that focus on accessibility, rather than simply increasing the\nlength of urban transport infrastructure or increasing the movement of people or goods.", u"['SDG_9', 'SDG_11']Most of\ntoday\u2019s cities have been built as \u2018zoned\u2019 cities, which tends to make rather inef\ufb01cient use of their infrastructure;\nas \u2018everyone\u2019 is travelling in the same direction at the same time.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']In such cities, each morning is characterized by\n(often severe) traf\ufb01c jams on roads and congestion on public transport services leading from residential areas to\nplaces of work.", u"['SDG_9', 'SDG_11']Thus, the infrastructure in such cities is operating at half capacity\nonly, despite congestion.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_9', 'SDG_11']In contrast, in cities characterized by \u2018mixed land-use\u2019 (such as Stockholm, Sweden),\ntraf\ufb01c \ufb02ows are multidirectional \u2013 thus making more ef\ufb01cient use of the infrastructure \u2013 as residential areas

be a distinguishing\nfeature  of  urban  areas,  where  more  than  half  of \nthe  world\u2019s  population  currently  reside.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_11']By  2005,\napproximately 7.5 billion trips were made each day\nin cities worldwide.1 In 2050, there may be three to\nfour times as many passen ger-kilometres travelled as\nin the year 2000, infra struc ture and energy prices\npermitting.2 Freight movement could also rise more\nthan  threefold  during  the  same  period.3 Mobility\n\ufb02ows have become a key dynamic of urbanization,\nwith the associated infra struc ture invariably consti -\ntut ing the backbone of urban form.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']What is perhaps even more striking is the\nregional patterns of urban population growth.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']Figure\n1.1 shows how an increasing share of this growth is\nprojected  to  occur  in  Africa  (19  per  cent  of  total\nannual  growth  today,  compared  to  43  per  cent  in\n2045),  while  the  combined  annual  urban  popula-\ntion  increase  in  developed  countries,  China,  Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean is projected to decrease\nfrom 46 per cent of the total today to 11 per cent\nin 2045.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_8', 'SDG_11']China alone is projected to\nhave approximately 350 million private cars by 2035,\nnearly ten times as many as they had in 2008.10 In\nsome rapidly emerging economies such as India, the\nnumber of cars, trucks, and motorized two-wheelers\non city streets is growing at a rate of more than 20\nper cent annually.11 Mexico City\u2019s car population is\nincreasing faster than its human population \u2013 two\nnew cars enter into circulation every time a child is\nborn.12 In  India,  private  vehicle  growth  exceeds\npopulation gains by a factor of three.13\n\nThe  extent  of  global  motorization  is  a  major\ncause  for  the  increasing  trends  in  energy  use  and\ncarbon emissions worldwide.", u"['SDG_9', 'SDG_11']Following  the  Second  World  War,  the  US  govern-\nment  invested  heavily  in  high-capacity  highways \nand freeways and subsidized home mortgages, while\nmost  of  its  European  counterparts  channelled \nfunds into devel op ment of urban rail systems, and\nsocial and market-rate housing near public trans port\nstops.14\n\nMobility is not\nonly a matter of\ndeveloping\ntransport\ninfrastructure and\nservices, but also\nof overcoming the\nsocial, economic,\npolitical and\nphysical\nconstraints to\nmovement\n\nIn many cities of\nthe world, the\nequation of\n\u2018mobility\u2019 with\n\u2018transportation\u2019\nhas fostered a\ntendency towards\nincreasing\nmotorization, and\na propensity to\nexpand the\nnetwork of urban\nroads\n\nGlobally, the\ntransport bias of\nurban mobility is\ndemonstrated by\nthe dominance of\n.", u"['SDG_7', 'SDG_9', 'SDG_11']Factors such as\nshrinking city\nsizes and lifestyle\nchanges are\ncontributing to\nlevelling off of car\nownership and\nusage in\ndeveloped\ncountries \n\nAnother feature\nof the transport\nbias has been\nheavy investments\nin infrastructure\n\nHowever, global motorization explains only part\nof  the  increasing  energy  use  and  greenhouse  gas\nemissions  worldwide.", u"['SDG_9', 'SDG_11']The interplay of these\nsystems has rede\ufb01ned the core of social interaction\nand  urban  life.26 Accordingly,  the  evolving  trans-\nport system of the last century is \ufb01rmly rooted in a\nnumber  of  key  components  including  motorized\nmodes,  oil  industry,  consumerist  lifestyles,  global\nprocurement of oil, spatial and infra struc ture plan -\nning,  urban  and  street  design  and  societal  values \nthat embrace mobility as part of what constitutes high\nquality of life standards.27\n\n\x0c5\n\nFigure 1.3

the \nurban quality of life, consumption of fossil fuels, air\npollution and economic growth and prosperity.", u"['SDG_8', 'SDG_11']In general, the per -\ncentage of the total land area devoted to
