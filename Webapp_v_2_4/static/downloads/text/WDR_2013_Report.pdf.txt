About the cover

In almost every language there is a range of words related to 
jobs, each emphasizing a different angle. Some words hint at 
the nature of the activity being performed, evoking the skill or 
expertise that is required. Others refer to the volume of human 
inputs used in production, bringing images of effort and con-
veying a sense of physical exertion. There are also words asso-
ciated with the sheer numbers of people engaged in economic 
activity, which are more easily associated with aggregate sta-
tistics. In other cases, what seems to be at stake is a contrac-
tual relationship, involving mutual obligations and a degree of 
stability. In some languages, there are even words to designate 
the place where the person works, or at least a slot in a produc-
tion process. This multiplicity of words clearly shows that jobs 
are multi-dimensional and cannot be characterized by a single 
term or measured by a single indicator.

Words related to jobs do not always translate well from one 
language to another, as the range of options available in each 
case  can  be  different.  If  languages  shape  thinking,  there  are 
times when the ways in which people refer to jobs seem to be 
at odds. Gaps probably arise from the different characteristics 
of jobs being emphasized in different societies. They also sug-
gest that jobs’ agendas can differ across countries.

In many languages, words related to jobs serve not only as 
common  nouns  but  also  as  proper  nouns.  Throughout  his-
tory family names have been associated with specific skills or 
trades: Vankar in Hindi, Hattori in Japanese, Herrero in Span-
ish,  or  Mfundisi  in  Zulu,  just  to  mention  a  few.  The  use  of 
job-related words as household identifiers shows that people 
associated themselves with what they did. Nowadays, people aspire to choose their jobs based 
on what motivates them and on what could make their lives more meaningful. In almost every 
language there are also several words to express the lack of a job. Almost invariably these words 
have a negative connotation, close in spirit to deprivation; at times they even carry an element 
of stigma. In all these ways, language conveys the idea that jobs are more than what people 
earn, or what they do at work: they are also part of who they are.

Foreword

Today, jobs are a critical concern across the globe—for policy makers, the business community, 
and the billions of men and women striving to provide for their families. 

As the world struggles to emerge from the global crisis, some 200 million people—includ-
ing  75  million  under  the  age  of  25—are  unemployed.  Many  millions  more,  most  of  them 
women, find themselves shut out of the labor force altogether. Looking forward, over the next 
15 years an additional 600 million new jobs will be needed to absorb burgeoning working-age 
populations, mainly in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.

Meanwhile, almost half of all workers in developing countries are engaged in small-scale 
farming or self-employment, jobs that typically do not come with a steady paycheck and ben-
efits. The problem for most poor people in these countries is not the lack of a job or too few 
hours of work; many hold more than one job and work long hours. Yet, too often, they are not 
earning enough to secure a better future for themselves and their children, and at times they 
are working in unsafe conditions and without the protection of their basic rights.  

Jobs are instrumental to achieving economic and social development.  Beyond their critical 
importance  for  individual  well-being,  they  lie  at  the  heart  of  many  broader  societal  objec-
tives, such as poverty reduction, economy-wide productivity growth, and social cohesion. The 
development payoffs from jobs include acquiring skills, empowering women, and stabilizing 
post-conflict societies. Jobs that contribute to these broader goals are valuable not only for 
those who hold them but for society as a whole: they are good jobs for development.

The World Development Report 2013 takes the centrality of jobs in the development pro-
cess as its starting point and challenges and reframes how we think about work. Adopting a 
cross-sectoral and multidisciplinary approach, the Report looks at why some jobs do more for 
development than others. The Report finds that the jobs with the greatest development payoffs 
are those that make cities function better, connect the economy to global markets, protect the 
environment, foster trust and civic engagement, or reduce poverty. Critically, these jobs are not 
only found in the formal sector; depending on the country context, informal jobs can also be 
transformational.

Building on this framework, the Report tackles some of the most pressing questions policy 
makers are asking right now: Should countries design their development strategies around 
growth or focus on jobs? Are there situations where the focus should be on protecting jobs  
as opposed to protecting workers? Which needs to come first in the development process—
creating jobs or building skills? 

The private sector is the key engine of job creation, accounting for 90 percent of all jobs in 
the developing world. But governments play a vital role by ensuring that the conditions are in 
place for strong private sector–led growth and by alleviating the constraints that hinder the 
private sector from creating good jobs for development.  

The Report advances a three-stage approach to help governments meet these objectives. 
First,  policy  fundamentals—including  macroeconomic  stability,  an  enabling  business  envi-
ronment, investments in human capital, and the rule of law—are essential for both growth and 
job creation. Second, well-designed labor policies can help ensure that growth translates into 
employment opportunities, but they need to be complemented by a broader approach to job 
creation that looks beyond the labor market. Third, governments should strategically identify 

xiii

which jobs would do the most for development given their specific country context, and re-
move or offset the obstacles that prevent the private sector from creating more of those jobs. 
In today’s global economy, the world of work is rapidly evolving. Demographic shifts, tech-
nological progress, and the lasting effects of the international financial crisis are reshaping the 
employment landscape in countries around the world. Countries that successfully adapt to 
these changes and meet their jobs challenges can achieve dramatic gains in living standards, 
productivity growth, and more cohesive societies. Those that do not will miss out on the trans-
formational effects of economic and social development. 

The World Development Report 2013 is an important contribution to our collective under-
standing of the role of jobs in development. Its insights will provide valuable guidance for the 
World Bank Group as we collaborate with partners and clients to advance their jobs agendas. 
Working together, we can foster job creation and maximize the development impact of jobs.

DAtA notes 
The use of the word countries to refer to economies implies no judgment by the World Bank 
about the legal or other status of territory. The term developing countries includes low- and 
middle-income economies and thus may include economies in transition from central plan-
ning, as a matter of convenience. Dollar figures are current U.S. dollars, unless otherwise 
specified. Billion means 1,000 million; trillion means 1,000 billion.

overview

Moving jobs center stage

Jobs  are  the  cornerstone  of  economic  and 

 social  development.  Indeed,  development 
happens  through  jobs.  People  work  their 
way out of poverty and hardship through bet-
ter livelihoods. Economies grow as people get 
better at what they do, as they move from farms 
to firms, and as more productive jobs are cre-
ated and less productive ones disappear. Soci-
eties  flourish  as  jobs  bring  together  people 
from  different  ethnic  and  social  backgrounds 
and  nurture  a  sense  of  opportunity.  Jobs  are 
thus  transformational—they  can  transform 
what  we  earn,  what  we  do,  and  even  who  we 
are. 

No  surprise,  then,  that  jobs  are  atop  the 
development  agenda  everywhere—for  every-
one from policy makers to the populace, from 
business leaders to union representatives, from 
activists to academics. Looking to seize oppor-
tunities  for  job  creation  presented  by  massive 
demographic  shifts,  technological  innovations, 
global migrations of people and tasks, and deep 
changes in the nature of work, policy makers ask 
difficult questions:
•   Should  countries  build  their  development 
strategies  around  growth  or  should  they  
rather focus on jobs? 

•   Can  entrepreneurship  be  fostered,  especially 
among  the  many  microenterprises  in  devel-
oping countries, or are entrepreneurs born? 

•   While jobs can contribute to social cohesion, 
is there anything governments can do about 
it, apart from trying to support job creation? 
•   Are  greater  investments  in  education  and 
training  a  prerequisite  for  employability,  or 
can skills be built through jobs? 

•   Should efforts to improve the investment cli-
mate target the areas, activities, or firms with 
greater potential for job creation? 

•   What  is  the  risk  that  policies  to  foster  job  
creation in one country will come at the ex-
pense of jobs in other countries?

•   When confronted with large shocks and ma-
jor restructuring, is it advisable to protect jobs 
and not just people? 

•   How  can  the  reallocation  of  workers  be  ac-
celerated  from  areas  and  activities  with  low 
productivity to those with greater potential?

Individuals  value  jobs  for  the  earnings  and 
benefits they provide, as well as for their contri-
butions to self-esteem and happiness. But some 
jobs  have  broader  impacts  on  society.  Jobs  for 
women  can  change  the  way  households  spend 
money and invest in the education and health 
of  children.  Jobs  in  cities  support  greater  spe-
cialization  and  the  exchange  of  ideas,  making 
other  jobs  more  productive.  Jobs  connected  
to global markets bring home new technologi-

cal and managerial knowledge. And in turbulent 
environments, jobs for young men can provide 
alternatives to violence and help restore peace.

Through  their  broader  influence  on  living 
standards,  productivity,  and  social  cohesion, 
these jobs have an even greater value to society 
than they do for the individual. But some jobs 
can  have  negative  spillovers.  Jobs  supported 
through  transfers  or  privilege  represent  a  bur-
den to others or undermine their opportunities 
to find remunerative employment. Jobs damag-
ing  the  environment  take  a  toll  on  everybody. 
Thus it is that some jobs do more for develop-
ment, while others may do little, even if they are 
appealing to individuals.

Which  jobs  have  the  greatest  develop-
ment  payoffs  depends  on  the  circumstances. 
Countries differ in their level of development,  
demography,  endowments,  and  institutions. 
Agrarian socie ties face the challenge of making 
agricultural  jobs  more  productive  and  creat-
ing job opportunities outside farms. Resource-
rich  countries  need  to  diversify  their  exports, 
so  that  jobs  are  connected  to  global  markets 
rather  than  supported  through  government 
transfers.  Formalizing  countries  need  to  de-
sign  their  social  protection  systems  in  ways 
that  extend  their  coverage  without  penalizing 
employment. 

A  vast  majority  of  jobs  are  created  by  the 
private  sector.  Governments,  though,  can  sup-
port—or  hinder—the  private  sector  in  creat-
ing  jobs.  The  idea  that  development  happens 
through jobs sheds new light on the strategies, 
policies,  and  programs  governments  can  pur-
sue.  Strategies  should  identify  which  types  of 
jobs would have the highest development pay-
offs,  given  a  country’s  circumstances.  Policies 
should  remove  the  obstacles  that  prevent  the 
private sector from creating jobs. Programs for 
generating employment may also be warranted, 
for instance, in conflict-affected countries. But 
the costs and benefits of these policies and pro-
grams have to be assessed, taking into account 
the potential spillovers from jobs, both positive 
and negative.

At  a  more  practical  level,  this  jobs  lens  on 
devel opment  leads  to  a  three-layered  policy 
approach:
•   Fundamentals.  Because  jobs  provide  higher 
earnings and broader social benefits as coun-

tries  grow  richer,  the  policy  environment 
must  be  conducive  to  growth.  That  requires 
attending to macroeconomic stability, an en-
abling  business  environment,  human  capital 
accumulation, and the rule of law.

•   Labor policies. Because growth alone may not 
be  enough,  labor  policies  need  to  facilitate 
job  creation  and  enhance  the  development 
payoffs from jobs. Policies can address labor 
market distortions while not being a drag on 
efficiency. But they should avoid distortion-
ary  interventions  that  constrain  employ-
ment in cities and global value chains—and 
provide  voice  and  protection  for  the  most 
vulnerable.

•   Priorities.  Because  some  jobs  do  more  for 
development  than  others,  it  is  necessary  to 
identify  the  types  of  jobs  with  the  greatest 
development payoffs given a country’s con-
text, and to remove—or at least offset—the 
market imperfections and institutional fail-
ures that result in too few of those jobs being 
created.

The  centrality  of  jobs  for  development 
should  not  be  interpreted  as  the  centrality  of 
labor  policies  and  institutions.  Nearly  half 
the  people  at  work  in  developing  countries 
are  farmers  or  self-employed  and  so  are  out-
side the labor market. And even in the case of 
wage  employment,  labor  policies  and  institu-
tions may or may not be the main obstacle to 
job creation. Often, the most relevant obstacles 
lie  outside  of  the  labor  market.  The  catalysts 
for job creation may be policies that make cit-
ies work better, help farmers access and apply 
appropriate  agricultural  techniques,  or  allow 
firms to develop new exports. Jobs are the cor-
nerstone  of  development,  and  development 
policies are needed for jobs.

Jobs wanted

To many, a “job” brings to mind a worker with 
an  employer  and  a  regular  paycheck.  Yet,  the 
majority  of  workers  in  the  poorest  countries 
are outside the scope of an employer-employee 
relationship.  Worldwide,  more  than  3  billion 
people are working, but their jobs vary greatly. 
Some 1.65 billion are employed and receive reg-

ular wages or salaries. Another 1.5 billion work 
in farming and small household enterprises, or 
in casual or seasonal day labor. Meanwhile, 200 
million people, a disproportionate share of them 
youth, are unemployed and actively looking for 
work. Almost 2 billion working-age adults, the 
majority  of  them  women,  are  neither  working 
nor looking for work, but an unknown number 
of them are eager to have a job. Clarifying what 
is meant by a job is thus a useful starting point.
The  meaning  of  the  words  used  to  de-
scribe  what  people  do  to  earn  a  living  varies 
across  countries  and  cultures.  Some  words  re-
fer to workers in offices or factories. Others are 
broader,  encompassing  farmers,  self-employed 
vendors in cities, and caregivers of children and 
the elderly. The distinction is not merely seman-
tic.  The  varied  meanings  hint  at  the  different 
aspects of jobs that people value. And views on 
what a job is almost inevitably influence views 
on what policies for jobs should look like.

For  statisticians,  a  job  is “a  set  of  tasks  and 
duties  performed,  or  meant  to  be  performed, 
by  one  person,  including  for  an  employer  or 
in  self-employment.”1 Jobs  are  performed  by 
the employed. These are defined as people who 
produce  goods  and  services  for  the  market  or 
for their own use. But the statistical definition 
is  mute  about  what  should  not  be  considered 
a  job.  International  norms  view  basic  human 

rights as the boundaries of what is unacceptable. 
Among them are the United Nations Universal 
Declaration  of  Human  Rights  (1948)  and  the 
International Labour Organization Declaration 
on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work 
(1998), which further specifies core labor stan-
dards.  Combining  these  different  perspectives, 
jobs are activities that generate income, mone-
tary or in kind, without violating human rights.

Different places, different jobs

The world of work is particularly diverse in de-
veloping countries. This variety refers not only 
to the number of hours worked and the number 
of jobs available, the usual yardsticks in indus-
trial countries, but also to the characteristics of 
jobs.  Two  main  aspects  stand  out.  One  is  the 
prevalence  of  self-employment  and  farming.2 
The other is the coexistence of traditional and 
modern modes of production, from subsistence 
agriculture and low-skilled work to technology-
driven  manufacturing  and  services  and  highly 
skilled knowledge work.

While nearly half of the jobs in the developing 
world are outside the labor market, the shares of 
wage work, farming, and self- employment differ 
greatly across countries.3 Nonwage work repre-
sents  more  than  80  percent  of  women’s  em-
ployment in Sub-Saharan  Africa—but less than

20 percent in Eastern Europe and Central Asia 
(figure 1). 

Work  across  the  developing  world  is  also 
characterized by a high prevalence of informal-
ity, whether defined on the basis of lack of firm 
registration, lack of social security coverage, or 
lack of an employment contract. Informal em-
ployment is not under the purview of labor reg-
ulations, either because of their limited scope or 
because of deliberate avoidance or evasion. Re-
gardless of the specific definition used, informal-
ity is generally associated with lower productiv-
ity. However, this does not necessarily mean that 
formalization would result in greater efficiency. 
Informality can be a symptom of lower produc-
tivity as much as it can be a cause of it.4

Gender  and  age  differences  are  striking. 
Worldwide, fewer than half of women have jobs, 
compared  with  almost  four-fifths  of  men.  In 
Pakistan,  28  percent  of  women  but  more  than 
82 percent of men participate in the labor force, 
whereas participation rates are above 75 percent 

for both men and women in Tanzania and Viet-
nam. Beyond these stark contrasts in participa-
tion, women continue to earn significantly less 
than men, and the differences are not fully ex-
plained  by  education,  experience,  or  sector  of 
work. While a growing share of youth between 
ages  15  and  24  allocate  most  of  their  time  to 
schooling and training, youth unemployment is 
still alarming in some countries (above 40 per-
cent in South Africa since early 2008 and above 
50  percent  in  Spain  in  early  2012).5  Even  in 
countries where it is low, youth unemployment 
is  twice  the  national  average  or  more.  In  addi-
tion, 621 million young people are “idle”—not 
in  school  or  training,  not  employed,  and  not 
looking  for  work.  Rates  of  idleness  vary  across 
countries,  ranging  between  10  and  50  percent 
among  15-  to  24-year-olds  (figure  2).6  Many 
youth work in unpaid jobs; if paid, they are less 
likely to have social insurance.7

The changing world of work

This  complex  picture  is  compounded  by  mas-
sive  demographic  shifts.  To  keep  employment 
as a share of the working-age population con-
stant, in 2020 there should be around 600 mil-
lion more jobs than in 2005, a majority of them 
in  Asia  and  Sub-Saharan  Africa.  While  some 
countries have experienced very large increases 
in their labor force—nearly 8 million new en-
trants a year in China since the mid-1990s and 7 
million in India—others face a shrinking popu-
lation. Ukraine’s labor force, for example, is es-
timated to fall by about 160,000 people a year.8
Rapid  urbanization  is  changing  the  com-
position  of  employment.  More  than  half  the 
population in developing countries is expected 
to  be  living  in  cities  and  towns  before  2020.9 
As  a  result,  the  growth  of  the  nonagricultural 
labor force will vastly exceed the growth of the 
agricultural labor force. This structural change, 
which in industrial countries took decades, now 
transforms  lives  in  developing  countries  in  a 
generation.  Structural  change  can  bring  about 
remarkable  improvements  in  efficiency,  and 
some  developing  countries  have  narrowed  the 
productivity gap with industrial countries rap-
idly. But others have failed to catch up.10 Over-
all, the gap between developing and developed 
regions remains wide. 

Globalization  is  also  changing  the  nature 
of  jobs.  Industrial  countries  are  shifting  from

primary  and  traditional  manufacturing  indus-
tries  toward  services  and  knowledge-intensive 
activities.11  At  the  same  time,  technological 
improvements  and  outsourcing  to  developing 
countries  are  leading  to  a  decline  in  medium-
skilled jobs.12 Production tasks have been splin-
tered so that they can be performed in different 
locations.13 Transnational companies have built 
integrated value chains to tap into national skill 
pools  around  the  world.14  Outsourcing  is  oc-
curring in services as well as in manufacturing. 
The share of developing countries in exports of 
world services nearly doubled to 21 percent be-
tween 1990 and 2008.15

Technology is changing the way workers and 
firms  connect,  through  their  access  to  much 
larger,  even  global,  employment  marketplaces. 
Some of the new marketplaces operate through 
the internet; others use mobile phone technol-
ogy.16  Part-time  and  temporary  wage  employ-
ment are now major features of industrial and 
developing  countries.  In  South  Africa,  tempo-
rary agency workers make up about 7 percent of 
the labor force; the temporary staffing industry 
provides employment to an average of 410,000 
workers a day. In India, the number of tempo-
rary workers that employment agencies recruit 
grew more than 10 percent in 2009 and 18 per-
cent in 2010.17

This  changing  landscape  of  global  produc-
tion  has  also  brought  about  shifts  in  skill  en-
dowments and in the world distribution of top 
talent. China and India rank high in perceived 
attractiveness  as  outsourcing  hubs  because  of 
their  exceptionally  high  ratings  in  the  avail-
ability  of  skills.18  India  has  close  to  20  million 
students in higher education, nearly as many as 
the United States; both countries are outpaced 
by  China,  with  30  million  postsecondary  stu-
dents.19  The  United  States  still  accounts  for  a 
large share of top scores in international student 
assessments, but the Republic of Korea has the 
same share as Germany, and both are closely fol-
lowed by the Russian Federation. The number 
of high-performing students in Shanghai alone 
is  one-fifth  that  of  Germany  and  about  twice 
that of Argentina.20

The role of the private sector

In such rapidly changing times, the private sec-
tor is the main engine of job creation and the 
source of almost 9 of every 10 jobs in the world. 

Between  1995  and  2005,  the  private  sector  ac-
counted for 90 percent of jobs created in Bra-
zil,  and  for  95  percent  in  the  Philippines  and 
Turkey.21 The most remarkable example of the 
 expansion of employment through private sec-
tor growth is China. In 1981, private sector em-
ployment  accounted  for  2.3  million  workers, 
while  state-owned  enterprises  (SOEs)  had  80 
million workers.22 Twenty years later, the private 
sector accounted for 74.7 million workers, sur-
passing, for the first time, the 74.6 million work-
ers in SOEs (figure 3). 

In  contrast  to  the  global  average,  in  some 
countries in the Middle East and North Africa, 
the state is a leading employer, a pattern that can 
be linked to the political economy of the post-
independence period, and in some cases to the 
abundance of oil revenues.23 For a long period, 
public sector jobs were offered to young college 
graduates. But as the fiscal space for continued 
expansion in public sector employment shrank, 
“queuing”  for  public  sector  jobs  became  more 
prevalent, leading to informality, a devaluation 
of  educational  credentials,  and  forms  of  social 
exclusion.24  A  fairly  well-educated  and  young 
labor force remains unemployed, or underem-
ployed, and labor productivity stagnates.25

Overall,  countries  have  been  successful  at 
creating jobs. More people have jobs now than 
ever  before,  and  those  jobs  provide  generally 
higher earnings. Indeed, amid rapid social and 
economic  change,  poverty  has  declined  in  de-
veloping  countries.  The  share  of  the  popula-
tion of the developing world living on less than 
US$1.25 a day (in purchasing power parity) fell 
from 52 percent in 1981 to 22 percent in 2008, 
or  from  1.94  billion  people  to  1.29  billion.26  
This reduction is the result of multiple factors, 
but the creation of millions of new, more pro-
ductive  jobs,  mostly  in  Asia  but  also  in  other 
parts  of  the  developing  world,  has  been  the 
main driving force.27

Jobs are vulnerable to economic downturns, 
though, much more so in the private sector than 
the  public  sector.  Short-term  crises  may  wipe 
out years of progress. They may start in a single 
country but now, through globalization, spread 
over entire regions or to the world. The recent 
financial  crisis  created  22  million  new  unem-
ployed in a single year. Growth in total employ-
ment, hovering around 1.8 percent a year before 
2008, fell to less than 0.5 percent in 2009, and 
by 2011 had not yet reached its pre-crisis level.28

JOBS

Demography,  urbanization,  globalization, 
technology,  and  macroeconomic  crises  bring 
about  formidable  jobs  challenges.  Countries 
that fail to address them may fall into vicious 
circles  of  slow  growth  in  labor  earnings  and 
job-related  dissatisfaction  affecting  a  sizable 
portion of the labor force.30 Youth unemploy-
ment  and  idleness  may  be  high,  and  women 
may have fewer job opportunities, leaving po-
tential economic and social gains untapped.31 
A  repeating  pattern  of  small  gains  in  living 
standards, slow productivity growth, and erod-
ing  social  cohesion  can  set  in.  In  contrast, 
countries that address these jobs challenges can 
develop  virtuous  circles.  The  results—pros-
perous  populations,  a  growing  middle  class, 
increased  productivity,  and  improved  oppor-
tunities  for  women  and  youth—may  then  be 
self-reinforcing.

Development happens through jobs

Jobs are more than just the earnings and benefits 
they provide. They are also the output they gen-
erate, and part of who we are and how we interact 
with others in society. Through these outcomes, 

 

Moving jobs center stage

jobs can boost living standards, raise productiv-
ity, and foster social cohesion (figure 4). 

Jobs are what we earn 

Jobs  are  the  most  important  determinant  of 
living  standards.  For  most  people,  work  is  the 
main source of income, especially in the poorest 
countries. Many families escape or fall into pov-
erty because family members get or lose a job. 
Opportunities  for  gainful  work,  including  in 
farming and self-employment, offer households 
the means to increase consumption and reduce 
its  variability.  Higher  yields  in  agriculture,  ac-
cess  to  small  off-farm  activities,  the  migration 
of family members to cities, and transitions to 
wage employment are milestones on the path to 
prosperity.32 And as earnings increase, individ-
ual  choices  expand—household  members  can 
choose to stay out of the labor force or to work 
fewer hours and dedicate more time to educa-
tion, to retirement, or to family.

Earnings from work increase with economic 
development,  and  the  benefits  associated  with 
jobs  improve  as  well.  The  relationship  is  not 
mechanical, but growth is clearly good for jobs 
(figure  5).  Admittedly,  as  economies  become 
more  developed,  the  average  skills  of  jobhold-
ers  increase,  implying  that  observations  across 
countries are not strictly comparable, as they do 

not refer to identical workers. But growth also  
improves the living standards of workers whose 
skills have not changed. 

More than two decades of research on pov-
erty  dynamics,  spanning  countries  as  different 
as Canada, Ecuador, Germany, and South Africa, 
show that labor-related events trigger exits from 
poverty.33 These events range from the head of 
a household changing jobs to family members 
starting  to  work  and  to  working  family  mem-
bers earning more. Conversely, a lack of job op-
portunities  reduces  the  ability  of  households 
to  improve  their  well-being.34  In  a  large  set  of 
qualitative studies in low-income countries, get-
ting jobs and starting businesses were two of the 
main reasons for people to rise out of poverty.35
Quantitative  analysis  confirms  that  changes 
in labor earnings are the largest contributor to 
poverty reduction (figure 6). In 10 of 18 Latin 
American  countries,  changes  in  labor  income 
explain more than half the reduction in poverty, 
and in another 5 countries, more than a third. In 
Bangladesh, Peru, and Thailand, changes in edu-
cation, work experience, and region of residence 
mattered, but the returns to these characteristics 
(including labor earnings) mattered most. Just 
having  work  was  not  enough,  given  that  most 
people work in less developed economies. What 
made a difference for escaping poverty was in-
creasing the earnings from work.36

Note: Family composition indicates the change in the share of adults (ages 18 and older) within the household. Labor income refers to the change in employment and earnings for 
each adult. Nonlabor income refers to changes in other sources of income such as transfers, pensions, and imputed housing rents. If a bar is located below the horizontal axis, it 
means that that source would have increased, instead of decreased, poverty. The changes are computed for Argentina (2000–10); Bangladesh (2000–10); Brazil (2001–09);  Chile 
(2000–09); Colombia (2002–10); Costa Rica (2000–08); Ecuador (2003–10); El Salvador (2000-09); Ghana (1998–2005); Honduras (1999–2009); Mexico (2000–10); Moldova (2001–10); 
Panama (2001–09); Paraguay (1999–2010); Peru (2002–10); Nepal (1996–2003); Romania (2001–09); and Thailand (2000–09). The changes for Bangladesh, Ghana, Moldova, Nepal, 
Peru, Romania, and Thailand are computed using consumption-based measures of poverty, while the changes for the other countries are based on income measures.

Beyond  their  fundamental  and  immediate 
contribution to earnings, jobs also affect other 
dimensions of well-being, including mental and 
physical  health.  Not  having  a  job  undermines 
life  satisfaction,  especially  in  countries  where 
wage  employment  is  the  norm  and  where  the 
lack  of  opportunities  translates  into  open  un-
employment  rather  than  underemployment. 
Among those employed, the material, nonmate-
rial,  and  even  subjective  characteristics  of  jobs 
can  all  have  an  impact  on  well-being.37  Other 
features  such  as  workplace  safety,  job  security, 
learning  and  advancement  opportunities,  and 
health and social protection benefits are valued 
by  workers.  But  relatively  few  jobs  offer  these 
advantages in developing countries.

Jobs are what we do

Economic growth happens as jobs become more 
productive,  but  also  as  more  productive  jobs 

are  created  and  less  productive  jobs  disappear. 
These  gains  may  ultimately  be  driven  by  new 
goods, new methods of production and trans-
portation, and new markets, but they material-
ize  through  a  constant  restructuring  and  real-
location of resources, including labor.38 Net job 
creation  figures  hide  much  larger  processes  of 
gross job creation and gross job destruction. On 
average  across  developing  countries,  between  
7 and 20 percent of jobs in manufacturing are 
created within a year, but a similar proportion 
disappear (figure 7).39

Because economies grow as high-productivity 
jobs are created and low-productivity jobs dis-
appear,  the  relationship  between  productivity 
gains and job creation is not mechanical. In the 
medium term, employment trends align closely 
with  trends  in  the  size  of  the  labor  force,  so 
growth is truly jobless in very few cases. In the 
short term, however, innovations can be associ-
ated  with  either  increases  or  decreases  in  em-

 

Moving jobs center stage   

11

ployment.40 The popular perception is that pro-
ductivity grows through downsizing, but some 
firms are able to achieve both productivity and 
employment  gains.41  In  Chile,  Ethiopia,  and  
Romania,  successful  “upsizers”  contributed  to 
output  and  employment  growth  substantively; 
sometimes  they  are  more  numerous  than  the 
successful “down  sizers.”42 And the combination 
of  private  sector  vibrancy  and  state  sector  re-
structuring  led  to  rapid  output  and  employ-
ment  growth  in  transition  economies  and  in 
China in the late 1990s and the early 2000s.43 

Successful  upsizers  tend  to  be  younger, 
leaner, and more innovative.44 But overall, large 
firms are both more innovative and more pro-
ductive. They invest more in machinery. They 
are  much  more  likely  than  small  firms  to  de-
velop new product lines, to introduce new tech-
nology, to open and close plants, to outsource, 
and  to  engage  in  joint  ventures  with  foreign 
partners.45  These  firms  produce  more  with  a 
given amount of labor, and export more as well. 
They also pay substantively higher wages than 
micro- and small enterprises (figure 8). In de-
veloping countries, however, many people work 
in very small and not necessarily very dynamic 
economic units.

Family farms dominate in agriculture. At 1.8 
and 1.2 hectares, respectively, average farm size 
is  small  in  Sub-Saharan  Africa,  and  especially 
in Asia.46 The Green Revolution has led to both 
higher cereal yields and more job creation be-
cause the new technologies are labor intensive. 
But  progress  has  been  uneven  across  regions 
and has not taken place on a large scale in Sub- 
Saharan  Africa.  More  mechanized  farms  have 
higher  productivity,  but  constraints  in  land 
markets usually slow mechanization; without it, 
yields per hectare tend to be higher on smaller 
farms.

Outside  agriculture  there  are  massive 
 numbers  of  microenterprises  and  household 
businesses  (figure  9).  These  small  units  play 
significant  roles  in  job  creation,  even  in  high- 
middle-income  countries.  They  account  for  97 
percent  of  employment  in  the  manufacturing 
sector in Ethiopia, but still for a sizable 39 per-
cent in Chile. In the services sector, their role is 
often more important. Even in Eastern European 
countries, where the private sector is only two 
decades old, microenterprises are the source of 
10 to 20 percent of employment in manufactur-

rowly  defined  sectors,  a  manufacturing  plant 
at the 10th percentile of the distribution gener-
ates 22 times less output than a plant in the 90th 
percentile would produce with the same inputs. 
This  pattern  is  similar  in  a  number  of  Latin 
American countries. By comparison, the ratio is 
1 to 9 in the United States.47

While  microenterprises  have  lackluster  per-
formance as a group, they are also very diverse. 
Microenterprises and household businesses are a 
means of survival for the poor and a way of di-
versifying out of farming activities. On   average, 
their owners do not earn much.48 But in middle-
income  countries,  many  among  the  owners  of 
micro- and small enterprises are as entrepreneur-
ial  as  their  peers  in  industrial  countries.  Their 
weak  performance  may  be  due  to  an  adverse 
investment  environment—for  example,  limited 
access to credit.49 Yet a small number of micro-

enterprises, the gazelles, invest and earn higher 
returns.50

While large firms are more productive, they 
were not all born large. In industrial countries, 
some  of  the  more  resounding  successes,  from 
Honda  to  Microsoft,  started  in  garages.  Many 
successful  companies  in  developing  countries 
also  grew  out  of  small  household  businesses. 
Thailand’s Charoen Pokphand Group, founded 
in 1921 as a small seed shop in Bangkok by two 
brothers, has grown into one of the largest multi-
national conglomerates in agribusiness, operat-
ing in 15 countries and encompassing close to 
100 companies. India’s Tata Group transformed 
from  a  Mumbai-based  family-owned  trading 
firm in the late 19th century to a multinational 
conglomerate,  comprising  114  companies  and 
subsidiaries  across  eight  business  sectors  on 
 several  continents.  Many  of  China’s  success-
ful  clusters,  such  as  the  footwear  industry  in 
 Wenzhou, also started from small family busi-
nesses working close to each other.51

Unfortunately,  in  many  developing  coun-
tries, larger and older firms tend to be stagnant 
while smaller and younger enterprises are prone 
to churning. A vibrant dynamic process is usu-
ally  absent.  In  Ghana,  many  firms  were  born 
large and showed little growth over 15 years; in 
Portugal, by contrast, many firms born as mi-
croenterprises grew substantially.52 The major-
ity of firms in India is also born small, but they 
tend  to  stay  small,  without  displaying  much 
variation  in  employment  over  their  life  cycle.  
A  revealing  comparison  involves  the  size  of  
35-year old firms relative to their size at birth. 
In India, the size declines by a fourth; in Mex-
ico, it doubles. In the United States, it becomes 
10  times  bigger.53  The  potential  gains  from 
greater  entrepreneurial  vibrancy,  and  from  a 
more  substantial  reallocation  of  labor  from 
low-  to  high-productivity  units,  are  sizable.54 
But helping those gains materialize is a daunt-
ing task.

Jobs are who we are 

Having, or not having, a job can shape how peo-
ple view themselves and relate to others. While 
some jobs can be empowering, in extreme cases 
a lack of job opportunities can contribute to vi-
olence or social unrest. Youth may turn to gangs 
to  compensate  for  the  absence  of  identity  and 
belonging  that  a  job  might  provide.  In  Ecua-

dor, for instance, they did so “because they were 
searching for the support, trust, and cohesion—
social capital—that they maintained their fami-
lies did not provide, as well as because of the lack 
of opportunities in the local context.”55

The workplace can be a place to encounter 
new ideas and interact with people of different 
genders  or  ethnicities.  Bosnians  interviewed 
in the late 1990s commented that “the area in  
which there is the greatest support for ethnic co-
operation is in the workplace.”56 Business people 
in Trinidad and Tobago reported that they in-
teracted with people of a wider range of ethnic-
ities at work than they did in their social lives.57 
Networks can also exclude. In Morocco, people 

whose fathers did not have formal sector jobs  
were  significantly  less  likely  to  have  such  jobs 
themselves.58

The distribution of jobs within society—and 
perceptions  about  who  has  access  to  opportu-
nities and why—can shape expectations for the 
future  and  perceptions  of  fairness.  Children’s 
aspirations may be influenced by whether their 
parents  have  jobs  and  the  types  of  jobs  they 
have.  The  Arab  Spring  was  not  merely  about 
employment.  But  disappointment,  especially 
among youth, about the lack of job opportuni-
ties and frustration with the allocation of jobs 
based on connections rather than merit echoed 
across countries.

Jobs influence how people view themselves, 
how  they  interact  with  others,  and  how  they 
perceive  their  stake  in  society.59  Jobs  also  can 
have  collective  consequences.  They  can  shape 
how societies handle collective decision making, 
manage  tensions  between  diverse  groups,  and 
avoid  and  resolve  conflicts.  The  relationship  is 
not immediate or direct, however. Jobs are only 
one factor contributing to the capacity of socie-
ties to manage collective decision making peace-
fully. And social cohesion can in turn influence 
jobs by shaping the context in which entrepre-
neurs make business decisions. 

Trust beyond one’s own group and civic en-
gagement are two indicators of social cohesion. 
Unemployment and job loss are associated with 
lower levels of both trust and civic engagement 
(figure  10).  While  causality  is  difficult  to  es-
tablish, there is more than just a correlation at 
stake.  Indonesian  men  and  women  who  were 
working in 2000 but not in 2007 were less likely 
to be participating in community activities than 
those still at work. And those who were working 
in 2007 but not in 2000 were significantly more 
likely  to  be  involved  in  the  community  than 
those who were still out of work.60

The nature of jobs matters as well. Jobs that 
empower,  build  agency,  and  respect  rights  are 
associated with greater trust and willingness to 
participate in civil society. Jobs that create eco-
nomic  and  social  ties  may  build  incentives  to 
work  across  boundaries  and  resolve  conflict. 
And if people believe that job opportunities are 
available  to  them  either  now  or  in  the  future, 
their trust in others and their confidence in in-
stitutions may increase. Ultimately, jobs can in-
fluence social cohesion through their effects on 
social identity, networks, and fairness.

Valuing jobs

Not all forms of work are acceptable. Activities 
that exploit workers, expose them to dangerous 
environments,  or  threaten  their  physical  and 
mental  well-being  are  bad  for  individuals  and 
societies alike. Child prostitution and forced la-
bor contravene principles of human dignity and 
undermine individual and collective well-being. 
Today, an estimated 21 million people globally 
are victims of bonded labor, slavery, forced pros-
titution, and other forms of involuntary work.61 

 

Moving jobs center stage   

15

In 2008, 115 million children between the ages 
of 5 and 17 were involved in hazardous work.62 
International norms of human rights and labor 
standards reject forced labor, harmful forms of 
child labor, discrimination, and the suppression 
of voice among workers.

Beyond  rights,  the  most  obvious  outcome 
of a job is the earnings it provides to its holder. 
These  earnings  can  be  in  cash  or  in  kind  and 
may  include  a  range  of  associated  benefits. 
Other  characteristics,  such  as  stability,  voice, 
and  fulfillment  at  work,  also  affect  subjective 
well-being. Several of these dimensions of jobs 
have  been  combined  into  the  concept  of  De-
cent Work, introduced by the International La-
bour Organization (ILO) in 1999.63 Defined as 
“opportunities  for  women  and  men  to  obtain 
decent  and  productive  work  in  conditions  of 
freedom,  equity,  security  and  human  dignity,” 
this  concept  has  been  used  by  many  govern-
ments  to  articulate  their  policy  agendas  on 
jobs. The concept of Decent Work has also been 
embraced  by  the  United  Nations  and  several 
international  organizations  and  endorsed  by 
numerous global forums. 

As  jobs  provide  earnings,  generate  output, 
and  influence  identity,  they  shape  the  well-
being of those who hold them—and they also 
affect  the  well-being  of  others.  To  understand 
how much jobs contribute to development, it is 
necessary to assess these effects—the spillovers 
from jobs. Jobs that generate positive spillovers 
have  a  greater  value  to  society  than  they  have 
to  the  individual  who  holds  the  job,  while  the 
opposite is true when spillovers are negative. In-
tuitively, many people have notions about such 
broader payoffs. When asked about their most 
preferred jobs, respondents in China, Colombia, 
Egypt,  and  Sierra  Leone  give  different  answers 
from  those  they  offer  when  asked  to  identify 
the most important jobs to society (figure 11). 
Working as a civil servant or as a shop owner is 
generally preferred by individuals, while teach-
ers and doctors are quite often mentioned as the 
most important jobs for society. 

Who gets a job makes a difference too, and 
not just for individuals. In a society that values 
poverty  reduction,  jobs  that  take  households 
out  of  hardship  generate  a  positive  spillover, 
because  they  improve  the  well-being  of  those  
who care. Female employment also matters be-
yond the individual. An increase in the share of 

household  income  contributed  by  women  of-
ten results in improvements in children’s edu-
cational attainment and health. In Bangladesh, 
where  the  garment  industry  employs  women 
in  large  numbers,  the  opening  of  a  garment 
factory  within  commuting  distance  of  a  vil-
lage is seen as a signal of opportunity and leads  
to  increased  schooling  for  girls.64  Among  dis-
advantaged castes in Southern Indian villages, 
an increase of US$90 in a woman’s annual in-
come is estimated to increase schooling among 
her children by 1.6 years.65

Similarly, a job created or sustained through 
foreign  direct  investment  (FDI)  matters  for 
other jobs, and thus for other people. With the 
investment  come  knowledge  and  know-how. 
These raise productivity not only in the foreign 
subsidiary but also among local firms interact-
ing with the subsidiary or operating in its vicin-
ity. Such knowledge spillovers are sizable in low- 
and  middle-income  countries.66  Conversely,  a 
job in a protected industry that needs to be sup-
ported  through  transfers  (either  by  taxpayers 
or by consumers) generates a negative spillover, 
even  more  so  when  the  need  for  protection  is 
associated with the use of outdated technology 
that results in high environmental costs.

Jobs can also affect other people by shaping 
social values and norms, influencing how groups 
coexist  and  manage  tensions.  In  Bosnia  and  
Herzegovina and the former Yugoslav Republic 
of Macedonia, surveys found that the number of 
people willing to work together or do business 
with someone of a different ethnicity was greater 
than the number of people in favor of intereth-
nic cooperation in schools or neighborhoods.67 
And in the Dominican Republic, a program tar-
geted to youth at risk shows that jobs can change 
behaviors with positive implications for society. 
Participation  in  the  Programa  Juventud  y  Em-
pleo (Youth and Employment Program), which 
provides  a  combination  of  vocational  and  life 
skills  training,  reduced  involvement  in  gangs, 
violence, and other risky behaviors.68 

For the same level of earnings and benefits, 
the larger the positive spillovers from a job, the 
more transformational the job can be, and the 
greater its value to society. In everyday parlance, 
good  jobs  are  those  that  provide  greater  well-
being to the people who hold them. But good 
jobs for development are those with the highest 
value  for  society.  Understanding  these  wider

pay offs to jobs has shaped recent development 
thinking.69

Spillovers from jobs can be identified across 
all three transformations (figure 12). Some di-
rectly affect the earnings of others, as when a job 
is supported through government transfers, or 
restrictive regulations that reduce employment 
opportunities  for  others.  Other  spillovers  take 
place through interactions: in households in the 
case of gender equality, at the workplace when 
knowledge  and  ideas  are  shared,  or  in  society 
more broadly in the case of networks. Spillovers 
also occur when jobs and their allocation con-

tribute to common goals, such as poverty reduc-
tion, environmental protection, or fairness. 

Because  a  job  can  affect  the  well-being  of 
others as well as that of the jobholder, two jobs 
that  may  appear  identical  from  an  individual 
perspective could be different from a social per-
spective (figure 13). The individual perspective 
provides a useful starting point, because it often 
coincides  with  the  social  perspective.  A  high-
paying job in Bangalore’s information technol-
ogy sector is probably good for the worker; it is 
also good for India because it contributes to the 
country’s long-term growth. In other cases, the

17

two perspectives may conflict. For instance, Viet-
nam’s poverty rate declined with unprecedented 
speed in the 1990s when land was redistributed 
to  farmers  and  agricultural  commercialization 
was liberalized.70 From the individual perspec-
tive, farming jobs involve difficult working con-
ditions,  substantial  variability  in  earnings,  and 
no formal social protection. But they can make 
a major contribution to development, as a ticket 
out  of  poverty  for  many.  Conversely,  bloated 
public utilities often offer a range of privileges to 
their employees even if the utilities themselves 
provide  only  limited  coverage  and  unreliable 
services  and  are  obstacles  to  economic  growth 
and poverty reduction. Such jobs may look ap-
pealing from an individual perspective, but are 
less so to society.

Jobs  challenges  are  not  the  same  everywhere. 
Creating more jobs may be a universal goal, but 
the  types  of  jobs  that  can  contribute  the  most 
to development depend on the country context. 
Jobs that connect the economy to the world may 
matter  the  most  in  some  situations;  in  others, 

the  biggest  payoff  may  be  for  jobs  that  reduce 
poverty  or  defuse  conflict.  Certainly,  the  level 
of development matters. The jobs agenda is not 
the same in an agrarian economy as in one that 
is rapidly urbanizing. It is bound to be different 
still in countries already grappling with how far 
the formal economy can be extended.

But the nature of good jobs for development 
in a particular context is not simply a function 
of income per capita. It may be influenced by 
conflict  that  is  ongoing  or  still  reverberating. 
A  country’s  geography  or  its  natural  endow-
ments can also be determining factors. Small is-
land nations have unique jobs challenges, as do 
resource-rich economies. Or demography may 
be the key characteristic—witness the imposing 
but very different challenges in countries facing 
high youth unemployment and those with ag-
ing populations.

A typology of jobs challenges

A country’s level of development, institutional 
strength,  endowments,  and  demography  de-
fine  where  the  development  payoff  from  jobs 
is greatest. The jobs agenda in one country will 
thus be different from that in another country, 
depending  on  their  dominant  features.  The 
challenges facing countries as they move along 
the  development  path  are  illustrated  by  the 
agrarian, urbanizing, and formalizing cases:

•   Agrarian  countries.  Most  people  are  still  en-
gaged  in  agriculture  and  live  in  rural  areas. 
Jobs  that  improve  living  standards  have  a 
substantial  development  payoff  because  of 
high  poverty  rates.  Cities  need  to  be  more 
functional to reap the benefits from agglom-
eration  and  global  integration,  so  jobs  that 
set the foundation for cities to eventually be-
come  economically  dynamic  are  good  jobs 
for development. Even in the most optimistic 
scenario, however, it may take decades before 
urbanization  is  complete,  so  increasing  pro-
ductivity in agriculture is a priority.

•   Urbanizing countries. Productivity growth in 
agriculture has risen enough to free up large 
numbers  of  people  to  work  in  cities.  Job 
opportunities for women, typically in light 
manufacturing,  can  have  positive  impacts  
on  the  household  allocation  of  resources. 
Jobs  that  deepen  the  global  integration  of 
urbanizing  countries,  especially  in  higher-
value-added  export  sectors,  are  also  good 
for  development.  As  countries  urbanize, 
congestion,  pollution,  and  other  costs  of 
high density become increasingly serious, so 

jobs that do no environmental damage have 
particularly positive development impacts. 
•   Formalizing countries. Large and growing ur-
ban  populations  generally  lead  to  more  de-
veloped economies, where a fairly substantial 
proportion of firms and workers are covered 
by  formal  institutions  and  social  programs. 
But further increasing formality to levels typi-
cal  of  industrial  countries  involves  tradeoffs 
between  living  standards,  productivity,  and 
social  cohesion.  There  is  a  premium  on  jobs 
that can be formalized without making labor 
too costly and on jobs that reduce the divide 
between those who benefit from formal insti-
tutions and those who do not. 

In  some  countries,  the  jobs  challenge  is 
shaped  by  demography  and  special  circum-
stances affecting particular groups.
•    In  countries  with  high  youth  unemployment 
young  people  do  not  see  opportunities  for 
the future. Many of these countries have large 
youth bulges, which can put downward pres-
sure on employment and earnings. Many also 
have education and training systems that are 
not developing the kinds of skills needed by 
the  private  sector.  On  closer  inspection,  the 
problem  is  often  more  on  the  demand  side 
than  the  supply  side,  with  limited  compe-
tition  reducing  employment  opportunities, 
especially  in  more  skill-intensive  sectors.  In 
these settings, removing privilege in business 
entry and access to jobs is likely to have large 
development payoffs.

•   Aging  societies  also  face  generational  issues, 
but these stem from a shrinking working-age 
population  and  the  high  cost  of  providing 
and  caring  for  a  growing  number  of  elderly 
people. The impact of the declining working-
age population can be mitigated through pol-
icies for active aging, ensuring that the most 
productive  members  of  society,  including 
the highly skilled elderly, can work. Contain-
ing the increase in pension, health care, and 
long-term care costs can be achieved through 
reforms in program design, but these reforms 
can be a source of social strain. 

Natural  endowments,  including  geography, 
and institutions can create unique jobs challenges.

•   Resource-rich  countries  may  have  substantial 
foreign  exchange  earnings,  but  this  wealth 
may not translate into employment creation 
beyond the exploitation of natural resources. 
Indeed,  the  abundance  of  foreign  exchange 
can hamper the competitiveness of other ex-
port activities. Some resource-rich countries 
distribute part of their wealth through trans-
fers  or  subsidized  public  sector  jobs,  while 
relying on migrants to do menial work. This 
approach can maintain living standards but at 
the expense of productivity growth and social 
cohesion.  In  those  countries,  jobs  that  sup-
port  the  diversification  of  exports  can  have 
large development payoffs. 

•   Small island nations, because of their size and 
remoteness,  cannot  reap  the  benefits  from 
agglomeration and global integration except 
through  tourism.  So  the  productivity  spill-
overs  from  jobs  are  limited,  as  are  employ-
ment opportunities outside basic services and 
government.  Outmigration  offers  an  alter-
native  for  improving  living  standards,  while 
return migration and diaspora communities 
can  stimulate  the  diffusion  of  new  business 
ideas among locals. 

•    In conflict-affected countries, the most imme-
diate challenge is to support social cohesion. 
Employment  for  ex-combatants  or  young 
men  vulnerable  to  participation  in  violence 
takes  on  particular  importance. With  fragile 
institutions  and  volatile  politics,  attracting 
private investment and connecting to global 
value  chains  may  be  out  of  reach  for  quite 
some time. Yet construction can boom even 
in  poor  business  environments,  and  it  is  la-
bor  intensive.  Investments  in  infrastructure 
can not only support social cohesion through 
their direct employment impact, they can also 
be  a step in preparing for future private sector 
job creation.

These  criteria  are  not  mutually  exclusive. 
Chad and the Democratic Republic of Congo 
are  both  resource  rich  and  conflict  affected; 
Jordan and Armenia are formalizing and also 
have  high  youth  unemployment.  Still,  look-
ing through the jobs lens and focusing on the 
key features of the different country types can 
help  identify  more  clearly  the  kinds  of  jobs 

that  would  make  the  greatest  contribution  to 
development  in  each  case.  This  focus  allows 
for a richer analysis of the potential tradeoffs 
between  living  standards,  productivity,  and  
social  cohesion  in  a  specific  context.  It  pro-
vides clues about the obstacles to job creation 
and, ultimately, the priorities for policy makers 
(figure 14).

Migration of people—and of jobs

The movement of people and jobs implies that 
jobs  challenges,  while  being  country  specific, 
also  have  a  global  scope.  These  processes  have 
implications for living standards and productiv-
ity at both the sending and the receiving ends, 
and they can transform families and entire com-
munities, for better or for worse. Tradeoffs are 
inevitable, and coping with them only through 
the  policies  of  receiving  countries  alone  may 
prove unsatisfactory.

At  the  turn  of  the  21st  century,  there  were 
more  than  200  million  international  migrants 
worldwide,  nearly  90  million  of  them  work-
ers.  Many  migrants  are  temporary  or  seasonal 
workers  who  eventually  return  home.  Some 
countries are mainly recipients, while others are 
sources,  and  yet  others  neither  host  nor  send 
significant numbers of migrants (map 1). Some 
are large recipients either in absolute numbers 
(for  instance,  the  United  States)  or  in  relative 
terms  (Jordan  and  Singapore).  Migrants  from 
Bangladesh, Mexico, and India represent a large 
share of total migrants worldwide; Fiji, Jamaica, 
and Tonga have a large share of their population 
overseas. Figures for some of the smaller coun-
tries are striking. For instance, about a fifth of 
all Salvadorians live abroad, while more than 60 
percent of the populations of Kuwait, Qatar, and 
the United Arab Emirates are foreign-born.71

International  migration  increases  the  in-
comes  of  migrants  and  their  families  through 
earnings  and  remittances.  The  majority  of  the 
studies find either no effect or a very small nega-
tive effect on the labor earnings of locals in re-
ceiving  countries.  Migrants  also  contribute  to 
global  output  if  their  productivity  abroad  is 
higher than it would be at home, which is usually 
the case. They may even contribute to output in 
the  sending  country,  as  networks  of  migrants 
and returnees channel investments, innovation,

and  expertise.  Social  effects  are  more  mixed. 
On the positive side, migration connects people 
from different cultures in ways bound to widen 
their horizons. On the negative side, the separa-
tion from family and friends can be a source of 
distress and isolation. Migration may also bring 
racial prejudice and heighten social tensions in 
host countries, especially when migrants are se-
cluded  in  segregated  occupations  or  neighbor-
hoods, preventing their integration in society.

Jobs are on the move as well. The past four 
decades have been marked by the outsourcing of 
manufacturing  tasks  from  industrial  countries 
to the developing world, especially to East Asia 
(figure  15).  More  recently,  the  same  pattern  is 
observable for service tasks. In fact, services are 
the fastest-growing component of global trade. 
Developing  countries  are  now  exporting  not 
only traditional services, such as transportation 
and  tourism,  but  also  modern  and  skill-inten-
sive  services,  such  as  financial  intermediation, 

computer  and  information  services,  legal  and 
technical  support,  and  other  business  services. 
India  was  the  pioneer,  but  other  countries—
Brazil,  Chile,  China,  and  Malaysia,  to  name  a 
few—have also seized the opportunity.72

The obvious winners of job migration are the 
workers and entrepreneurs in countries to which 
industries and splintered service jobs have mi-
grated. This migration, along with the transfer 
of new technologies and advanced management 
methods,  contributes  to  productivity  growth 
and  higher  living  standards.  The  hidden  win-
ners of job migration are consumers worldwide. 
The improved international division of labor in-
creases the availability of goods and services and 
enhances the possibility of gaining from trade. 
The  clear  losers  are  those  who  have  seen  their 
jobs disappear because of the declining compet-
itiveness of their industries and services. Among 
the losers, many skilled workers find comparable 
jobs without a substantial loss in salary, but oth-

industry-  or  occupation-specific  skills  that  are 
no longer in demand are those who suffer most.

Policies through the jobs lens

While it is not the role of governments to create 
jobs, government functions are fundamental for 
sustained  job  creation.  The  quality  of  the  civil 

service is critically important for development, 
whether  it  is  teachers  building  skills,  agricul-
tural  extension  agents  improving  agricultural 
productivity, or urban planners designing func-
tional cities. Temporary employment programs 
for  the  demobilization  of  combatants  are  also 
justified in some circumstances. But as a general 
rule it is the private sector that creates jobs. The 
role of government is to ensure that the condi-
tions  are  in  place  for  strong  private-sector-led

growth, to understand why there are not enough 
good  jobs  for  development,  and  to  remove  or 
mitigate  the  constraints  that  prevent  the  cre-
ation of more of those jobs.

Government  can  fulfill  this  role  through  a 

three-layered policy approach (figure 16):
•   Fundamentals.  Because  jobs  improve  with 
development,  providing  higher  earnings  and 
benefits as countries grow rich, a prerequisite 
is to create a policy environment that is con-
ducive  to  growth.  Macroeconomic  stability, 
an  enabling  business  environment,  human 
capital accumulation, and the rule of law are 
among  the  fundamentals.  Ensuring  macro-
economic stability involves containing volatil-
ity and avoiding major misalignments of rela-
tive prices. Adequate infrastructure, access to 
finance, and sound regulation are key ingredi-
ents of the business environment. Good nutri-
tion, health, and education outcomes not only 
improve people’s lives but also equip them for 
productive  employment.  The  rule  of  law  in-
cludes protection of property rights and also 
the progressive realization of rights at work, to 
avoid a situation where growth co exists with 
unacceptable forms of employment.

•   Labor policies. Because growth does not me-
chanically deliver employment, a second layer 
is to ensure that labor policies do not under-
mine job creation and instead enhance the de-
velopment payoffs from jobs. But labor mar-
ket  imperfections  should  not  be  addressed 
through  institutional  failures.  Instead,  they 
should remain on a range—a plateau—where 
negative  efficiency  effects  are  modest.  Labor 
policy should avoid two cliffs: the distortion-
ary interventions that clog the creation of jobs 
in  cities  and  in  global  value  chains,  and  the 
lack of mechanisms for voice and protection 
for the most vulnerable workers, regardless of 
whether they are wage earners. The first cliff 
undermines  the  development  payoffs  from 
agglomeration  and  global  integration;  the 
second leads to low living standards and a so-
cial cohesion deficit. 

•   Priorities. Because some jobs do more for de-
velopment than others, it is necessary to un-
derstand  where  good  jobs  for  development 
lie, given the country context. More selective 
policy  interventions  are  justified  when  in-
centives are distorted, resulting in too few of 

 

Moving jobs center stage   

23

those jobs. If this is the case, policies should 
remove the market imperfections and institu-
tional failures that prevent the private sector 
from  creating  more  good  jobs  for  develop-
ment.  If  the  failures  and  imperfections  can-
not  be  clearly  identified,  or  cannot  be  easily 
removed, offsetting them may be an option, 
but the costs and benefits of doing so need to 
be carefully assessed.

Fundamentals: Ensuring the basics

Macroeconomic  stability.  Volatility  hurts  em-
ployment and earnings, often immediately. Ac-
cording to a recent estimate, a 1.0 percent decline 
in gross domestic product (GDP) is associated 
with  an  increase  in  the  unemployment  rate  of 
0.19 percentage point in Japan, 0.45 percentage 
point in the United States, and 0.85 percentage 
point in Spain.73 In developing countries, where 
farming and self-employment are more preva-
lent and income support mechanisms are more 
limited,  the  short-term  impact  of  macroeco-
nomic instability is less on open unemployment 
and more on earnings from work.74

Volatility  can  originate  internally  or  be 
caused by external shocks. Internally, it is often 
the  outcome  of  unsustainable  budget  deficits 
and lax monetary policy. But tight budgets and 
rigid monetary policy rules may not be a magic 
wand.  Budget  deficits  are  more  or  less  worri-
some depending on how quickly an economy is 
growing,  whereas  the  independence  of  central 
banks  needs  to  be  weighed  against  the  overall 
coherence  of  the  country’s  development  strat-
egy. Assessing the soundness of macroeconomic 
management  requires  taking  account  of  the 
impact of fiscal and monetary policies on eco-
nomic growth.75

Volatility may also result from external shocks, 
including  natural  disasters  and  crises  originat-
ing  abroad.  Precautionary  policies  can  cushion 
those shocks, if and when they occur. Most often, 
short-term stimulus or adjustment packages are 
needed—but these tend to be less effective in the 
developing  world  than  in  developed  countries 
because of lower multiplier effects.76

Avoiding exchange rate misalignment is nec-
essary  to  sustain  a  vibrant  export  sector—and 
thus  to  create  jobs  connected  to  international 
markets  and  global  value  chains.  Surges  in  a 
country’s  foreign  exchange  earnings  generally

lead to an overvaluation of its currency, making 
imports more affordable and exports less com-
petitive.  Resource-rich  countries  face  similar 
pressures for their currencies to appreciate, and 
the commodity booms of the last few years have 
only  made  these  pressures  stronger.  Currency 
overvaluation  can  also  happen  in  countries 
where  large  volumes  of  foreign  assistance  are 
needed  to  jump-start  development,  cope  with 
natural  disasters,  or  facilitate  recovery  after  a 
conflict. An analysis of 83 developing countries 
between 1970 and 2004 confirms that aid fosters 
growth (albeit with decreasing returns) but in-
duces overvaluation and has a negative impact 
on export diversification.77

An  enabling  business  environment.  Finance, 
infrastructure, and business regulations set the 
quality  of  the  investment  climate  and  thus  in-
fluence job creation by private firms. Access to 
finance,  a  chief  constraint  to  business  expan-
sion  in  countries  in  every  development  phase, 
is the top constraint in low- and upper-middle-
income countries (figure 17). Financial markets 
have the potential to allocate resources toward 
more  productive  uses,  thwart  the  channeling 
of resources to those with political connections 
or  economic  power,  and  expand  financial  in-

clusion.  But  regulatory  oversight  is  needed  to 
ensure  transparency   and  competition  in  how 
funds are allocated.78 The financial crisis of 2008 
reopened  heated  debates  on  the  appropriate 
regulation of the financial sector and the need 
to balance prudence and stability with innova-
tion and inclusion. 

Access to affordable and quality infrastruc-
ture is a prerequisite for firms to operate. Power 
shortages  are  the  number-two  constraint  to 
firm  growth  and  job  creation  mentioned  by 
entrepreneurs  the  world  over—and  number 
one in low-income countries. Telecommunica-
tions allow for a better flow of information with 
suppliers and customers, and the internet and 
mobile technology facilitate the spread of new 
ideas. Roads provide greater access to markets, 
as do ports and airports.79 The way infrastruc-
ture  is  regulated  is  important  as  well.  Inad-
equate pricing policies and regulations amplify 
the  gap  in  needed  infrastructure  services.  In 
many  countries,  monopolies  based  on  politi-
cal connections have led to reduced quantities 
of  infrastructure  services  at  higher  prices  and 
lower quality.80 

Business  regulation  also  affects  the  oppor-
tunities for businesses to grow and create jobs. 
Regulations can increase the cost of doing busi-
ness,  in  money  or  in  time  needed  to  comply. 
Steps taken to meet requirements or to pay fees 
are a burden for businesses, as are delays or dis-
cretionary decisions, such as those for permits 
or licenses. There is great variation across firms 
in the same location with regard to the time it 

takes  to  comply  with  regulations  or  to  receive 
permits.81 Business regulations also affect com-
petition and thus the pressure to innovate and 
increase productivity. Across countries, regula-
tions on business entry are inversely correlated 
with productivity and firm creation, with stron-
ger  effects  in  sectors  that  have  higher  rates  of 
entry.82  In  Mexico,  easing  entry  requirements 
increased  business  registration  and  employ-
ment and drove down consumer prices, largely 
through creating new firms rather than formal-
izing informal firms.83

Human capital. Good outcomes in nutrition, 
health,  and  education  are  development  goals 
in  themselves,  because  they  directly  improve 
people’s  lives.  But  they  also  equip  people  for 
productive  employment  and  job  opportuni-
ties—and  through  this  channel,  human  capi-
tal drives economic and social advances. There 
is  robust  evidence  from  throughout  the  world 
that an additional year of schooling raises earn-
ings  substantially,  and  that  this  earnings  pre-
mium reflects the higher productivity of more 
educated workers.84 Together, nutrition, health, 
and  education  combine  to  form  human  skills 
and abilities that have been powerfully linked to 
productivity  growth  and  poverty  reduction  in 
the medium to longer run.85 Also, better health 
brings,  directly,  higher  labor  productivity.  As 
such, human capital is a fundamental ingredi-
ent for desirable job outcomes. 

Human  capital  formation  is  cumulative.  
Of  crucial  importance  are  adequate  health 
and  nutrition  during  “the  first  1,000  days,”

from  conception  to  two  years  of  age.  Brain 
devel opment in this time period affects physi-
cal  health,  learning  abilities,  and  social  be-
havior  throughout  life.86  Ensuring  adequate 
nutrition,  health,  and  cognitive  stimulation 
through  a  nurturing  environment  from  the 
womb through the first years raises returns to 
later  child  investments  significantly.87  While 
foundations  are  laid  early  on,  human  capital 
and  skills  continue  to  be  formed  throughout 
childhood  and  young  adulthood.  School-
ing  is  fundamental  for  the  further  develop-
ment  of  cognitive  and  social  skills  until  the 
end  of  the  teenage  life.  Social  skills  remain 
malleable  through  adolescence  and  the  early 
adult  years.88  Young  adults  can  continue 
into  more  specialized  skill-building,  includ-
ing  at  tertiary  levels,  but  success  depends  on 
whether  the  generic  skills  needed  to  learn 
and  adapt  to  different  tasks  and  problem- 
solving  environments  have  been  acquired. 
These general skills are especially important in 
more dynamic economic environments.

Unfortunately, the evidence shows that many 
countries  are  falling  short  in  building  up  the 
human capital of their children and youth. The 
quality  of  delivery  systems  has  often  failed  to 
keep pace with the expansion of access to basic 
social  services.  In  a  large  majority  of  develop-
ing countries that took part in the Programme 
for International Student Assessment (PISA) in 
2009, at least one-fifth of 15-year-old students 
were functionally illiterate (not reaching at least 
level 2 in the PISA reading assessment).89

The  rule  of  law.  Across  countries,  the  pres-
ence of institutions that protect property rights, 
uphold the rule of law, and rein in corruption is 
associated with higher levels of development.90 
Property rights foster private sector growth by 
allowing  firms  to  invest  without  the  fear  that 
their assets will be stolen or confiscated.91 The 
ability  to  enforce  contracts  widens  the  circle 
of  potential  suppliers  and  customers,  as  per-
sonal  connections  become  less  important  in 
establishing  trust.92  The  rule  of  law  has  direct 
implications  for  the  growth  of  firms  and  jobs. 
Entrepreneurs who believe their property rights 
are  secure  reinvest  more  of  their  profits  than 
those who do not.93 Conversely, rampant crime 
and violence are likely to drive firms away and 
discourage  domestic  and  foreign  investment.94 
Across  countries,  investment  climate  surveys 

consistently find crime and corruption to be ob-
stacles to conducting business.95 

An effective judicial system is a key institu-
tion  for  enforcing  property  rights  and  reduc-
ing  crime  and  corruption.  An  independent, 
accountable,  and  fair  judiciary  can  contribute 
to private sector growth and job creation by en-
forcing  the  rules  that  govern  transactions  and 
by helping ensure that the costs and benefits of 
growth are fairly distributed. The justice system 
can enforce contracts, reduce transaction costs 
for firms, and create a safe and more predictable 
business environment.96 And effective courts in-
crease the willingness of firms to invest.97 

An  institutional  environment  that  respects 
rights is an important ingredient of the rule of 
law and a foundation for good jobs for develop-
ment. The ILO’s core labor standards provide a 
floor  in  the  areas  of  child  labor,  forced  labor, 
discrimination,  and  freedom  of  association 
and  collective  bargaining.98  Health  and  safety 
at work also call for attention by governments 
and  employers.  Ensuring  that  standards  are 
applied in practice requires providing access to 
information to workers and employers. It also 
implies expanding legal coverage to workers in 
jobs  that  fall  outside  formal  laws  and  regula-
tions.  Associations  of  informal  workers  can 
inform them about their rights, help them use 
legal  mechanisms,  and  offer  them  collective 
voice.99

Labor policies: Avoiding the two cliffs

A  malfunctioning  labor  market  may  prevent 
economic  growth  from  translating  into  more 
and  better  jobs.  Traditional  analyses  focus  on  
labor supply, labor demand, and their matching 
to explain why there may not be enough employ-
ment, or not enough wage employment in the 
case of developing countries. By not addressing 
labor market imperfections, or by creating them, 
labor policies can indeed constrain job creation, 
even seriously. In many cases, however, the con-
straints to creating transformational jobs are not 
connected to the labor code. The low productiv-
ity  of  smallholder  farming  in  agrarian  econo-
mies is probably more closely related to failures 
in agricultural research and extension. And the 
lack of competition in technologically advanced 
activities that could boost the demand for skilled 
work  in  countries  with  high  youth  unemploy-

26 

  WO R L D   D E V E LO P M E N T   R E P O RT   2 0 1 3

ment is more likely to stem from cronyism and 
political favoritism.

There  is  no  consensus  on  what  the  content 
of labor policies should be. Views are polarized, 
reflecting differences in fundamental beliefs. To 
some,  labor  market  regulations  and  collective 
bargaining  are  sources  of  inefficiency  that  re-
duce output and employment, while protecting 
insiders at the expense of everyone else. In this 
view, unemployment insurance and active labor 
market programs create work disincentives and 
are a waste of money. To others, these policies 
provide necessary protection to workers against 
the power of employers and the vagaries of the 
market. They can even contribute to economic 
efficiency  by  improving  information,  insuring 
against risks, and creating conditions for long-
term investments by both workers and firms.

Advocates  of  both  views  can  find  examples 
to support their positions. Those who see labor 
policies and institutions as part of the problem 
point to the impressive long-term job creation 
record of the United States, a country with lim-
ited interventions in the labor market. They also 
point  to  the  protective  job  security  rules  that 
have impeded young people from finding work 
in many North African and Southern European 
countries. By contrast, those who see labor poli-
cies as part of the solution point to job-sharing 
as  decisive  in  Germany’s  relative  success  in 
weathering the financial crisis.

A careful review of the actual effects of labor 
policies in developing countries yields a mixed 
picture. Most studies find that impacts are mod-
est—certainly  more  modest  than  the  intensity 
of the debate would suggest.100 Across firm sizes 
and country levels of development, labor poli-
cies and regulations are generally not among the 
top three constraints that formal private enter-
prises  face.  Excessive  or  insufficient  regulation 
of  labor  markets  reduces  productivity.  But  in 
between  these  extremes  is  a  plateau  where  ef-
fects enhancing and undermining efficiency can 
be  found  side  by  side  and  most  of  the  impact 
is  redistributive,  generally  to  the  advantage  of 
middle-aged male workers (as opposed to own-
ers of capital, women, and younger workers). 

In  most  countries  that  have  been  studied, 
job  security  rules  and  minimum  wages  have  a 
small  effect  on  aggregate  employment.  These 
rules  offer  benefits  for  those  who  are  covered, 
while negative effects tend to be concentrated on 

youth, women, and the less skilled. In Colombia 
and  Indonesia,  minimum  wage  increases  had 
only a modest overall effect but the employment 
impact was stronger for young workers.101 Reg-
ulations  more  clearly  affect  job  flows,  creating 
“stickiness” in the labor market and slowing the 
pace of labor reallocation. 102 While this hinders 
economic  efficiency,  the  evidence  on  produc-
tivity  is  fairly  inconclusive,  though  admittedly 
scarce.103 

In developing countries, collective bargain-
ing  does  not  have  a  major  impact  outside  the 
public  sector  and  activities  characterized  by 
limited  competition,  where  there  are  rents  to 
share.104  Unions  consistently  raise  wages  for 
workers. Studies place this premium in the 5 to 
15 percent range in Mexico; around 5 percent 
in Korea; and at 10 to 20 percent in South Af-
rica.105 The costs in terms of reduced jobs are 
not so clear, however. In some countries, though 
not all, the tradeoff seems to be lower employ-
ment,  but  even  then  the  magnitudes  are  rela-
tively small. The limited evidence on union ef-
fects on productivity is also mixed.106 The main 
challenges are extending voice to those who are 
not wage earners, so that the constraints facing 
their  farms  and  microenterprises  can  be  ad-
dressed, and organizing collective bargaining in 
a way that enhances productivity.

Active labor market programs, such as train-
ing,  employment  services,  wage  subsidies,  and 
public works, have a mixed record.107 When they 
are not well grounded in the needs and realities 
of the labor market or when administration is 
poor and not transparent, they are of little use 
or even worse. When they are well designed and 
implemented, they can help facilitate job match-
ing, mitigate the negative impacts of economic 
downturns,  and  fill  the  gap  when  employers 
or workers underinvest in training (figure 18). 
Even when this is the case, though, effects tend 
to be modest, so expectations about what active 
labor  market  policies  can  achieve  need  to  be 
held in check.

Social insurance coverage is limited even in 
the most formalized developing countries. Un-
employment insurance can help workers man-
age the risks of job loss, but it can also weaken 
job search efforts. When unemployment insur-
ance,  pensions,  health  care,  and  other  benefits 
are  financed  through  the  payroll,  high  contri-
bution  rates  can  create  hiring  disincentives.  In

developing  countries  where  formal  sectors  are 
small, funding these programs through general 
taxation  is  increasingly  discussed,108  but  any 
taxes create distortions. In the end, there is no 
substitute  for  affordable  social  protection  ben-
efits that are valued by workers. The main issue 
is  coherently  integrating  social  protection  and 
social assistance to minimize gaps and overlaps.
In  sum,  labor  policies  and  institutions  can 
improve  labor  market  information,  manage 
risk,  and  provide  voice.  But  these  advantages 
can  come  at  the  expense  of  labor  market  dy-
namism,  reduced  incentives  for  job  creation 
and  job  search,  and  a  gap  in  benefits  between 
the covered and uncovered. The challenge is to 
set labor policies on a plateau—a range where 
regulations and institutions can at least partially 
address  labor  market  imperfections  without 
reducing  efficiency.  Labor  market  rules  that 
are too weak or programs that are too modest 
or  nonexistent  can  leave  problems  of  poor  in-
formation, unequal power, and inadequate risk 
management  untreated.  In  contrast,  rules  that 
are too stringent and programs that are too am-
bitious  can  compound  market  imperfections 
with institutional failures.

The focus on good jobs for development of-
fers some insights to assess where the edges of 
the plateau, the cliffs, may lie. At one end of the 
plateau are labor policies that slow job creation 
in  cities,  or  in  global  value  chains,  and  make 
countries miss out on jobs supporting agglom-
eration effects and knowledge spillovers. Forgo-
ing the development payoffs from urbanization 
and global integration would be a consequence 
of falling off the cliff. This is not necessarily an 
argument for minimum regulation. There is also 
scope  for  arrangements  strengthening  spatial 
coordination, and thus increasing efficiency, as 
suggested by China’s recent experience with col-
lective bargaining.

At the other end of the plateau, the absence 
of  mechanisms  for  voice  and  protection  for 
those who do not work for an employer, or do so 
in the informal sector, is also a concern. Extend-
ing voice for workers who are often among the 
poorest  may  result  in  higher  living  standards. 
Limiting  abuses  by  employment  intermediar-
ies should enhance efficiency, and building in-
clusive social protection systems can contribute 
to  greater  social  cohesion.  The  experience  of

ket rigidity, but it is no less real. 

Priorities: Realizing the development 
payoffs from jobs

In  addition  to  ensuring  that  the  fundamen-
tals support growth and that labor policies are 
 adequate,  decision  makers  can  help  realize  the 
development payoffs that come from jobs. Some 
jobs  do  more  than  others  for  living  standards, 
productivity,  and  social  cohesion.  What  those 
jobs  are  depends  on  the  country  context—its 
level  of  development,  demography,  endow-
ments, and institutions. In some circumstances, 
there will be no constraints to the emergence of 
good jobs for development, and no specific pol-
icy will be needed. In others, governments can 
support  the  private  sector  in  creating  more  of 
these jobs. Sometimes this can be achieved by re-
moving constraints that impede the creation of 
jobs with high development payoffs. When this 
is  not  possible,  policies  can  be  more  proactive 
and  bypass  the  constraints,  provided  that  the 
gains to society from doing so outweigh the cost.

A simple approach to setting policy priorities 

follows five steps (figure 19):
•   Step one: What are good jobs for development? 
Assessing  the  development  payoffs  from  
jobs in a particular country context is the first 
step  in  identifying  priorities.  The  nature  of 
those  jobs  varies  with  the  characteristics  of 
the  country,  including  its  phase  of  develop-
ment,  demography,  endowments,  and  insti-
tutions.  Jobs  challenges  are  not  the  same  in 
agrarian economies, resource-rich countries, 
conflict-affected  countries,  or  in  countries 
with high youth unemployment. And the jobs 
with  the  greatest  development  impact  differ 
as well, resulting in diverse jobs agendas. 

•   Step  two:  Are  there  enough  of  these  jobs?  A 
country  may  or  may  not  face  constraints  in 
creating good jobs for development. For ex-
ample, light manufacturing can offer employ-
ment opportunities for women, with signifi-
cant impacts on poverty. If a boom is under 
way, the development value of new manufac-
turing  jobs  might  materialize.  But  it  might 
not if, for example, inadequate urbanization 
policies limit the establishment of new firms. 

In the absence of gaps of this sort, it is difficult 
to  justify  government  interventions  beyond 
establishing  the  fundamentals  and  adopting 
adequate labor policies. 

Data  and  analysis  can  be  used  to  iden-
tify  misaligned  incentives,  indicated  by  a 
gap  between  the  individual  and  the  social 
value of jobs. Several research areas deal with 
these  gaps.  For  instance,  the  tools  of  pub-
lic  finance  can  measure  the  tax  burden  that  
applies to capital and labor and assess the cross- 
subsidization  between  individuals  or  firms. 
The methods of labor economics can uncover 
gaps  between  the  actual  earnings  of  specific 
groups of workers and their potential earnings, 
or between the social and individual returns to 
schooling. Poverty analyses help in identifying 
the kind of jobs that are more likely to provide 
opportunities  to  the  poor,  or  the  locations 
where  job  creation  would  have  a  greater  im-
pact  on  reducing  poverty.  Productivity  stud-
ies  allow  for  quantifying  the  spillovers  from 
employment  in  foreign-owned  investment 
companies, or in cities. Environmental studies 
shed light on the carbon footprint and pollu-
tion created by various types of jobs. And val-

 

Moving jobs center stage   

29

ues  surveys  can  discover  which  types  of  jobs 
provide social networks and social identity.

•   Step  three:  Can  the  constraints  be  identified? 
The  gaps  between  the  individual  and  social 
values  of  specific  types  of  jobs  indicate  un-
exploited spillovers from jobs. The gaps typi-
cally arise from market imperfections and in-
stitutional failures that cause people to work 
in jobs that are suboptimal from a social point 
of view, lead firms to create jobs that are not 
as good for development as they should be, or 
connect people less through jobs than would 
be  socially  desirable.  But  identifying  those 
constraints  is  not  always  easy.  For  instance, 
a broad set of cultural, social, and economic 
forces may result in insufficient employment 
opportunities  for  women.  Similarly,  the  ob-
stacles to more jobs in cities could be in the 
land market, or in the institutional arrange-
ments  to  coordinate  urban  development, 
or  in  the  ability  to  raise  revenue  to  finance 
infrastructure.

•   Step  four:  Can  the  constraints  be  removed?  If 
the  institutional  failures  and  market  imper-
fections leading to misaligned incentives can 
be identified, reforms should be considered. It 
is a good economic principle to target reforms 
on the failures and imperfections at the root 
of the problem. Where reforms are technically 
and politically feasible, policy makers can di-
rectly tackle the major constraints hindering 
the creation of more good jobs for develop-
ment by the private sector. 

•   Step five: Can the constraints be offset?  Reforms 
might not be feasible, technically or politically. 
Or  perhaps  the  constraints  for  jobs  are  not 
identifiable.  An  alternative  then  is  to  adopt 
offsetting policies that can restore the incen-
tives  for  job  creation.  For  instance,  if  a  dif-
fuse but entrenched set of norms and beliefs 
makes it difficult for women to work, efforts 
could  aim  at  increasing  their  employability 
through  targeted  investments  in  social  and 
physical  infrastructure  (box  1).  Similarly,  if 
politically charged regulations slow down the 
reallocation of labor toward more productive 
activities,  urban  infrastructure  and  logistics 
could  enhance  the  attractiveness  of  jobs  in 
cities and jobs connected to world markets.

But there are cases when constraints can nei-
ther be removed nor offset. An engagement strat-
egy  involving  a  deeper  analysis  of  the  options 
and buy-in by key stakeholders is needed then. 

Policy making to remove or offset constraints 
needs  to  be  selective  and  supported  by  good 
public finance principles. The costs and benefits 
of policy options need to be assessed, but calcu-
lations  are  different  when  the  overall  develop-
ment  impact  is  the  guiding  objective.  An  em-
ployment program to demobilize ex-combatants 
in a  conflict-affected country could be assessed 
in terms of whether the earnings gains of par-
ticipants  justify  the  program  costs,  but  a  full 
 accounting  should  also  incorporate  the  poten-
tially  positive  effects  from  reintegration  and 
peace building. In the Democratic Republic of 
Congo, the cost of an integration program for 
ex-combatants  was  about  US$800  per  benefi-
ciary.110 Such a program would likely be judged 
as  cost  inefficient  by  traditional  standards. 
Whether  or  not  it  is  still  worth  implementing 
depends on the value policy makers attach to so-
cial cohesion benefits. These benefits should be 
stated for the policy decision to be transparent.

Diverse jobs agendas, diverse policy 
priorities

Some  countries  have  successfully  set  policy  to 
bring out the development payoffs from jobs, in 
ways that provide a model to others.

As  an  agrarian  country,  in  the  1990s  Viet-
nam  concentrated  on  increasing  productivity 
in  agriculture,  freeing  labor  to  work  in  rural 
off-farm  employment  and  eventually  support-
ing  migration  to  cities.  In  1993,  more  than  70 
percent  of  employment  was  in  agriculture,  58 
percent of the population lived in poverty, and 
famine was still a real concern.111 Two decades 
later,  Vietnam  is  the  second-largest  exporter 
of rice and coffee; the largest exporter of black 
pepper and cashew nuts; and a top exporter of 
tea,  rubber,  and  seafood  products.  Poverty  has 
declined dramatically. Combined with a strong 
emphasis on agricultural extension, land reform 
and  deregulation  led  to  rapidly  growing  agri-
cultural productivity on very small farm plots. 
These  policies  were  part  of  a  broader  package 
of reforms, or Doi Moi, that took Vietnam from 
central  planning  to  a  market  economy  with  a 
socialist  orientation.112  Policies  also  aimed  at

BOX 1    How does women’s labor force participation increase?

Some developing countries have experienced important increases 
in women’s labor participation over a relatively short period of time. 
Nowhere has the change been faster than in Latin America. Since 
the  1980s,  more  than  70  million  women  have  entered  the  labor 
force, raising the female labor participation rate from 36 percent to 
43 percent. In Colombia, the rate increased from 47 percent in 1984 
to  65  percent  in  2006.  By  contrast,  in  the  Middle  East  and  North 
Africa,  women’s  labor  force  participation  has  only  grown  by  0.17 
percentage points per year over the last three decades. 

Recent research attributes this rapid transformation to increases 
in  labor  force  participation  among  married  or  cohabiting  women 
with children, rather than to demographics, education, or business 
cycles.  Changes  in  social  attitudes  contributed  to  the  transforma-
tion, but this is a complex area with limited scope—and justifica-
tion—for direct policy intervention. For instance, women’s partici-
pation  rates  are  very  low  in  the  West  Bank  and  Gaza,  particularly 
among married women. But this cannot be mechanically attributed 
to religion, as countries like Indonesia have high participation rates. 
Other social norms and regulations prevent women from participat-
ing, despite their willingness and capacity to do so. 

While the scope to influence social attitudes is limited, evidence 
suggests that public policies and programs in other areas have an 
important  role  to  play.  It  also  suggests  that  a  combination  of  tar-
geted  investments  and  interventions  in  social  and  physical  infra-
structure  can  modify  women’s  labor  force  participation  and  the 

returns to their earnings. These investments can be categorized into 
three groups. They can address shortages in the availability of ser-
vices (such as lack of electricity or daycare facilities) that force women 
to  allocate  large  amounts  of  time  to  home  production.  They  can 
make  it  easier  for  women  to  accumulate  productive  assets,  such  
as  education,  capital,  and  land,  facilitating  their  entry  into  high- 
productivity market activities. And they can remove norms or regula-
tions that imply biased or even discriminatory practices, preventing 
women from having equal employment opportunities. 

There  are  successful  experiences  with  targeted  investments 
and interventions of each of these three sorts. Public provision or 
subsidization  of  child  care  can  reduce  the  costs  women  incur  at 
home when they engage in market work. Examples include pub-
licly provided or subsidized day care such as Estancias Infantiles in 
Mexico, Hogares Comunitarios in Colombia, and similar programs 
in Argentina and Brazil. Improvements in infrastructure services—
especially  in  water  and  electricity—can  free  up  women’s  time 
spent  on  domestic  and  care  work.  Electrification  in  rural  South 
Africa,  for  instance,  has  increased  women’s  labor  force  participa-
tion by about 9 percent. Correcting biases in service delivery insti-
tutions, such as the workings of government land distribution and 
registration  schemes,  allows  women  to  own  and  inherit  assets. 
Finally,  the  use  of  active  labor  market  policies,  the  promotion  of 
networks, and the removal of discriminatory regulations are impor-
tant to make work more rewarding for women.

creating employment opportunities outside ag-
riculture. The country opened to foreign inves-
tors,  first  in  natural  resource  exploitation  and 
light manufacturing, and then more broadly in 
the context of its accession to the World Trade 
Organization in 2007. Registered FDI increased 
fourfold  in  just  two  years,  from  1992  to  1994; 
over the past five years, FDI inflows exceeded 8 
percent of GDP.113 

Rwanda,  a  conflict-affected  country,  has  re-
bounded after the ethnic conflict and destruction 
of  the  mid-1990s.  By  2000,  Rwanda’s  economy 
had returned to precrisis levels as a result of the 
cessation of conflict as well as an aggressive pack-
age of reforms.114 Growth has continued, reach-
ing  an  estimated  8.8  percent  in  2011,  and  the 
poverty rate fell by 12 percentage points between 
2005 and 2010. In the wake of the conflict, the 
government supported the reintegration and de-
mobilization of more than 54,000 former com-
batants.  In  2012,  73  percent  of  ex-combatants 

expressed  satisfaction  with  their  social  integra-
tion,  and  85  percent  of  community  members  
felt  there  was  trust  between  the  two  groups.115 
While ex-combatants were only a small share of 
Rwanda’s population of 10 million, their reinte-
gration had payoffs for social cohesion. Rwanda 
has built on this start by rejuvenating the private 
sector through reforms of institutions and busi-
ness regulations.116 The coffee industry has cre-
ated thousands of new jobs.117 

Chile,  a  resource-rich  country,  has  managed 
its copper riches in a way compatible with job 
creation in nonresource sectors. Home to more 
than  a  quarter  of  the  world’s  copper  reserves, 
Chile  diversified  its  exports  and  its  economy 
while  effectively  managing  resource-related 
risks  such  as  currency  appreciation  and  infla-
tion.  Unemployment  fell  to  single  digits  from 
around  20  percent  in  the  early  1980s.118 A  re-

lowed the country to save for difficult times and 
avoid a loss of competitiveness. Governance re-
forms in all areas of public sector management 
promoted  accountability  and  transparency. An 
active export-oriented growth policy, including 
the welcoming of foreign investment, supported 
productivity  spillovers  from  jobs  connected  to 
global  markets.  Competitive  innovation  funds 
for  nonmineral  export  sectors,  especially  in 
agribusiness, have broadened the export base.119 
The public budget boosted education spending, 
which almost doubled between 1990 and 2009, 
leading to an unprecedented expansion of sec-
ondary and tertiary education.120

Slovenia has successfully tackled its very high 
youth unemployment rate, reducing the ratio of 
youth  to  adult  unemployment  from  three  in  
the 1990s to around two today.121 The success 
in  reducing  youth  unemployment  cannot  be 
 attributed to spending on active labor market 
programs (about average for transition coun-
tries),  liberalizing  the  labor  market  (rules  re-
main more restrictive than the average in de-
veloped  countries),  or  low  minimum  wages 
(still on the high side).122 Potential distortions 
from these policies seem to be somewhat off-
set,  however,  by  a  model  of  consensus-based 
decision  making  whereby  trade  unions  and 
employer  organizations,  with  broad  coverage, 
set wages that respond well to macroeconomic 
trends  and  sectoral  productivity.123  Sustained 
growth  before  the  global  crisis  is  ultimately 
responsible  for  much  of  Slovenia’s  decline  in 
youth  unemployment.  Taking  advantage  of 
European  integration,  the  economy  success-
fully restructured its export sector. Very good 
infrastructure  and  a  fairly  well-skilled  work-
force helped as well.

Examples  of  successful  policies  can  actu-
ally be found across the entire typology of jobs 
challenges (figure 20). As an urbanizing coun-
try, Korea carefully designed and phased poli-
cies to accompany the transition of jobs from 
agriculture  to  light  manufacturing  and  then 
to industries with higher value added.124 Land 
 development  programs  were  established  first, 
followed by a land-use regulation system, and 
then by comprehensive urban planning. Hous-
ing  and  transportation  policies  held  the  dis-
economies  of  urbanization  in  check.  Tonga,  a 
small island nation, is actively using the Recog-
nized Seasonal Employer program launched by 

New Zealand in 2007 to provide employment 
opportunities  through  migration,  leading  to 
higher  remittances,  improved  knowledge  of 
agricultural  techniques,  computer 
literacy, 
and English-language skills.125 Brazil provides 
an  example  of  a  rapidly  formalizing  country. 
Over the past decade, job creation in the for-
mal sector has been three times as rapid as in 
the informal sector. Just in the five years lead-
ing  up  to  the  crisis,  the  formal  share  of  total 
employment  increased  by  about  5  percentage 
points.126  Non-contributory  social  protection 
programs  such  as  Bolsa  Familia,  a  simplifica-
tion  of  tax  rules  for  small  business,  increased 
incentives  for  firms  to  formalize  their  work-
ers,  and  improved  enforcement  of  tax  and 
labor  regulations  contributed  to  this  success. 
Poland,  an  aging  society,  has  seen  its  employ-
ment ratio increase from 60 percent in 2006 to 
65 percent in 2009. This was due to changes in  
the  application  of  eligibility  rules  of  disabil-
ity  pensions,  and  pension  reforms  adjusting 
the  level  of  benefits  down  as  life  expectancy 
increases. In 2012, a new wave of pension re-
forms raised the retirement age to 67 for men 
and women from the current 65 for men and 
60 for women.127

Connected jobs agendas: Global 
partnerships for jobs

Policies for jobs in one country can have spill-
overs to other countries, both positive and nega-
tive. An important issue is whether international 
coordination mechanisms could influence gov-
ernment decisions to enhance the positive spill-
overs  and  mitigate  the  negative.  Several   areas 
lend themselves to more and better coordination.
Rights  and  standards.  Cross-border  mecha-
nisms exist to set standards and provide chan-
nels for improving compliance with rights. ILO 
conventions  can  influence  domestic  legislation 
and be a channel for voice and coordination in-
ternationally, as demonstrated by the process of 
adopting  the  conventions  for  home-based  and 
domestic  workers.  The  support  for  core  labor 
standards  in  the  1998  Declaration  on  Funda-
mental  Principles  and  Rights  at Work  suggests 
that countries respond to pressure from the in-
ternational community.128 Yet the pressure only 
goes so far. The persistence of forced labor, chil-
dren working in hazardous conditions, discrimi-

Trade agreements are a potential instrument 
for  international  coordination  on  rights.  They 
can incorporate incentives for attention to voice 
and working conditions by linking trade access 
to the adoption and enforcement of labor laws 
and standards. Whether linking rights to trade 
actually leads to better outcomes for workers on 
either side of a trade agreement is less clear. La-
bor clauses can be used as a protectionist tool, 
undermining trade and employment opportu-
nities in developing countries. Moreover, in the 
absence  of  capacity  and  institutions  to  moni-
tor  and  enforce  compliance,  trade  agreements 
on  their  own  can  be  weak  instruments.  For 
instance,  Cambodia’s  successful  bilateral  trade 
agreement with the United States was accompa-

nied by two projects, one to build capacity for 
monitoring working conditions in garment fac-
tories and one to support an arbitration council 
to resolve collective labor disputes.129

Beyond  the 

initiatives  of  governments 
through  conventions  and  trade  agreements,  a 
growing  emphasis  is  being  placed  on  private 
sector accountability and the broader corporate 
social  responsibility  (CSR)  agenda,  whereby 
companies  voluntarily  bring  social  and  envi-
ronmental  concerns  into  their  operations.130 
Codes of conduct are most likely to be adopted 
by companies based in the European Union and 
North America,  which  then  make  engagement 
with  labor  standards  a  condition  of  business 
with suppliers. But there is limited evidence on 
the extent to which codes of conduct translate 
into  improved  enforcement  of  standards.  Be-

cause of the complexity of global supply chains, 
seasonal and temporary workers are outside the 
reach  of  CSR  frameworks.  Workers  outside  of 
global supply chains are not covered.131 To be ef-
fective, CSR efforts should focus more on build-
ing the capacity of local firms to comply and the 
capacity of labor inspectorates to do their work.
Trade  and  investment.  International  trade 
in  goods  has  been  gradually  liberalized  over 
time, and the notion that freer trade is mutu-
ally  beneficial  for  the  transacting  parties  is 
now widely shared. However, many developing 
countries still lack the competitiveness to har-
ness the benefits from global integration. Direct 
assistance to reduce logistic costs and improve 
the competitiveness of firms and farms is thus 
a priority. Aid for trade has increased substan-
tially  and  now  accounts  for  about  a  third  of 
total  aid  to  developing  countries.  But  there  is 
scope for making the assistance more effective, 
by focusing on the export activities most suited 
to address the specific jobs challenges that re-
cipient  countries  face.  Increasing  the  involve-
ment by the private sector would also enhance 
the effectiveness of the assistance.132 

In  contrast  to  trade  in  goods,  progress  in 
services  liberalization  has  been  slow,  at  both 
the  multilateral  and  the  regional  levels.  Offers 
to the Doha Round currently being negotiated 
promise  greater  security  in  access  to  markets 
but  no  additional  liberalization  compared  to 
the  policies  in  force.133  Services  are  character-
ized  by  well-known  market  imperfections—
from  network  externalities  in  infrastructure  to 
asymmetric  information  and  moral  hazard  in 
finance—and  are  thus  subject  to  more  perva-
sive  regulations.  Liberalizing  trade  in  services 
requires  adequate  domestic  regulation.  Setting 
up markets for electricity, or cushioning the so-
cial impacts of large distributors on retail trade, 
is challenging.134 Not surprisingly, liberalization 
of services is much less advanced in developing 
countries than in industrial countries.135 

The  productivity  gains  from  liberalizing 
services  would  be  substantial.  Many  services 
are  inputs  into  the  production  process.  Elec-
tricity,  finance,  telecommunications,  and  trade 
have a direct impact on business costs, affecting  
the competitiveness of downstream sectors. By 
boosting  job  creation  and  raising  labor  earn-
ings,  these  productivity  gains  should  also  lead 
to  improved  living  standards.  Social  impacts 

can  be  more  mixed.  They  are  clearly  positive 
when cell phones connect people (and especially 
the  poor)  to  product  markets,  to  employment 
 opportunities, or to government services. They 
can be negative when the disappearance of retail 
trade leads to the decline of urban centers and 
affects the livelihoods of older shopkeepers who 
may not find alternative employment easily. An 
adequate  sequencing  of  services  liberalization 
and  domestic  regulatory  reform  is  needed  to 
manage  these  tradeoffs,  and,  in  doing  so,  ad-
dress  the  concerns  of  developing  countries.136 
International  collaboration  can  fill  the  knowl-
edge gaps and facilitate implementation.137

International  agreements  can  also  promote 
global  public  goods.  One  case  in  point  is  gen-
der equality. Trade is not gender neutral, imply-
ing  that  liberalization  changes  women’s  access 
to  jobs.  Traditionally  men  were  more  likely  to 
have  “brawn  jobs,”  involving  stronger  physi-
cal  requirements,  while “brain  jobs”  involving 
dexterity,  attention,  or  communication—from 
stitching garments to processing data—present 
more opportunities for women. Call centers in 
Delhi and Mumbai employ more than 1 million 
people,  most  of  them  women.  Preferential  ac-
cess for imports from sectors with more “brain 
jobs” can thus create employment opportunities 
for women in countries where gender equality 
is  far  from  attained.138  But  as  countries  move 
up  the  ladder  of  global  value  chains,  gender 
opportunities can change. This was the case in 
Malaysia, where the share of women working in 
manufacturing declined in the mid-1980s.139 

Migration.  In  contrast  to  the  movement  of 
goods and services across borders, few interna-
tional agreements pertain to migration in gen-
eral and the migration of workers in particular. 
Those  in  existence  have  limited  coverage.  ILO 
conventions 97 and 143, in force since 1952 and 
1978, refer to the prevention of discrimination 
or abusive conditions against migrants and call 
for  penalties  and  sanctions  against  those  who 
promote  clandestine  or  illegal  migration.  But 
they have been ratified by only 49 and 23 coun-
tries, respectively. Liberalizing the provision of 
services by natural persons, in line with Mode 4 
of the General Agreement on Trade in Services 
(GATS), is not on the agenda of many countries, 
industrial  or  developing.  And  the  United  Na-
tions international convention on the rights of 
migrant  workers  and  their  families,  which  en-

34 

  WO R L D   D E V E LO P M E N T   R E P O RT   2 0 1 3

tered into force in 2003, has been ratified by only 
22 countries—mostly sending countries. 

While migration occurs across borders, leg-
islation  is  mostly  driven  by  country-specific 
laws.  This  is  an  area  where  a  global  perspec-
tive  is  warranted,  but  views  on  what  needs  to 
be  done  are  diverse.  One  view  focuses  on  the 
large  earnings  differentials  between  countries, 
suggesting  that  global  productivity  and  pov-
erty  reduction  would  accelerate  enormously 
with  the  free  movement  of  labor.140  Another 
perspective  focuses  instead  on  national  secu-
rity  and  the  protection  of  communities  and 
their  cultures,  implying  the  need  for  barriers 
to  contain  migration.  Yet  another  highlights 
the moral  imperative of protecting the human 
rights of migrants, no matter their legal status, 
and giving shelter to those who suffer any form 
of persecution.141 None of these views suffices, 
however, because any one of them alone cannot 
address  the  complex  tradeoffs  that  migration 
poses for policy design.

In  many  instances,  both  sending  and  re-
ceiving  countries  can  benefit  from  migration 
through a collaborative approach. Most abuses 
perpetrated  by  traffickers,  firms,  or  workers 
are associated with illegal migrant flows, so the 
formalization  of  these  flows  is  a  basic  tool  for 
protecting  the  rights  of  migrant  workers.  This 
formalization  cannot  be  enforced  without  the 
cooperation of institutions in both sending and 
receiving countries. That is why bilateral agree-
ments are also needed, with provisions for quo-
tas  by  occupation,  industry,  region,  and  dura-
tion of stay.142 The agreements can distinguish 
between  temporary  movements  of  workers 
and steps to permanent migration, with condi-
tions and protocols to go from one to another. 
They  can  include  considerations  about  taxa-
tion,  social security, and even financing higher 
education—a  special  concern  in  the  case  of  
“talent” migration. These agreements can design 
incentives so that stakeholders in both sending 
and receiving countries have an interest in en-
forcing the provisions.143

Jobs are center stage, but where are 
the numbers?

A  significant  research  and  data  agenda  lies 
ahead.  Further  analysis  is  needed  on  the  rela-

tionship  between  jobs  and  movements  in  and 
out  of  poverty;  the  dynamics  of  micro-  and 
small enterprises in the informal sector; and the 
links  between  jobs  and  human  behaviors  and 
norms. Research on the magnitude of spillovers 
from  jobs  could  identify  good  jobs  for  devel-
opment  tailored  to  country  contexts.  Another 
important research area concerns the impact of 
jobs  on  the  acquisition  of  cognitive  and  non-
cognitive skills, and how this impact varies de-
pending on the characteristics of the job and the 
person  who  holds  it.  Similarly,  more  evidence 
on productivity spillovers from jobs across cit-
ies  with  different  characteristics  would  have  a 
high value for development policy. Estimates of 
the environmental impacts of different types of 
jobs are, today, scarce at best. In the area of la-
bor policies, more empirical work is needed on 
the boundaries of the plateau, depending on the 
characteristics of the country. More research is 
also needed on how international trade, invest-
ment  across  borders,  and  migration  affect  the 
composition  of  employment  across  countries. 
More solid knowledge on the sequencing of in-
ternational commitments and domestic policies 
related to services could address the reluctance 
of developing countries to make further prog-
ress  in  the  direction  of  liberalization  and  reap 
the gains from global integration.

Setting policy priorities for jobs needs to be 
based on reliable data. Given that a large share of 
the people at work in developing countries are 
not wage employees, and that even fewer have a 
formal sector job, the measurement of employ-
ment  is  challenging.  Determining  which  jobs 
have the greatest payoffs for poverty reduction 
requires  linking  information  on  a  household’s 
income  or  consumption  with  information  on 
the  employment  of  its  members.  Understand-
ing which economic units create more jobs, or 
whether  labor  reallocation  leads  to  substantial 
growth  rather  than  just  churning,  requires  in-
formation  on  the  inputs  and  outputs  of  very 
diverse  production  units.  Assessing  how  the 
composition  of  employment  affects  trust  and 
willingness to participate in society requires in-
formation on individual values and behaviors.

The paucity of empirical analyses on the em-
ployment  impact  of  the  global  crisis  in  devel-
oping  countries  and  the  difficulty  of  compar-
ing  measures  of  informal  employment  across 
countries  suggest  that  data  quality  and  avail-

 

Moving jobs center stage   

35

ability  remain  a  constraint  for  policy  making. 
Much   effort  goes  into  measuring  unemploy-
ment  rates,  and  measuring  them  often.144  But 
open  unemployment  is  not  a  very  telling  in-
dicator  in  countries  where  a  large  fraction  of 
the labor force is not salaried. The Millennium 
Development Goal on eradicating poverty lists 
four indicators to monitor progress toward the 
employment  target,  defined  as “achieving  full 
and  productive  employment  and  decent  work 
for  all,  including  women  and  young  people.” 
But these indicators only partially capture ad-
vances in the quantity and quality of jobs in the 
developing world.145

Today’s challenges for labor statistics can be 
regrouped into three key areas: data gaps; data 
quality issues; and planning, coordination, and 
communication issues. Data gaps concern coun-
tries where labor statistics do not exist at all or 
are  collected  only  sporadically. Whenever  such 
statistics exist, data quality is a concern through-
out  the  statistical  production  chain,  from  the 
use of appropriate definitions to questionnaire 
design,  from  sampling  frame  to  interviewer  
processes,  and  from  data  entry  and  coding  to 
verification  and  estimation  procedures.  Plan-
ning,  coordination,  and  communication  issues 
arise when different institutions are responsible 
for collecting and disseminating the data.146

A  quarter  of  a  century  ago,  a  renewed  em-
phasis  on  poverty  reduction  as  the  key  objec-
tive  of  development  policy  launched  a  long-
term data effort. Across the world, information 
on  household  living  standards  was  collected 
through  standardized  surveys.  The  sampling 
methods and the variable definitions used were 
duly documented. And the data and documen-
tation  were  made  available  to  researchers  and 
practitioners  whenever  possible.  For  jobs,  em-
ployment  modules  attached  to  household  sur-
veys used for poverty analyses would need to be 

standardized  and  include  informal  firms  and 
microenterprises in establishment surveys. Such 
an approach would move jobs center stage.

Countries have a choice in responding to the jobs 
challenges  of  demographics,  structural  shifts, 
technological progress, and periodic macroeco-
nomic crises. They can simply pursue growth, 
ensure that the labor market functions well, and 
hope  that  jobs  will  follow.  Or  they  can  recog-
nize that growth does not mechanically deliver 
the jobs that do most for development. Jobs for 
women, jobs in cities and in global value chains, 
and jobs providing voice and protection for the 
most  vulnerable  in  society  may  come  high  on 
the list. The precise nature of the jobs challenge 
depends on a country’s geography, endowments, 
institutions, and level of development. What is 
common to all is the need to remedy the insti-
tutional failures and market imperfections that 
prevent  the  private  sector  from  creating  more 
of  those  good  jobs  for  development.  Coun-
tries can then return to the difficult questions 
posed at the outset. For each of them, there is  
a  conventional  wisdom  that  practitioners  do 
not consider to be totally satisfactory. The jobs 
lens in development does not lead to a flat rejec-
tion of the conventional wisdom, but to a quali-
fication of when it holds and when it does not.

In short, countries can leave themselves open 
to small gains in living standards, slow produc-
tivity growth, and fractious societies. Or, by ad-
dressing  their  jobs  challenges,  they  can  enjoy 
a  self-reinforcing  pattern  of  more  prosperous 
livelihoods,  rising  productivity,  and  the  stron-
ger social cohesion that comes from improving 
 employment  opportunities  and  fairness  in  ac-
cess to jobs.

QUeSTioNS  When is the conventional wisdom right?

Growth strategies or jobs strategies? The conventional wisdom 
is  to  focus  on  growth  as  a  precondition  for  continued 
increases in living standards and strengthened social cohe-
sion. But lags and gaps among the three transformations of 
living  standards,  productivity,  and  social  cohesion  are  not 
uncommon. The impact of growth on poverty reduction var-
ies con siderably across countries. And in some cases, growth 
is  not  accompanied  by  increased  social  cohesion—even 
though  poverty  may  fall  and  living  standards  improve  for 
some,  the  expectations  of  others  remain  unfulfilled.  The 
employment  intensity  of  different  sectors  and  fairness  in 
access to employment opportunities matter as well. It is thus 
jobs that bring together the three transformations.

Tradeoffs among improving living standards, accelerating 
productivity growth, and fostering social cohesion arguably 
reflect a measurement problem, more than a real choice. If 
growth  indicators  captured  the  intangible  social  benefits 
from jobs, from lower poverty to greater social cohesion, a 
growth strategy and a jobs strategy would be equivalent. But 
a  growth  strategy  may  not  pay  enough  attention  to  female 
employment,  or  to  employment  in  secondary  cities,  or  to 
idleness  among  youth.  When  potentially  important  spill-
overs from jobs are not realized, a jobs strategy may provide 
more useful insights.

Can entrepreneurship be fostered? The conventional wisdom 
is  that  most  micro-  and  small  enterprises  in  developing 
countries are just forms of survivorship, with limited chances 
to grow. But self-employed workers account for a large share 
of employment in developing countries. Even if only a frac-
tion  of  them  succeeded  in  building  a  viable  business,  the 
aggregate impact on living standards and productivity would 
be substantial. Moreover, in developing countries many large 
enterprises  are  born  large,  often  the  result  of  government 
support  or  privileged  access  to  finance  and  information. 
Breaking  privilege  is  one  more  reason  why  the  success  of 
micro- and small enterprises is so important.

Management practices are important in explaining firm 
productivity,  even  in  small  and  medium-size  firms.  The 
capacity to acquire skills and to apply them to business is one 
of the most important characteristics of successful entrepre-
neurs. Yet markets fail to nurture entrepreneurship, because 
knowledge  spillovers  imply  that  some  of  the  returns  to 
acquiring  or  developing  new  managerial  ideas  and  knowl-
edge are appropriated by others. And the potential to absorb 
management  practices  differs  greatly  among  beneficiaries. 
Observable characteristics of small business owners can pre-
dict  entrepreneurial  potential,  and  programs  to  upgrade 
their managerial capacity have been shown to make a differ-
ence. Programs targeted to small business owners with entre-

preneurial potential can thus make a substantial difference 
in living standards and productivity.

Can  policies  contribute  to  social  cohesion?  The  conventional 
wisdom is that a lack of jobs is detrimental to social cohesion, 
but other than ensuring full employment there is little that 
governments  can  or  should  do.  Yet  open  unemployment  is 
not the main challenge in many countries, as the characteris-
tics of jobs also matter. While not all jobs can positively affect 
social  cohesion,  those  that  shape  social  identity,  build  net-
works—particularly for excluded groups—and increase fair-
ness can help defuse tensions and support peaceful collective 
decision making. 

Measures  that  support  inclusion,  extend  access  to  voice 
and rights, and improve transparency and accountability in 
the labor market can increase the extent to which people per-
ceive that they have a stake in society. This perception can be 
especially  critical  when  risks  of  social  unrest  from  youth 
unemployment and conflict are high. Employment programs 
can undermine social cohesion if they have weak governance 
or divisive targeting, but can have positive effects when they 
are well-designed. Jobs policies for youth at risk can incorpo-
rate  counseling  and  training  in  conflict  resolution.  Public 
works programs can facilitate community participation and 
engagement  between  citizens  and  local  authorities.  Policies 
can thus focus not only on the number of jobs, but on expand-
ing job opportunities for excluded groups.

Skills or jobs—what comes first? The conventional wisdom is 
that investing in skills will lead to job creation and to higher 
productivity  and  labor  income.  High  unemployment  and 
skills  mismatches  are  often  attributed  to  shortcomings  in 
education and training systems. But in reality they can also 
result from market distortions, which send the wrong signals 
to the education system or lead to a lack of dynamism in pri-
vate firms. In such situations, massive investments in train-
ing systems, as seen in many parts of the world, might show 
disappointing  results  as  hoped-for  job  outcomes  do  not 
materialize.

A  core  set  of  basic  skills,  both  cognitive  and  social,  is 
necessary for productive employment, and they cannot just 
be  acquired  on  the  job.  Without  such  generic  skills,  the 
prospects  of  improving  employment  opportunities  and 
earnings  are  thin.  Skills  are  also  critical  for  countries  to 
move up the value-added ladder, as they can ignite innova-
tion,  produce  the  benefits  of  mutual  learning,  and  hence 
lead  to  job  creation  themselves.  But  in  between,  much 
learning can happen through work: job opportunities can 
shape  social  skills  and  create  demand  for  education  and 
training. Learning on the job leads to significantly higher 

 

Moving jobs center stage   

37

earnings  in  many  settings,  with  the  return  to  one  year  of 
work experience being around a third to half of the return 
to an additional year of schooling. 

A targeted investment climate? The conventional wisdom is 
that a level playing field is preferable because governments 
do not have enough information to pick winners and tar-
geting  can  be   captured  by  interest  groups.  But  given  the 
often  limited  fiscal  space  and  administrative  capacity  of 
developing  countries,  creating  an  enabling  business  envi-
ronment across the board can be challenging, and the rele-
vant  question  is  how  policy  priorities  should  be  set.  The 
conventional  wisdom  views  targeting  with  a  skepticism  
that  stems  from  failed  experiences  with  industrial  policy. 
However, targeting may not necessarily be aimed at indus-
trial  sectors.  Supporting  job  creation  in  sectors  with  high 
rates of female employment, or productivity gains in small-
holder  farming,  or  more  jobs  connected  to  global  value 
chains  may  have  high  development  payoffs  depending  on 
country contexts.

When there is clarity about where the good jobs for devel-
opment  are,  and  there  is  sufficient  information  to  under-
stand what can be done to support the creation of those jobs, 
a targeted investment climate may be warranted. But this is 
provided that targeted interventions can be designed in a way 
that makes them resilient to  capture by interest groups. The 
risk  of  capture  is  easier  to  contain  when  the  number  of 
 beneficiaries is very large, such as the case of farmers, urban 
businesses,  and  female  micro-entrepreneurs.  It  is  much 
higher in the case of industrial policy.

Competing for jobs? The conventional wisdom is that the num-
ber of jobs is not finite, so that policies for jobs in one country 
cannot be harmful to other countries. Indeed, in the medium 
to long term, total employment is roughly determined by the 
size  of  the  labor  force.  But  policies  may  alter  global  trade, 
investment, and migration flows, affecting the composition of 
employment. The concern is that the share of good jobs for 
development  may  decline  in  one  country  as  it  increases  in 
another. Policies aimed at capturing a larger global share of 
the jobs with the largest productive spillovers can reduce well-
being abroad, even if global well-being increases.

However, not all efforts to support job creation amount to 
beggar-thy-neighbor policies. Whether they do so depends on 
the type of instruments used and the nature of the spillovers 
from jobs. A key question is what purpose policies serve. Poli-
cies that aim to improve compliance with rights, prosecuting 
forced  labor  and  harmful  forms  of  child  labor,  amount  to 
providing a global public good. On the other hand, policies 
that aim at reaping the benefits from productive externalities 
may  adversely  affect  other  countries,  especially  when  they 
undermine an open trading system and are not aligned with a 
country’s dynamic comparative advantage.

Protecting  workers  or  protecting  jobs?  The  conventional  wis-
dom is that policies that protect people are preferable, because 
they mitigate welfare losses while at the same time allowing 
the reallocation of labor, hence supporting creative destruc-
tion. Protecting jobs that are no longer economically viable 
through  government  transfers  and  employment  protection 
legislation freezes an inefficient allocation of resources. Pro-
tecting jobs also entails a high risk of capture. It may lead to 
enduringly  unproductive  jobs,  stifle  technological  advance, 
prevent structural change, and eventually undermine growth.
However,  there  are  times  when  many  jobs  are  lost  or 
threatened at once and few are being created. There are also 
jobs  generating  substantial  productivity  spillovers,  whose 
disappearance in large numbers can lead to ghost towns and 
depressed regions. Protecting people should have primacy if 
shocks  are  idiosyncratic—if  the  employment  dislocation  is 
local and limited and if turnover continues to be the norm. 
Protecting jobs may be warranted in times of systemic crises 
or major economic restructuring. But job protection policies 
can  create  permanent  inefficiency,  especially  in  countries 
with weak institutions, making it indispensable to establish 
and enforce trigger rules and sunset clauses that define the 
extent and size of the protection.

How  to  accelerate  the  reallocation  of  workers?  The  conven-
tional  wisdom  is  to  focus  policy  on  removing  the  labor  
market  rigidities  that  keep  workers  in  firms  or  areas  with  
low productivity. But reforms may not always be politically 
feasible.  In  India,  complex  and  cumbersome  labor  market 
institutions  have  unambiguously  negative  effects  on  eco-
nomic efficiency but these institutions have remained largely 
untouched for 60 years.

Tolerance for the avoidance or evasion of distortive regu-
lation can help contain their cost but not ensure dynamism. 
In India, widespread noncompliance has been the dominant 
response to cumbersome labor regulations. However, labor-
intensive  manufacturing  sectors  remain  sluggish  despite 
buoyant performance of the overall economy. Other coun-
tries  with  similarly  stringent  regulatory  obstacles  have 
accomplished  more  efficiency-enhancing  labor  reallocation 
by actively taking advantage of productivity spillovers from 
jobs  in  industrial  clusters,  dynamic  cities,  or  global  value 
chains  to  make  the  regulations  less  binding.  In  Sri  Lanka,  
the  development  of  export  processing  zones  (EPZs)  drove  
the  takeoff  of  the  garment  industry.  In  Brazil,  the  surge  of 
internal  migration  is  closely  associated  with  the  country’s 
continuing integration into the global economy and a devel-
opment  policy  that  favors  clusters  and  agglomeration.  In 
China,  labor  reallocation  is  rooted  in  the  development  of 
competitive  cities,  supported  by  regional  competition  and 
experimentation. A strategic focus on enhancing productiv-
ity  spillovers  from  jobs,  through  urbanization  and  global 
integration, can overcome the labor rigidity.

22.  Private  sector  employment  refers  here  to “pri-
vate firms” and to “individuals” according to the 
official  Chinese  classsification.  The  former  are 
defined as for-profit units invested in and estab-
lished by natural persons or controlled by per-
sons using more than seven workers. The latter 
includes units that hire fewer than eight workers. 
Foreign-invested  firms  and  collectives  are  not 
part of the private sector in official statistics. For 
more details, see Kanamori and Zhao (2004).

The jobs challenge

Demographic transitions, structural change, technological progress, and 
global volatility are changing the world of work. Yet, traditional farming 
and self-employment remain dominant in many countries.

Worldwide, more than 3 billion people 

have jobs, but the nature of their jobs 
varies greatly. Some 1.65 billion have 
regular  wages  or  salaries.  Another  1.5  billion 
work in farming and small household enterprises, 
or in casual or seasonal day labor. The majority 
of workers in the poorest countries are engaged 
in these types of work, outside the scope of an 
employer-employee  relationship.  Another  200 
million people, a disproportionate share of them 
youth, are unemployed and actively looking for 
work.  Almost  2  billion  working-age  adults  are 
neither  working  nor  look ing  for  work;  the 
majority of these are women, and an unknown 
number are eager to have a job.1 

The jobs challenge facing the world is multi-
faceted, ranging from improving aspects of the 
work people do, to supporting the reallocation 
of  people  to  better  jobs,  to  creating  jobs  for 
those who want to work. Youth bulges in some 
countries  are  bringing  in  millions  of  new  job 
seekers. Sub-Saharan Africa’s labor force grows 
by  about  8  million  people  every  year.  South 
Asia’s grows by 1 million people every month. 
Elsewhere, the working population is rapidly ag-
ing, and more and more workers are putting off 
retirement. By 2020, more than 40 million ad-
ditional jobs will be needed for people 65 years 
and older.2

Structural  and  technological  changes  are 
moving more people from rural areas to cities. 

In  the  next  15  years,  half  of  the  population  in 
developing countries will reside in urban areas, 
the result of a migration that is rapidly shifting 
work from the farm to the factory or the street. 
The rural-urban shift generally improves indi-
vidual well-being, especially for those who find 
wage employment. Still, workers’ share of global 
income may be declining, a pattern attributed in 
part to globalization and technological change. 
Wages for the same occupation are converging 
across countries, but a higher premium is paid 
for more skilled occupations. Women’s earnings 
still lag behind those of men, and the fraction of 
them who work varies enormously across coun-
tries.  While  women’s  labor  force  participation 
exceeds 75 percent in Vietnam, it is only 28 per-
cent in Pakistan.

As the world changes, so do jobs. Despite im-
provements in workers’ education levels, many 
firms report that they have difficulty finding the 
skilled workers they seek. Part-time and tempo-
rary work appear to be increasing. In India and 
South  Africa,  for  example,  there  has  been  a 
sharp rise in the number of temporary employ-
ment  services  and  labor  brokers.  Outsourcing 
was  once  concentrated  in  manufacturing,  but 
new technology is now enabling the splintering 
of tasks in services. Meanwhile, new platforms 
on the internet and mobile phones offer innova-
tions for matching workers and employers, and 
not only for highly skilled jobs.

 

The jobs challenge

A job, but not always a salary

To many, the word job brings to mind a worker 
with  an  employer  and  a  regular  paycheck.  Yet, 
this narrow definition excludes nearly 1.5 billion 
people who work for a living. The concept of a 
job is actually much broader than wage employ-
ment. Jobs are activities that generate actual or 
imputed income, monetary or in kind, formal or 
informal.  But  not  all  forms  of  work  can  be 
deemed  jobs.  Activities  performed  against  the 
will of the worker or involving violations of fun-
damental  human  rights  should  not  be  consid-
ered jobs. Some other activities that entail work 
effort, such as cooking and cleaning at home, are 
not considered jobs unless they are performed by 
people hired and paid for the work.

Multiple forms of work

Defining and measuring jobs is challenging be-
cause the ways people spend their time and work 
are diverse (question 1). Economists usually dis-
tinguish between work and leisure, but the real-
ity  is  more  complex.  Time  can  be  allocated  to 
nonproduction  and  production  activities.  The 
first category includes time spent eating, sleep-
ing, schooling, and at recreation. Production in-
cludes  both  market  and  nonmarket  work. 
Whether  an  activity  is  considered  production 
can be assessed based on a third-person test: “if 
an activity is of such character that it might be 
delegated  to  a  paid  worker,  then  that  activity 
shall be deemed productive.”3

Patterns in time allocated to production dif-
fer  across  countries  and  over  time.  Jobs  that 
span  eight  hours  a  day,  five  days  a  week,  with 
paid vacation, are not the norm in developing 
countries.  Some  jobs  involve  a  few  hours  of 
work during certain days of the week or certain 
weeks of the year; others entail long hours most 
days of the week almost every week of the year. 
Some people have had only one job in the pre-
vious  week,  while  others  have  engaged  in  two  
or more jobs. In 2011, temporary employment 
represented  more  than  one-fifth  of  total  wage 
employment in the Republic of Korea and Spain, 
but around 5 percent in Australia and the Slovak 
Republic.4

The measurement of unemployment or un-
deremployment  is  equally  challenging.  Some 

people would like to work more hours, whereas 
others would rather not. More than 15 percent 
of those employed in Armenia, Colombia, Gua-
temala,  and  Peru,  but  less  than  3  percent  in 
Hungary,  Pakistan,  Portugal,  and  the  United 
States worked fewer hours than desired.5 Some 
people  who  would  like  to  work  have  no  job.  
Unemployment rates vary over the business cy-
cle; around 2009 and 2010, when the worst of 
the  international  crisis  hit  most  countries  in  
the world, they ranged from more than 20 per-
cent in South Africa and Spain to less than 5 per-
cent in Austria, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Sri 
Lanka, and Thailand.6

The world of work is more diverse in devel-
oping  countries  than  in  developed  countries. 
This diversity refers not only to the number of 
hours  worked  and  number  of  jobs  available, 
usual  yardsticks  in  developed  countries,  but 
also to characteristics of jobs. Two main aspects 
stand  out.  First,  there  is  prevalence  of  self- 
employment,  which  often  makes  measures  of 
unemployment  and  underemployment  inade-
quate.7  Second,  the  coexistence  of  traditional 
and  modern  modes  of  production  leads  to  
large  variations  in  the  nature  of  work,  from 
subsistence  agriculture  and  menial  work  to 
technology-driven manufacturing and services. 
Work across the developing world is charac-
terized  by  a  high  prevalence  of  informality, 
whether defined on the basis of firm registra-
tion, social security coverage, or a written em-
ployment  contract.  Informal  employment  is 
not under the purview of labor regulations, ei-
ther because of their limited scope or because 
they  are  deliberately  avoided  or  evaded.  Re-
gardless  of  the  specific  definition  used,  infor-
mal  employment  is  generally  associated  with 
lower productivity. However, this does not nec-
essarily mean that firm registration, social secu-
rity coverage, or a written contract would result 
in greater efficiency. Informality can be a symp-
tom of lower productivity as much as it can be 
a cause of it.

Different places, different jobs

Self-employment and farming represent almost 
half the jobs in the developing world. The vast 
majority  of  those  in  self-employment  work  
in  small  enterprises  with  no  paid  employees.8

But  shares  of  wage  work,  farming,  and  self- 
employment differ greatly by gender and across 
countries.  Nonwage  work  represents  more 
than  80  percent  of  women’s  employment  in  
Sub-Saharan Africa, but less than 20 percent in  
countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia 
(figure 1.1). 

Gender differences are also striking.9 World-
wide, less than 50 percent of women have jobs, 
whereas almost 80 percent of men do. Roughly 
50  percent  of  both  working  men  and  working 
women are wage earners, but this statistic hides 
substantial  variation  across  countries  and  re-
gions.  Women  are  significantly  underrepre-
sented in wage employment in low- and lower-
middle-income  countries,  but  are  more  likely 
than men to work for wages in middle-income 
countries. In countries such as Pakistan, where 
28 percent of women but more than 82 percent 
of men participate in the labor force, wage em-
ployment is a much lower share of total employ-
ment among women than among men. Even in 
countries such as Tanzania and Vietnam, where 
participation rates are above 75 percent for both 
men  and  women,  wage  employment  still  lags 
behind  for  women.  Beyond  these  stark  con-
trasts, women continue to earn significantly less 
than  men.  And  these  differences  are  not  fully 

explained by education, experience, or sector of 
work.

A growing share of youth, typically defined 
as  people  ages  15  to  24,  is  in  schooling  or  in  
training.  Still,  youth  unemployment  reaches 
alarming levels in some countries (above 40 per-
cent in South Africa since early 2008 and above 
50  percent  in  Spain  in  early  2012).10  Even  in 
countries where it is relatively low, the youth un-
employment rate is twice or more the national 
average. In addition, a large share of young peo-
ple are considered “idle”—not in education, not 
employed,  and  not  in  training  or  looking  for 
work  (figure  1.2).11  In  some  countries,  more 
than one-third of 15- to 24-year-olds are idle; in 
most countries, unemployment rates are small 
compared  to  idleness  rates.12  In  many  cases, 
when youth work they do so in unpaid jobs. If 
paid, they are less likely to have access to social 
security.13

Although child labor is in decline, it still af-
fects 1 in 8 children (1 in 14 in the case of haz-
ardous work). The International Labour Orga-
nization (ILO) defines child labor as any work 
by  a  child  under  age  12  or,  for  a  child  above  
age 12, any work that impedes education or is 
damaging to health and personal development. 
Worldwide, 306 million children were at work in 

 

The jobs challenge   

51

2008. Of these, 215 million were engaged in ac-
tivities that constituted child labor, and 115 mil-
lion were involved in hazardous work.14 Most of 
these children are unpaid family workers or par-
ticipate in farming. More than half live in Asia 
and the Pacific; but the share is highest is in Sub-
Saharan Africa, where child labor affects 1 in 4 
children (or 65 million of them). 

Youth bulges, aging societies,  
and migrant nations

Demographic shifts can be massive, but they do 
not always go in the same direction. The most 
populous  countries  in  the  world  have  experi-
enced  very  large  increases  in  their  labor  force: 
nearly  8  million  new  entrants  a  year  in  China 
and  7  million  a  year  in  India  since  the  early 
1990s. (These rates are now decelerating rapidly, 
particularly in China.) Many smaller countries 
face large relative increases, even if the absolute 
numbers are less astounding. In other countries, 
the  overall  population  and  the  labor  force  are 
shrinking. For example, Ukraine’s labor force is 
estimated to decrease by 0.75 percent annually, 
the  equivalent  of  approximately  160,000  fewer 
people every year.15 

A  simple  conceptual  exercise  illustrates  the 
challenges raised by these dramatic demographic 
transitions. To keep the ratio of employment to 
working-age population constant, in 2020, there 
should be around 600 million more jobs than in 
2005. More than 175 million of them, or nearly  
1 million a month, would be needed in East Asia 
and the Pacific as well as in South Asia (figure 
1.3). The number of jobs in Sub-Saharan Africa 
would  have  to  increase  by  about  50  percent, 
which translates into employment growth of 2.7 
percent a year. But in Eastern Europe and Cen-
tral Asia, where populations are aging, only 2.4 
million  new  jobs  would  be  needed  during  the 
same period.

The age structure of the labor force, not sim-
ply its size, matters as well. Youth are staying in 
school  longer  and  entering  the  labor  market 
later,  whereas  adults  are  living  longer  and 
healthier lives. The labor force participation rate 
of people 65 years of age and older has remained 
relatively stable over the past two decades. Even 
with a stable participation rate, however, close to

42 million jobs will have to be generated by 2020 
to cope with the growth in the number of older 
people. One-quarter of these jobs will need to be 
in  China,  even  though  the  size  of  the  Chinese 
labor force will have started to decline in abso-
lute terms.16

International migration is also changing the 
size and composition of the labor force in many 
countries. At the turn of the century, there were 
more  than  200  million  international  migrants 
worldwide, and nearly 90 million of them were 
workers. If international migrants constituted a 
nation, theirs would be the fifth-largest in the 
world, ahead of Brazil. Precise estimates diverge 
but there is agreement that migrants represent 
nearly 3 percent of the world population.17

These aggregate figures hide important dif-
ferences across countries. Some are large migra-
tion recipients either in absolute numbers (for 
instance, the United States) or in relative terms

(Jordan  and  Singapore).  Migrants  from  coun-
tries such as Bangladesh, India, and Mexico rep-
resent a large share of total migrants worldwide; 
countries such as Fiji, Jamaica, and Tonga have a 
large share of their population overseas. Figures 
for  some  of  the  smaller  countries  are  striking. 
For instance, nearly one-fifth of all Salvadorians 
live abroad, while more than three-fifths of the 
population  in  Kuwait,  Qatar,  and  the  United 
Arab Emirates is foreign-born.18

Cities, wages, and women

significant 
Economic  development  brings 
changes in the composition of the labor force, a 
process  known  as  structural  transformation.19 
Before 2020, more than half of the total popula-
tion in developing countries is expected to be 
living in cities and towns.20 That means that the 
growth  of  the  nonagricultural  labor  force  will 
vastly exceed the growth of the agricultural la-
bor force.21 Urbanization derives from growth 
in agricultural productivity that sustains higher 
standards  of  living.  It  can  also  be  associated 
with  rapid  economic  growth  at  the  aggregate 
level, because urban jobs tend to be more pro-
ductive than rural jobs. But that has not always 

been  the  case.22  Population  movements  away 
from  agriculture  were  indeed  associated  with 
rapid economic growth in East Asia; much less 
so in Sub-Saharan Africa (figure 1.4). 

Technological change induces families to in-
crease market production in place of home pro-
duction.23 Structural change has increased the 
time  devoted  to  consumption  or  investment 
activities but it has also meant more work. In 
some  cases,  structural  change  has  even  led  to 
 reduced leisure,24 particularly for workers who 
shift to market jobs with low productivity.25 In 
the past, this process of structural change often 
took  decades,  but  in  many  developing  coun-
tries, it is transforming lives within a generation 
(box 1.1).

The shift from home to market production is 
not gender neutral, because women have tended 
to specialize in home production whereas men 
traditionally have focused more on market pro-
duction. As women move into jobs, they often 
continue to work at home. When both jobs and 
home activities are considered, women are gen-
erally  busier  than  men.  This  is  so  in  rich  and 
poor countries. Evidence from Sub-Saharan Af-
rica, Europe, and India shows that women spend 
more  time  on  production  activities  than  men 
do.26  But  when  they  take  on  jobs—especially

BOX 1.1   The nature of work and leisure change as cities develop

The process of structural transformation can be seen today in small 
and medium-size cities throughout the developing world. The pro-
cess has been so fast that most people, even young ones, remem-
ber the old rural setting. As they have embraced the traits of mod-
ern urban life, their jobs and their leisure have changed so much 
that they do not contemplate returning to the old mores.

A neighborhood of 5,000 outside the city of Tangerang, Indone-
sia, started coming to life 25 years ago, when iron, rubber, garment, 
and thread factories sprang up in the surrounding areas. Some in 
the  neighborhood  still  work  as  farmhands.  But  most  women  and 
men earn their living in the factories, as well as in a variety of jobs 
that  rose  up  alongside  them.  Many  men  drive  ojeks  (motorcycle 
taxis); women sell sweets and other items by the gates of the facto-
ries.  Residents  also  make  a  living  through  home-based  garment 
piecework,  handicrafts  such  as  broom-making,  and  construction 
work; some are civil servants and teachers. Poorer women collect 
and resell scraps of fabric. The flow of newcomers has also offered 
an  income-generating  opportunity  to  local  families  from  renting 
rooms for lodging. Seemingly everyone in the neighborhood has a 
cell phone and gets around on their own motorcycle.

A 28-year-old steelworker and father of one said that getting 
factory  work  used  to  be  a  lot  easier  when  the  community  was 
newer. Junior high school graduates were still accepted for work 
then. Now, he said, production workers must have at least a senior 
high school degree, and vocational school graduates under age 30 

are preferred. Practices surrounding recruitment have also become 
tighter. “It is public knowledge,” he added, “that to be accepted in 
the company, candidates must have an inside connection because 
more and more people need work, while the number of job oppor-
tunities  is  limited.”  Many  factory  workers  in  the  neighborhood 
work on a six-month contract and hope for its renewal. The best 
local job available is often reported to be running one’s own busi-
ness. Even when faced with possible unemployment, a 41-year-old 
noted  he  had  “never  thought  of  returning  to  the  village.  That  is 
desperate.  Don’t  be  desperate.  Find  another  job  and  don’t  get 
picky.”

Comparing  the  situation  now  to  the  early  days,  a  local  official 
described  the  neighborhood’s  busy  market  as  “cleaner  and  more 
strategic now, and there are more sellers or merchants, so there are 
more options. Public transportation to the market is more accessible 
now. It used to be hard to find, and the streets used to be muddy.” 
He estimated that poverty in the neighborhood had fallen by half, 
from 20 percent at the turn of the century to around 10 percent now. 
He  indicated  that  the  neighborhood  had  weathered  the  global 
financial crisis well and that factory workers had been able to keep 
their  jobs.  These  changes  to  work  come  with  changes  in  leisure. 
Young men now spend time on computer chats and playing video 
games.  “We  used  to  send  letters  through  the  post  office,”  recalls  
a  22-year-old.  “Now,  nobody  wants  to  go  to  the  post  office.  .  .  .  
It’s beneath them. Now everyone has cell phones.”

BOX 1.2   Jobs bring earnings opportunities to women, but also new difficulties

Jobs  can  transform  women’s  roles  in  households  and  in  society 
more broadly. In a community of 3,000 inhabitants outside Durban, 
South Africa, 80 percent of the women were estimated to be work-
ing outside their home, mainly as teachers and nurses but also in 
offices and retail outlets or with the police. Women did not have 
such opportunities 10 years ago. “Women are no longer regarded 
as  housewives,”  a  young  woman  remarked  in  a  Durban  focus 
group.

In a bustling neighborhood in East Jakarta, in Indonesia, women 
work  as  street  sellers,  peddling  food,  glasses,  plates,  and  carpets. 
Young  women  explained  that  selling  carpets  is  hard  work  that 
women do “because they have to help support their families. Their 
husbands’ jobs don’t generate enough income.” With more educa-
tion than their elders, young women in this area of Jakarta are more 
likely to be working in the nearby ceramic factory or in one of the 
shops or beauty salons in the neighborhood’s markets or at the new 
shopping malls in the city.

In  a  poor  neighborhood  of  Santiago  de  los  Caballeros,  the  
second-largest city in the Dominican Republic, only a few women 
sold clothes and sweets in the streets a decade ago. Many are now 
earning incomes from activities such as selling lottery tickets or run-
ning small clothing stores and beauty salons. The incomes of these 
women  are  vitally  important  to  their  families  because  men  are 
struggling.  Factory  opportunities  and  other  jobs  associated  with 
the city’s free trade zone have been shrinking in recent years. Par-
ticipants  in  a  Santiago  focus  group  said  that  women  found  work 

more easily than men because employers have “more confidence in 
them [the women].” 

Increased  labor  force  participation  is  not  without  challenges. 
The women in Santiago worry about their safety because of assaults, 
theft, and gang violence; many think it is too dangerous to work at 
night. Despite the expansion of work opportunities, mobility con-
tinues to be a constraint not only because of poor transportation 
and safety risks but also because of the roles women play as income-
earners and as caregivers in the household. In rural areas, women 
face  difficulties  in  traveling  for  farm  work  and  other  jobs  outside 
their villages because of traditional cultural and gender norms.

In a semi-urban area outside Cuzco, in Peru, large numbers of 
women are now engaged in home-based handicrafts, sewing, and 
diverse agricultural activities. Outside the home, they take up farm 
jobs, run their own small shops or restaurants, or work for hire in 
these  places.  The  women  explained,  however,  that  they  consider 
home-based activities (such as raising livestock) to be better jobs 
than jobs outside the home, because “it’s peaceful work, and we can 
look after the kids.”

Women encounter many difficulties in commuting across cities 
for work. In Lautoka, an urban area in Fiji, the local economy is stag-
nant, and women are working in much larger numbers to help their 
households cope. Focus group participants explained that only men 
“can take up jobs in a different town . . . but not the wife because  
she has responsibilities at home to look after the kids and in-laws.”

those that are outside the household setting—

Jobs are changing in surprising ways

New  technologies,  globalization,  and  structural 
transformation have brought about remarkable 
improvements  in  efficiency.  Some  developing 
countries have managed to narrow the produc-
tivity gap with industrial countries in only a few 
decades.27 But others have failed to catch up and 
the gap remains considerable for all de veloping 
regions (figure 1.5). 

The  nature  of  work  is  changing  as  well.  
Industrial  countries  are  experiencing  a  sus-
tained shift away from primary and traditional 
manufacturing  industries  toward  services  and 
knowledge-intensive  jobs.  At  the  same  time, 
technology  improvements  and  greater  reliance 
on outsourcing to developing countries is lead-
ing to a decline in middle-skilled jobs.28 Technol-
ogy has allowed production tasks to be splintered 
and therefore performed in different locations.29 

Transnational  companies  have  built  integrated 
value chains and can tap into national skill pools 
around the world.30 Outsourcing is occurring in 
services as well as manufacturing. The share of 
developing countries in exports of world services 
rose  from  11  percent  in  1990  to  21  percent  in 
2008.31 India has led the way in the information 
technology (IT) sector, but other countries, such 
as the Arab Republic of Egypt, have begun to fo-
cus attention on exporting services.32

This  changing  landscape  of  global  produc-
tion has also brought about shifts in skills en-
dowments and in the distribution of top talent 
across countries. India and China rank high in 
perceived attractiveness as hubs of outsourcing 
because  of  their  exceptionally  high  ratings  in 
people skills and availability.33 India has close to 
20 million students in higher education, nearly 
as many as the United States; both countries are 
outpaced by China, with 30 million postsecond-
ary students.34 The United States still accounts 
for a large share of international top scorers in 
student  assessments,  but  Korea  has  the  same 
share as Germany, and both are closely followed

by the Russian Federation. The number of high-
performing  students  in  the  city  of  Shanghai 
alone is one-fifth of that of  Germany and about 
double that of Argentina.35

Skills are not one-dimensional, however. Dif-
ferent  jobs  require  different  combinations  of 
manual skills (needed for physical tasks), cogni-
tive skills (needed for mental tasks), and social 
skills (needed to interact with others). The dis-
tribution of employment by occupation can be 
used  to  estimate  the  skill  intensity  of  produc-
tion. As incomes rise, countries tend to use fewer 
manual skills in production, and more nonrou-
tine cognitive skills. 36 However, even for a given 
level of gross domestic product (GDP) per cap-
ita, countries can use nonroutine skills to vary-
ing degrees (figure 1.6).37

Technological progress expands the possibili-
ties  for  emerging  and  even  low-income  coun-
tries to create jobs in higher-skilled production 
activities as well as to link to international value 
chains in services and manufacturing. In other 
words, technological progress enables countries 
to diverge from a linear evolutionary path from 
manual skill intensity to the use of higher-order 
cognitive and social skills.38 India and China top 
the list of countries in an index measuring their 

 attractiveness as hubs for the outsourcing of ser-
vices. Ghana and Senegal, ranked 26th and 28th, 
come in significantly ahead of emerging market 
powerhouses  like  South  Africa  or  Turkey.39 
High-skilled  niches  are  developing  the  world 
over. They tend to be  located in close proximity 
to centers of higher education in metropolitan 
areas  with  good  infrastructure,  from  Cairo’s 
Smart Village Business Park to Ghana’s IT En-
abled  Service Industry cluster. 40 Bangalore and 
Chennai  in  India  and  Suzhou  in  China  have 
emerged  as  global  research  and  development 
hotspots.

Technology itself is changing the way work-
ers  and  firms  connect,  through  their  access  to 
much larger, even global, marketplaces for em-
ployment. Some of these marketplaces operate 
through the Internet; others use mobile phone 
technology.41 These changes are affecting work-
ers in developing countries and not just those in 
high-skilled occupations. Babajobs, for example, 
was  launched  in  2009  and  is  now  the  largest 
digital marketplace for blue-collar jobs in India, 
with  more  than  320,000  job  listings  and  more 
than 80,000 job seekers.

With changes in technology and the organi-
zation  of  work,  permanent  jobs  are  becoming

less  common.  Part-time  and  temporary  wage 
employment (also called nonstandard employ-
ment) is now a major feature of industrial coun-
tries.  More  than  half  the  firms  in  the  United 
States expect to raise the share of their part-time 
and  temporary  employees  over  the  next  five 
years.42 The trend is also evident in developing 
countries (box 1.3). 

People’s jobs may not match their aspirations. 
Surveys in high-income countries show that as 
many as half of all workers—among both self-
employed  and  wage  employees—would  prefer 
to be their own bosses.43 Percentages are lower  
in  low-  and  middle-income  countries,  where  
a  larger  fraction  of  the  labor  force  works  in 
household enterprises or on farms. On average,  
about one-fourth of adults from 35 countries in 
Eastern  Europe  and  Central  Asia  prefer  self- 
employment, but the rate varies from 10 percent 
in  Azerbaijan  and  Hungary  to  43  percent  in  
Belarus and Turkey.44 In poorer countries, self- 
employment  is  often  a  choice  of  last  resort,  in 
part because of the inability to find salaried em-
ployment.45 Owning a small business is a goal to 
which the poor do not always aspire.46

Prosperity, but a changing 
distribution of earnings 

Earnings from work increase with economic de-
velopment, and the benefits associated with jobs 
improve as well (figure 1.7). The relationship is 
not  mechanical,  but  growth  is  unambiguously 
good for jobs. Part of the change in earnings and 
benefits stems from the higher average skills that 
economies  gain  as  they  become  more  devel-
oped; part comes from workers with the same 
skills enjoying better opportunities. 

Poverty has declined in the developing world, 
to a large extent through jobs. The share of the 
population  of  the  developing  world  living  on 
less  than  US$1.25  a  day  (in  purchasing  power 
parity, or PPP) fell from 52 percent in 1981 to 22 
percent in 2008, or from 1.94 billion to 1.29 bil-
lion  people.47  This  reduction  is  the  result  of 
multiple factors, but the creation of millions of 
new, more productive jobs, mostly in Asia but 
also in other parts of the developing world, has 
been the main driving force.48 More people have 
jobs now than ever before, and those jobs pro-
vide generally higher earnings.

BOX 1.3   The temporary staffing industry is growing in developing countries

A decade ago, the temporary staffing industry was seen as irrele-
vant outside of high-income countries. But it is now growing rapidly 
in  some  developing  countries,  even  beyond  large  cities.a  This 
growth  is  often  viewed  as  a  response  to  the  complex  regulatory 
framework facing employers. Temporary staffing also allows more 
flexibility in the management of peak workloads and in adjusting 
staffing levels up or down in line with business demands. 

Depending  on  the  context,  the  temporary  staffing  industry 
employs  different  types  of  workers,  from  mainly  entry-level,  previ-
ously unemployed workers seeking to gain experience to highly edu-
cated, mid-level career employees looking to fast-track their careers.
In South Africa, temporary workers make up about 7 percent of 
the  labor  force;  the  temporary  staffing  industry  provides  employ-
ment to an average of 410,000 workers a day.b Finance—the sector in 
the statistics that includes temporary staffing—was a close second 
to  retail  in  employment  growth  from  1994  to  2009. Unskilled  jobs 
and  service-related  occupations  dominate  the  employment  distri-
bution within the labor brokering subsector. A worker employed in 
temporary  staffing  services  is  less  likely  to  contribute  to  pension 
funds or health insurance and is generally seen as more vulnerable.

Temporary  forms  of  employment  have  existed  in  India  for 
decades, partly as a way to circumvent rigid labor laws.c However, 

the  modern  industry  of  temporary  staffing  is  only  15  years  old,  
and  is  developing  rapidly.  The  number  of  temporary  workers 
recruited by labor brokers grew more than 10 percent in 2009 and 
18 percent in 2010. According to some media reports, workers are 
quitting  permanent  jobs  to  move  into  more  attractive  temporary 
roles. Some firms claim that as many as 15 percent of new recruits 
are permanent employees switching to temporary jobs.d Competi-
tion  in  the  Indian  temporary  staffing  industry  is  strong.  Agencies 
have introduced lower recruitment fees to gain more market share 
and  to  drive  growth.  Large  temporary  staffing  firms  are  entering 
niche activities such as business consulting (Manpower) and train-
ing (TeamLease).e 

As temporary staffing grows, so do calls to examine the regula-
tory  framework  of  the  industry.f  Some  of  those  calls  focus  on 
addressing vulnerability. Workers in these jobs typically face lower 
earnings  (because  a  portion  of  the  pay  is  diverted  to  temporary 
staffing  agencies).  They  also  face  a  lack  of  benefits,  coverage  by 
labor laws, and job security. Other efforts focus on professionalizing 
the industry. For instance, in 2011 TeamLease and seven other staff-
ing  firms  formed  the  Indian  Staffing  Federation  to  advocate  for 
changes  in  labor  laws  and  more  acceptance  for  the  industry  in  a 
country where a vast majority of the labor force is unorganized.

a.   Dourgarian (2011) remarks that it is not the Group of 8 countries that led the pack in the growth in the staffing industry in 2011, but the BRICs (Brazil, India, the Russian 

 Federation, and China), along with Indonesia, Mexico, and Pakistan.

Yet  in  a  majority  of  countries,  both  indus-
trial and developing, the share of labor in total 
income  is  declining.49  This  trend,  which  has 
been  observed  since  the  mid-1980s  and  early 
1990s,  has  been  attributed  to  various  forces, 
from  technological  progress  biased  toward 
skilled  workers  to  global  competition  under-
mining  workers’  bargaining  power.  The  en-
trance  of  China  and  India  in  world  trade  has 
doubled the size of the globalized labor force, 
hence reducing the price of labor relative to that 
of other factors of production.50

Changes  in  the  distribution  of  income  in  
recent years have actually taken place not only 
between  factors  of  production  but  between 
workers. Two distinctions are relevant in this re-
spect: between high- and low-skill workers, and 
between those who work in tradable sectors and 
those  who  do  not.  Tradable  sectors  produce 
goods and services that can be exported or im-
ported, such as shirts or computers. A turning 
point came in the mid-1990s, when labor earn-
ings  in  developing  countries  started  to  grow 
faster than those in industrial countries, regard-
less of level of skill. But the trend is more pro-
nounced  in  tradable  sectors,  whereas  low-skill 
workers  in  nontradable  sectors  continue  to  be 
the most disadvantaged (figure 1.8).

The  relatively  lower  wages  among  low-skill 
workers compared with high-skill workers, par-
ticularly  in  nontradable  sectors  in  developing 
countries, are consistent with an increase in re-
turns to education. Returns to education mea-
sure  the  wage  premium  on  higher  educational 
attainment for workers of the same sex with the 
same  age  and  work  experience.  In  all  regions, 
more schooling is associated with higher labor 
earnings,  but  the  gain  is  not  linear.  The  labor 
earnings of workers with tertiary education are 
double or more than those of workers with sec-
ondary education only. However, workers with 
only a secondary education earn little more than 
those with elementary education. The education 
premium  is  generally  higher  the  lower  the  in-
come level of the country (figure 1.9).

The role of the private sector

The  solution  to  all  these  demographic  and  
technological  challenges  rests  with  the  private 
sector. That does not mean that the government 

does not have a role to play. The quality of the 
civil service is critically important for develop-
ment, whether it is teachers building skills, agri-
cultural  extension  agents  improving  agricul-
tural productivity, or urban planners designing 
functional cities. Public works programs or em-
ployment  programs  for  the  demobilization  of 
combatants  are  also  justified  in  some  circum-
stances. But the private sector is the main en-
gine of job creation and the source of roughly 
nine of 10  jobs in the world. Between 1995 and 
2005, the private sector accounted for almost 90 
percent of jobs created in Brazil. In the Philip-
pines  and  Turkey,  the  fraction  reached  95 
percent.51 

But  the  most  remarkable  example  of  the 
expansion  of  employment  through  private 
sector  growth  is  the  case  of  China.  In  1981, 
private sector employment accounted for 2.3 
million workers while state-owned enterprises 
(SOEs) had 80 million workers. Two decades 
later,  employment  in  private  sector  firms  ac-
counted  for  74.7  million  workers  surpassing, 
for the first time, the 74.6 million workers in 
SOEs (figure 1.10).52 

In  contrast  to  the  global  average,  in  some 
countries in the Middle East and North Africa, 
the state keeps a leading role as an employer—a 
pattern that can be linked to the political econ-
omy  of  the  post-independence  period  and,  in 
some cases, to the abundance of oil revenues.53 
For  a  long  period,  public  sector  jobs  were  of-
fered to young college graduates. In recent years, 
however,  the  fiscal  space  for  continued  expan-
sion  in  public  sector  employment  shrank,  and 
“queuing”  for  public  sector  jobs  became  more 
prevalent, leading to increasing transitions into 
informality, a devaluation of education creden-
tials, and forms of social exclusion.54 A relatively 
well-educated  and  young  labor  force  remains 
unemployed, or underemployed, and labor pro-
ductivity stagnates.55

Vulnerability on a global scale

Jobs  are  vulnerable  to  economic  downturns—
and  much  more  so  in  the  private  than  in  the 
public  sector.  Short-term  crises  may  wipe  out 
years  of  progress.  They  may  start  in  a  single 
country and through globalization spread over 
entire  regions  or,  as  in  the  recent  one,  to  the

In 2008, the bursting of asset price bubbles 
and  the  resulting  collapse  of  financial  institu-
tions  in  the  United  States  and  some  European 
countries  initiated  a  crisis  of  worldwide  span, 

creating 22 million new unemployed in a single 
year.  Growth  in  total  employment,  which  had 
been hovering around 1.8 percent a year before 
2008, fell to less than 0.5 percent in 2009, and by

2011 had not yet returned to its pre-crisis level.57 
As  Europe  struggles  with  high  levels  of  public 
debt,  vulnerabilities  in  its  banking  sector,  and 
uncertainties about the euro, and as growth de-
celerates in China and India, it is by no means 
clear that the global crisis is over.

The  impact  of  the  2008–09  crisis  varied 
across developing countries. Some, such as the 
Baltic  countries,  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  Mexico, 
Romania, Russia, South Africa, and Turkey, had 
absolute  declines  in  employment;  other  coun-
tries such as Brazil, China, and Indonesia expe-
rienced  only  a  brief  deceleration.  Country- 
specific studies shed further light on employment 
impacts across different population groups. For 
example, it is estimated that the crisis cost China 
between 20 million and 36 million jobs, particu-
larly among migrant workers in export-oriented 
sectors.58 In Mexico, it caused a decline of half a 
 million jobs between 2008 and the second quar-
ter of 2009, particularly among women, youth, 
and older workers, as well as a 10 percent drop 
in  real  wages.59  In  Indonesia,  although  the  ef-
fects of the crisis were mild, young, casual, and 
informal workers were affected.60 Across coun-
tries, the young bore the largest brunt.61

Adjustment patterns, in terms of jobs lost or 
earnings  declines,  also  varied  in  developing 

countries. The less formalized the labor market, 
the more earnings shrank and the less employ-
ment numbers gave away. In Central and East-
ern  Europe,  where  the  labor  market  is  largely 
formalized, the growth rate of GDP dropped on 
average  by  12  percentage  points,  employment 
contracted  by  3  percent,  and  earnings  fell  by 
more than 8 percent (figure 1.11).62 In East Asia, 
where  formal  employment  rates  are  very  low, 
the average decline in GDP growth was 5.5 per-
centage points and total employment numbers 
barely changed.63 

The policy response to the crisis was unprec-
edented in its scale, but it also involved different 
combinations  of  instruments,  with  potentially 
different  implications  for  jobs.  Fiscal  stimulus 
across  the  world  amounted  to  US$5.5  trillion 
in purchasing power parity, with China, Japan,  
and the United States accounting for more than 
70  percent  of  it.64  Of  77  countries  for  which 
data  are  available,  80  percent  used  fiscal  ex-
pansion.  Higher-income  countries  favored  tax 
cuts,  higher  unemployment  benefits,  and  di-
rect support for enterprises. Low- and middle- 
income countries boosted expenditures, includ-
ing  spending  on  training  and  income-support 
measures.65 Across countries, responses mainly 
aimed at preventing or mitigating employment

BOX 1.4    Responses to the crisis went beyond income support for the unemployed

Countries worldwide used an array of policy responses to confront 
the jobs crisis. Macroeconomic stimulus and targeted sector policies 
were supplemented by policies to strengthen income support for 
those  affected;  measures  to  boost  labor  demand  through  wage  
subsidies,  credit  policies,  and  public  works  programs;  and  invest-
ments in skills and tailor-made employment services for those most 
affected. 

Globally,  unemployment  insurance  played  a  minor  role.  Only 
15.4 percent of the unemployed received benefits during the crisis, 
because of the low effective coverage of unemployment insurance 
programs.  In  23  countries  in  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Co-
operation and Development, Central Europe, and Latin America, the 
duration  of  benefits  was  extended.  Countries  with  large  informal 
sectors or without unemployment schemes relied on a mix of cash 
transfers and public works schemes to provide additional income 
support for those in need. Colombia’s Familias en Acción—a pro-
gram  focusing  on  strengthening  nutrition  and  education  for  chil-
dren—increased its coverage from 1.8 million to 2.7 million families. 
Argentina expanded the coverage of family benefits to all informal 
sector workers.

Countries across all income levels took measures to boost labor 
demand. Of the resources devoted to creating and protecting jobs, 
high-income countries spent more than half (56 percent) on credit 
policies  for  firms.  They  also  implemented  work-sharing  arrange-
ments  to  cushion  the  impact  of  the  crisis.  Take-up  rates  for  these 

initiatives reached 3.3 percent of the employed in Italy, 3.2 percent 
in Germany, and 2.7 percent in Japan. 

Low-  and  middle-income  countries  spent  67  percent  of  their 
resources  on  direct  job  creation  measures  and  public  works  pro-
grams. Mexico, for example, extended its temporary works program 
to around 250,000 workers, or 0.5 percent of the labor force. Wage 
subsides  were  popular  in  Europe.  They  were  most  often  imple-
mented  through  a  reduction  in  social  security  contributions  and 
were targeted to small and medium enterprises or to disadvantaged 
groups such as long-term job seekers and the young. To reach an 
effective scale in a timely manner, though, countries needed to have 
had such programs in place before the crisis.

In  comparison,  efforts  to  ramp  up  training,  employment  ser-
vices, or specific support programs for vulnerable groups were rela-
tively modest in scope and scale. Building or maintaining skills took 
the lion’s share of the budget in this category, with Chile, Italy, Mex-
ico, Turkey, and the United States spending the most.

Overall, countries with more mature social protection systems as 
well  as  established  employment  programs  were  able  to  respond 
quickly and reduce the impact of the crisis on jobs. With few excep-
tions, though, little is known about possible unintended effects of 
their programs such as whether preserving some jobs came at the 
expense of destroying others. Careful impact analysis is only in its 
initial stages.

losses,  rather  than  trying  to  offset  earnings 
shortfalls (box 1.4).

Demography,  urbanization,  globalization,  tech-
nological  progress,  and  macroeconomic  crises 
bring  about  formidable  jobs  challenges.  Coun-
tries  that  fail  to  address  them  may  fall  into  vi-
cious circles of slow growth in labor earnings and 
job-related dis satisfaction affecting a sizable por-

tion of the labor force.66 Youth unemployment 
and idleness may be high, and women may face 
limited job  opportunities, leaving potential eco-
nomic and social gains untapped.67 A repeating 
pattern  of  small  gains  in  living  standards,  slow 
productivity  growth,  and  eroding  social  cohe-
sion may emerge. In contrast, countries that suc-
cessfully address these job challenges can develop 
 virtuous circles. The results—prosperous popu-
lations, a growing middle class, increased produc-
tivity,  and  improved  opportunities  for  women 
and youth—may then be self-reinforcing. 

QUeStION 1

What is a job?

The world of work is diverse, especially in devel-
oping  countries,  and  it  is  changing  rapidly. 
Against this backdrop, the diversity of the words 
used to describe what people do to earn a living 
across countries and cultures should not be sur-
prising.  Even  people  who  speak  the  same  lan-
guage  can  have  vastly  different  interpretations  
of  the  meaning  of  a  job.  For  some,  the  word  
conjures  up  an  image  of  a  worker  in  an  office  
or  a  factory,  with  an  employer  and  a  regular  
paycheck.  Others  may  think  of  farmers,  self- 
employed  vendors  in  cities,  and  caregivers  of 
children or elderly relatives.

Work matters and words matter

The varied interpretations capture the different 
aspects of jobs that people value. A woman in 
Hanoi, Vietnam, explained, “an old woman who 
just sells vegetables can gain respect from others 
and  people  listen  to  her.”68  A  man  who  had 
worked his way out of poverty in Satgailijhara, 
Bangladesh, linked the value of his job as a rice 
farmer to being able to invest in his children, “I 
have  been  able  to  get  my  children  educated. 
That’s the best achievement in life.”69 

Ela  Bhatt,  a  lawyer  and  the  founder  of  Self 
Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) in In-
dia, described her struggle with the language of 
work, given the multiplicity of tasks that people 
do  every  day  and  over  time:  “A  small  farmer 
works on her own farm. In tough times, she also 
works on other farms as a laborer. When the ag-
riculture season is over, she goes to the forest to 
collect  gum  and  other  forest  produce.  Year 
round, she produces embroidered items either at 
a piece rate for a contractor or for sale to a trader 
who  comes  to  her  village  to  buy  goods.  Now, 
how should her trade be categorized? Does she 
belong to the agricultural sector, the factory sec-
tor, or the home-based work sector? Should she 
be categorized as a farmer or a farm worker? Is 
she self-employed or is she a piece-rate worker?”70
These  questions  are  not  merely  semantic. 
The  words  and  categories  that  are  used  to  de-
scribe  work  have  tangible  implications.  Views 

on what a job is and what it means almost inevi-
tably influence views on what policies for jobs 
should look like. Those for whom the word job 
is associated with the image of a worker in an 
office or a factory, with an  employer and a pay-
check,  may  focus  on  a  supportive  investment 
climate for firms. Those for whom the word also 
encompasses  farming,  street  vending,  waste 
picking,  and  domestic  employment  may  think 
of jobs policies as including land reform, agri-
cultural extension, urban policies, or the provi-
sion of voice to the most vulnerable workers.

According to the International Conference of 
Labour Statisticians (ICLS), which sets standard 
definitions for official use across countries, a job 
is “a set of tasks and duties performed, or meant 
to be performed, by one person, including for an 
employer or in self-employment.”71 Under this 
definition, a job is not the same as employment. 
The existence of job vacancies and people with 
more  than  one  job  means  that  the  number  of 
jobs is greater than the number of people em-
ployed. The existence of unemployment means 
that people do not find the jobs they want. Jobs 
refer to tasks, while the wage employed, farmers, 
and the self-employed refer to the people who 
do them.

Some gray areas

The  ICLS  definition  excludes  some  forms  of 
work  from  official  employment  statistics.  The 
employed  are  part  of  the  economically  active 
population, defined as people who contribute to 
“the  production  of  goods  and  services  as  de-
fined by the United Nations systems of national 
accounts and balances.”72 The system of national 
accounts  (SNA)  includes “all  production  actu-
ally destined for the market, whether for sale or 
barter,”  as  well  as  the  production  of  goods  for 
one’s  own  use,  but “excludes  all  production  of 
services  for  own  final  consumption  within 
households.”73 This definition thus leaves out of 
official statistics activities such as child-rearing, 
care of the elderly, or home cooking, as well as 
traveling to work.

64

Some countries are starting to develop esti-
mates  of  these  other  types  of  activities.  The 
SNA offers guidelines to countries for produc-
ing satellite accounts reflecting forms of house-
hold  work  that  are  not  considered  jobs.  Ac-
cording  to  these  guidelines,  “a  job  can  refer  
to  unpaid  household  service  and  volunteer 
work performed by one person for a household 
outside  the  SNA  production  boundary  but 
within  the  general  production  boundary.”74 
Mexico, for instance, has used this guidance to 
estimate the value of unremunerated activities 
in households, such as housekeeping and child 
care. These activities represented nearly a quar-
ter  of  Mexican  GDP  between  2003  and  2009 
and  were  equivalent  to  about  two-thirds  of 
worker wages and benefits.75 

is  another 

Informality 

important  gray  
area.  After  nearly  four  decades  of  debates 
about the concept of informality, there is still 
no  consensus  on  what  is  meant  by  informal 
jobs. Some schools of thought link informality 
to characteristics of firms—whether the busi-
ness  is  registered  or  pays  taxes.  Others  focus 
on  characteristics  of  workers—whether  they 
are  covered  by  social  protection  or  have  an 
employment  contract.  And  yet  others  stress 
modes of production and levels of productiv-
ity to define informality. A consensus is start-
ing to emerge on how to measure informality, 
but the definitions used still leave out types of 
work that some consider informal. Meanwhile, 
relatively few countries produce regular statis-
tics on informality (box 1.5).

BOX 1.5    Few countries produce statistics on informality

The concept of dual economies has an old lineage.a Based on the 
recognition of dual economies and the Harris and Todaro two-sector 
model, the term informality was first coined by a U.K. anthropologist 
in  a  paper  about  Ghana.  The  concept  gained  popularity  with  a 
widely cited report from a mission of the International Labour Orga-
nization (ILO) to Kenya.b Since then, studies on informality have pro-
liferated,  and  the  concept  has  become  standard  in  development 
studies,  labor  economics,  and  other  disciplines.  Today  the  causes 
and  implications  of  informality  are  the  subject  of  an  intense  aca-
demic  debate  and  an  extended  research  agenda  aimed  at  under-
standing how labor markets function in developing countries.c 

A  variety  of  approaches  can  be  used  to  measure  informality, 
informal  employment,  and  the  informal  sector.  Measurement  be- 
comes  even  more  complex  when  informality  is  combined  with 
other concepts like illegal and underground activities or nonstan-
dard work. The lack of systematic country-level data on informality 
has led researchers to construct their own estimates using similar 
but  not  identical  criteria,  which  sometimes  lead  to  diverging 
conclusions.

Recommendations on the measurement of informality were first 
drafted  in  1993  by  the  15th  International  Conference  of  Labour 
 Statisticians (ICLS). Four years later, the United Nations created the 
Delhi  Group  to  document  and  recommend  methods  for  defining 
and collecting data on the informal sector. In 2003, the 17th ICLS, 
through the document “Guidelines Concerning a Statistical Defini-
tion of Informal Employment,” introduced a definition of informal 
employment and a series of rules for its measurement. Since 2006, 

the Delhi Group has been working with the ILO on a forthcoming 
“Manual of Surveys of Informal Employment and Informal Sector.” In 
2008, the newest version of the United Nation’s system of national 
accounts adopted most of the previous resolutions and recommen-
dations on the measurement of informality. That resulted in a broad 
definition  that  includes  both  the  informal  sector  and  informal 
employment.  However,  gray  areas  remain  in  relation  to  activities 
such as farming, independent professionals, and activities among 
rural workers in general.

Few countries produce regular official statistics on informality. 
The  dearth  of  data  is  apparent  in  global  repositories  such  as  the 
ILO’s Key Indicators of the Labor Market database, which, in its most 
recent version, includes data on informality for only 60 countries.d A 
report  on  informality  across  the  world  by  the  ILO  and  Women  in 
Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing (WIEGO) makes 
systematic use of the most thorough definition of informality, cover-
ing  informal  employment  and  employment  in  informal  firms,  to 
present data on 47 countries.e The ILO-WIEGO report shows infor-
mality rates ranging from 40 percent in Uruguay and 42 percent in 
Thailand to 75 percent in Bolivia and 80 percent in India.

The extent of informality varies with differences in productivity 
across firms and workers, as well as with differences in the nature of 
regulations  and  the  degree  to  which  they  are  enforced.  Whether 
informality is the result of exit, exclusion, uneven enforcement, or 
low firm productivity is still a matter of debate. Better measurement 
can provide information on the magnitude of informality and pro-
vide more data for the advancement of studies in this area.

What is not a job?

While  views  about  what  a  job  means  vary,  a 
broad consensus exists on the types of activities 
that should never be considered a job. Interna-
tional  norms  define  basic  human  rights  as  the 
boundaries of what is unacceptable. The United 
Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
which  the  UN  General  Assembly  embraced 
unanimously in 1948, provides for the right to 
work and protection from discrimination.76 The 
Declaration on Fundamental Rights and Princi-
ples at Work adopted at the ILO conference in 
1998 further specifies core labor standards that 
call for an end to forced and compulsory labor, 
child  labor,  and  labor  discrimination,  and  that 
provide  for  freedom  of  association  and  collec-
tive  bargaining.77  Most  countries  have  ratified 
the conventions on forced labor, child labor, and 
discrimination; fewer have ratified the conven-
tions  on  freedom  of  association  and  collective 
bargaining (figure 1.12).78

While  international  agreements  help  define 
what forms of work are unacceptable, in prac-
tice many people work in activities that violate 
their  rights.  Some  21  million  people  are  esti-
mated to be subject to forced labor, and around 
1 million to trafficking.79 In many cases, forced 
labor is inflicted upon minorities or groups that 

are  discriminated  against,  such  as  migrants, 
women, and indigenous people. Migrant work-
ers  in  sweatshops  in  Latin  America,  child  sol-
diers in conflict-afflicted areas of Africa, people 
trafficked for sexual exploitation in Europe and 
Asia,  and  temporary  migrant  workers  under 
sponsorship  contracts  in  the  Middle  East  are  
the subjects of the most conspicuous forms of 
forced labor and trafficking in the world.

Child labor provides another striking exam-
ple (box 1.6). Although it is covered by the core 
labor standards and many countries have rati-
fied the relevant ILO conventions and the UN 
Convention on the Rights of the Child, the ILO 
estimates  that  115  million  children  worldwide 
were involved in hazardous work in 2008. Mea-
surement  is  complicated  by  legal  and  moral 
concerns, as well as by the flawed design of sur-
veys that may induce parents to misreport chil-
dren’s work.80 These statistics may actually rep-
resent only a lower boundary on the size of the 
problem. 

Recent research shows that children work for 
diverse and complex reasons.81 They range from 
household  poverty  to  the  relative  accessibility 
and  affordability  of  schooling  and  from  the 
preferences  of  families  and  even  children  re-
garding work and play to the influence of tech-
nological  change,  international  trade,  and  ur-

BOX 1.6    Not all child work is child labor

According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), children engaged in 
child  labor  include  “all  persons  aged  between  5  and  17  years  who  during  a 
specified time period were engaged in one or more of the following activities: 
(a) hazardous work; (b) worst forms of child labor other than hazardous work; 
and (c) other forms of child labor (depending on age of the child and weekly 
hours worked).”a The “worst forms of child labor” include any work that jeopar-
dizes the health, safety, or morals of a child. Such work is determined to be haz-
ardous depending on its specific nature, the demands on children in particular 
industries,  and  the  general  working  conditions.  Apart  from  hazardous  work, 
the worst forms of child labor include all forms of slavery, bondage, military 
conscription, trafficking, and using, procuring, or offering children for prostitu-
tion, pornography, or other illicit activities.

This definition of child labor is governed by two ILO Conventions (132 and 
182), two ILO recommendations (146 and 190), and the UN Convention on the 
Rights  of  the  Child.  However,  international  standards  also  provide  countries 
with some latitude in setting allowed boundaries for the involvement of chil-
dren  in  productive  activities  (regarding  ages  or  the  definition  of  hazardous 
work, for example). The standards also permit limited work in the performance 
of household chores or in light productive activities that are not considered 
harmful.

banization.  Children  in  wealthier  households 
may, in some settings, be engaged in child labor 
if household assets and access to finance, land, 
or  other  resources  generate  more  demand  for 
work  from  household  members.82  Child  labor 

may affect schooling, health, fertility, and behav-
ior,  although  establishing  these  links  has  been 
challenging.  Rarely  is  there  a  one-to-one  trad-
eoff between school and work. In many places, 
the majority of children who work are also at-
tending  school.  Moreover,  a  child  may  have 
dropped out of school for reasons unrelated to 
child  labor.  The  participation  of  children  12 
years  and  older  in  family  farming  and  small 
household  enterprises  can  in  some  cases  con-
tribute to the acquisition of skills.83 

In sum, jobs are activities that generate actual 
income, monetary or in kind, and do not violate 
fundamental  rights  and  principles  at  work.  
This  definition  includes  the  categories  of  work 
covered by ICLS guidelines: wage or salary em-
ployment, employers, members of cooperatives,  
family workers (including unpaid family mem-
bers), and the self-employed. In many instances, 
however, these categories may fail to uniquely or 
clearly classify certain individuals. For instance, 
small farmers are sometimes wage employed or 
self-employed, but they may also be employers  
if they hire unpaid family workers. Jobs include 
labor  activities  that  generate  income  for  the 
household, even if no income measure can be at-
tributed to a person’s specific labor, as in the case 
of household enterprises and farming.

By  this  definition,  jobs  are  much  broader 
than just working in an office or a factory, with 
an employer and a regular paycheck.

52.  The  definition  of  “private  sector”  in  China  is 
broad and sometimes not clearly defined in offi-
cial  statistics.  There  is  differentiation  between 
what are labeled “private firms” (a profit-making 
unit invested in and established by natural per-
sons or controlled by persons hiring more than 
seven  workers)  and  “individual  firms”  (those 
with  fewer  than  eight  employees).  Foreign- 
invested firms and collectives are not part of the 
private sector in official statistics. For more de-
tails, see Kanamori and Zhao (2004).

PART1

Jobs are transformational

Introduction to Part 1

Economic development is about improve-

ments  in  living  standards  supported  by 
productivity growth. It also involves so-
cial change associated with urbanization, inte-
gration  in  the  world  economy,  and  the  drive 
toward gender equality. All of these transforma-
tions are related to jobs. The development pro-
cess  is  about  some  jobs  becoming  better  and 
others  disappearing,  about  people  taking  jobs 
and  changing  jobs,  and  about  jobs  migrating  
to  other  places  within  and  across  countries.  
Development  often  entails  the  movement  of  
labor from rural, agricultural, and mostly sub-
sistence activities to urban, nonagricultural, and 
mostly  market-oriented  activities.  This  move-
ment transforms the lives of families and com-
munities,  the  organization  of  firms,  and  the 
norms and values of societies. It can boost pro-
ductivity and improve living standards and also 
affect the cohesiveness of society. Jobs are thus a 
key driver of development.
•  Living standards: Jobs provide earnings op-
portunities to lift people out of poverty, raise 
their  consumption,  and  contribute  to  indi-
vidual well-being more broadly. 

•  Productivity: Through job creation and de-
struction  within  sectors  and  reallocations 
across sectors and countries, jobs are also at 
the root of economic growth.

•  Social cohesion: Jobs define who people are 
in  many  ways;  by  shaping  values  and  be-

haviors,  they  can  influence  trust  and  civic 
engagement.

Distinguishing these three transformations pro-
vides an understanding of how jobs contribute 
to development. People’s well-being is the ulti-
mate  goal,  and  the  transformation  of  living 
standards  captures  this  link  directly.  But  sus-
tained improvements in living standards are im-
possible  without  productivity  growth  or  when 
resources  are  wasted  through  confrontation. 
That is why it is necessary to look at the three 
transformations jointly.

Jobs and living standards

Jobs are the main source of income for the majority of households and a 
key driver of poverty reduction. But their contribution to well-being goes 
beyond the earnings they provide.

Jobs  are  the  most  important  determinant  

of  living  standards  around  the  world.  For 
the vast majority of people, their work is the 
main source of income, especially in the poorest 
countries. And jobs-related events are the most 
frequent  reasons  for  families  to  escape  or  fall 
into poverty. Furthermore, as earnings increase, 
individual  choices  expand—household  mem-
bers can opt to stay out of the labor force or to 
work  fewer  hours  and  dedicate  more  time  to 
education, retirement, or family. Opportunities 
for  gainful  work,  including  in  farming  and  
self-employment, offer households the means to 
increase consumption and reduce its variability. 
Higher crop yields, access to small off-farm en-
terprise activities, the migration of family mem-
bers to cities, and transitions to wage employ-
ment are milestones on the path to prosperity. 
In addition to their fundamental and imme-
diate contribution to earnings, jobs affect other 
dimensions of well-being, positively and nega-
tively.  Not  having  a  job  undermines  mental 
health, especially in countries where wage em-
ployment is the norm and the lack of employ-
ment opportunities translates into open unem-
ployment rather than underemployment. But a 
job  prone  to  occupational  accidents  or  work-
related  diseases  can  damage  physical  health  or 
worse. More generally, monetary, nonmonetary, 
and even subjective characteristics of jobs can all 
have an impact on well-being (box 2.1).

Jobs  also  influence  how  workers  see  them-
selves and relate to others. Most people feel that 
jobs should be meaningful and contribute to so-
ciety. Together with other objective job charac-
teristics, the self-esteem a job provides is an im-
portant determination of satisfaction with life. 

Jobs improve material well-being

Over  the  course  of  a  country’s  development, 
higher  productivity  and  labor  earnings  allow 
households  to  allocate  more  time  to  invest-
ment  and  consumption  activities  and  less  to 
production.  Thus,  schooling  and  retirement 
gain importance relative to work. For the past 
century or so, the number of hours worked by 
youth  in  industrial  countries  has  declined 
steadily  as  access  to  education  has  increased. 
Similarly,  the  number  of  years  in  retirement 
has increased in parallel with longer life expec-
tancy.1  Higher  earnings  also  facilitate  longer 
periods  of 
job  seeking,  especially  among 
younger household members, often leading to 
higher unemployment rates. Among men and 
women of prime age (25 to 54), total working 
hours (market and nonmarket) have remained 
relatively  stable,  with  the  main  change  being 
the growing share of market activities among 
women  (figure  2.1).  These  general  trends  are 
not ironclad, however.

BOX 2.1    There are many dimensions of living standards and many ways to measure them

Debates on how to define and measure living standards go far back 
in social sciences. The work by Rowntree and Booth in late 19th cen-
tury England is usually mentioned as seminal, especially in relation 
to the measurement of poverty. In the 1930s, the creation of the Sys-
tem of National Accounts concentrated on measuring the total mar-
ket value of the goods and services produced in an economy and 
made gross domestic product (GDP) per capita the main indicator 
of living standards in general. By the 1970s and 1980s, there was a 
growing agreement that important aspects of well-being, such as 
health status, or exposure to crime, pollution, and urban conges-
tion, were not fully accounted for in GDP. Research also showed that 
the  distribution  of  material  amenities  affected  individual  well-
being.  There  is  now  consensus  that  living  standards  depend  not 
only on average incomes and consumption but also on access to 
benefits as diverse as health and education, sanitation and housing, 
and security and freedom.a

There  are  ongoing  systematic  efforts  to  collect  individual, 
household,  and  community  data  to  better  understand  and  com-
pare living standards in developing and developed countries. Com-
plete poverty profiles for different groups of the population within 
a  country,  based  on  the  comparison  of  income  or  consumption 
aggregates to international or national poverty lines, have prolifer-
ated. Microdata collection efforts have allowed a close monitoring 

of standards of living and poverty reduction worldwide. Advances 
toward the first Millennium De velopment Goal (Eradicate extreme 
poverty)  have  been  documented  using  global  monetary  poverty 
measures. The availability of richer datasets, in turn, has supported 
the  emergence  of  newer  measures  of  living  standards,  many  of 
them  multidimensional  in  nature.  These  measures  combine  both 
monetary  and  nonmonetary  indicators  of  well-being,  as  well  
as  information  on  their  distribution  across  different  population 
groups.b

Despite this progress, important controversies remain, particu-
larly  on  which  indicators  are  more  appropriate  for  gauging  each 
dimension of well-being and on the weights that should be attrib-
uted to each. Some recent proposals even suggest a revamping of 
statistical systems to formulate better measures of production that 
take  into  consideration  changes  in  the  quality  of  goods,  govern-
ment  services,  and  time  allocated  to  home  activities  and  leisure. 
There are also proposals to include among measures of living stan-
dards subjective indicators of well-being and indicators on the level 
and  sustainability  of  human,  physical,  and  environmental  assets.c 
Other proposals emphasize subjective indicators building on a phil-
osophical  point  of  view.d  Aggregating  indicators  and  comparing 
them  over  time  and  across  space  becomes  more  intricate  in  this 
case, because of differences in values and beliefs.

The  nature  of  production,  consumption, 
and  investment  activities  varies  across  coun-
tries as well. In some, low hours of work among 
youth  are  associated  more  with  idleness  than 
with  schooling;  in  others,  schooling  has  pro-
ceeded  at  an  accelerated  pace.  Similarly,  job 
characteristics  change  with  development.  In  
rural  economies  where  agricultural  activities 
predominate,  the  purpose  of  household  pro-
duction  is  often  direct  consumption.  Less  de-
veloped  economies  tend  to  be  characterized  
by more working time dedicated to jobs with-
out  wage  payments,  including  farming  and 
other types of self-employment. Development 
changes  the  organization  of  work  from  home  
to market production.2 As economies develop, 
more work is remunerated through wages and 
salaries.  This  reallocation  is  usually  accompa-

nied  by  higher  market  participation  among 
women.3  Developed  and  developing  econ- 
omies  allocate  a  similar  share  of  the  day  to 
work.  But  women  allocate  a  larger  share  than 
men to activities not directly generating income  
(figure 2.2). 

Jobs  do  not  automatically  guarantee  sus-
tained  improvements  in  earnings  and  well- 
being.  Working  people  often  remain  mired  in 
poverty.  In  many  countries,  adults  in  poor 
households are more likely to be working than 
those in nonpoor households. The poor are not 
usually characterized by lack of jobs or hours of 
work;  they  often  have  more  than  one  job  and 
work long hours, but their jobs are poorly remu-
nerated (box 2.2).

In  more  affluent  societies,  a  larger  share  of 
income is derived from capital, transfers (social

assistance),  or  savings  (social  insurance  and 
pensions).  Still,  the  majority  of  households 
worldwide make their living through their work, 
and labor earnings represent the largest share of 
total household income (figure 2.3). The main 
change  that  comes  with  development  is  the 
composition of labor income.4

Job-related events are the main escape route 
from  poverty  in  developing  and  developed 
countries  alike.  More  than  two  decades  of  re-
search on poverty dynamics, spanning countries 
as different as Canada, Ecuador, Germany, and 
South  Africa,  show  that  labor-related  events 
trigger  household  exits  from  poverty  (figure 
2.4).  These  events  range  from  the  head  of  a 
household taking a new job, to family members 
starting  to  work,  to  working  family  members 
earning more from their labor. In a large set of 

qualitative studies in low-income countries, get-
ting jobs and starting businesses were two of the 
main  reasons  people  gave  to  explain  their  rise 
out  of  poverty.5  Conversely,  a  lack  of  job  op-
portunities reduces the ability of households to 
improve their well-being.6

Jobs  are  not  the  only  force  that  determines 
whether a household escapes from poverty. De-
mographic changes, such as the arrival of a new-
born,  relatives  moving  in,  or  a  family  split  be-
cause of death or separation, affect expenditures 
per capita, hence the household’s poverty status. 
The same is true of changes in nonlabor income 
from  assets  or  transfers,  be  they  private  remit-
tances,  public  social  assistance,  or  pensions. 
These developments may all interact and often 
occur  simultaneously.  For  example,  the  migra-
tion of family members to a city for a job may

improve the well-being not only of the migrants 
but also of those who stay in the rural village. In 
addition to receiving remittances, those who stay 
behind may have access to the migrants’ land to 
cultivate and work more as a result.7

With all these changes occurring at the same 
time, gauging the contribution of labor earnings 
to poverty reduction is difficult. However, recent 
methods allowing to decompose changes in pov-
erty  by  sources  of  income  confirm  the  funda-
mental contribution of change in labor earnings 
(figure 2.5). In 10 of 18 countries considered for 
the  analysis,  labor  income  explains  more  than 
half of the change in poverty, as measured by the 
US$2.50-a-day poverty line. In another 5 coun-
tries,  it  accounts  for  more  than  a  third  of  the 
 reduction in poverty.8 A further decomposition 
of the contribution of labor income to poverty 
reduction  in  Bangladesh,  Peru,  and  Thailand 
found that changes in individual characteristics 

(education, work experience, or region of resi-
dence)  were  important,  but  that  the  returns  
to  these  characteristics  mattered  more. Among 
those returns is the relative price of labor. 9

The  connection  between  jobs  and  poverty 
reduction is not mechanistic, and not all transi-
tions out of poverty require a change in the type 
of work undertaken. Changes in the productiv-
ity of the same job may also be at play. In Ban-
gladesh and Vietnam, for example, poverty tran-
sitions have been dominated not by changes in 
income sources from farm to nonfarm income, 
but by higher income within the same sector.10 
Richer  insights  on  the  connection  between 
labor-related events and transitions out of pov-
erty  can  be  obtained  from  studies  that  follow  
the same households over extended periods of 
time. Studies in several countries in Asia and in 
Sub-Saharan Africa show that farming and off-
farm  activities  are  intricately  related  and  not

BOX 2.2    Most poor people work

It  is  not  lack  of  work  that  defines  the  poor.  This  realization  has 
brought to the fore the concept of the working poor, and questions 
about  who  they  are,  and  why  they  remain  poor  even  when  they 
have jobs. First studied by researchers in some countries such as the 
United States, this concept of the working poor is now recognized 
globally. The International Labour Organization (ILO) has included 
the working poor in its statistics since the mid-1990s, and measure-
ments of this group have been added as a Millennium Development 
indicator.

The  working  poor  are  defined  as  employed  persons  in  house-
holds whose members are living below one of the two international 
poverty lines—either US$1.25 or US$2 a day.a Household expendi-
ture surveys allow for a classification of the population as poor and 
nonpoor, based on the level of consumption per person. These sur-
veys  also  provide  information  on  household  members  who  work. 
According to the ILO’s most recent estimate, 910 million workers—
nearly 30 percent of total global employment—were living on less 
than US$2 a day.b The incidence is much higher among low-income 
countries. It reaches 63.7 percent in Africa and 54.2 percent in Asia.c

Caution is needed in interpreting this concept, however. Outside 
the group of the working poor, there may be individuals who have 
very low labor earnings but whose expenditures are above the pov-
erty line because they have other sources of income such as private 
transfers or earnings from social insurance or social assistance pro-
grams. In other words, being excluded from the category of working 
poor does not mean one has high labor earnings.

Another  concept  that  indicates  whether  job  earnings  are 
 sufficient  to  ensure  an  adequate  standard  of  living  for  a  person  
or  a  household  is  the  living  wage.  This  is  the  level  of  earnings  
that  would  provide  a  satisfactory  standard  of  living  to  workers  
and their families. But moving from this definition to measurement  
is  difficult.  With  more  than  half  of  all  working  people  engaged  
in  nonwage  work,  accurate  measures  of  labor  earnings  may  not  
be  available.  Moreover,  there  are  diverse  interpretations  of  what 
constitutes a standard family and a lack of consensus on computa-
tion methods.d An alternative is measuring the percentage of the 
population that cannot reach the poverty line with labor incomes 
only, as the Poverty Labor Trend Index in Mexico does.e

labor events

Note: Nonlabor events include changes in nonlabor earnings (such as rents or pensions) and demographic changes. A trigger event is defined as the most important event occurring  
during a poverty reduction spell among a set of mutually exclusive categories of events such as changes in family structure, in sources of income, and in needs of the household.

necessarily substitutes for each other. Access to 
land, increases in farm yields, and access to mar-
kets are fundamental for the growth of off-farm 
jobs and hence for diversification in family in-
comes.11 Simply having work is not what mat-
ters most, according to these studies, since most 
people work in rural economies. What is impor-
tant  for  escaping  poverty  is  deriving  greater 
earnings from work.

Other  factors  of  production  are  critical  for 
explaining  poverty  reduction  through  jobs, 
particularly in rural areas. Studies from Uganda 
and Pakistan, using rural data spanning 4 and 
10 years respectively, show that higher agricul-
tural productivity, the growing commercializa-
tion of agriculture, and an increase in cash crop 
production  contributed  substantially  to  pov-
erty reduction. The increase in the price of cash 
crops over this period also helped.12 Improve-
ments in land rights and better access to input 
and  output  markets,  due  to  infrastructure  in-

vestments, also raised the odds of escaping pov-
erty, particularly in Uganda. All of these factors 
affect  the  labor  productivity  of  farmers  but 
originate  in  land  markets  or  food  markets 
rather than labor markets.

The largest poverty reductions documented 
are associated with jobs in agriculture. The cases 
of China and Vietnam, in the 1980s and 1990s 
respectively, testify to the importance of agricul-
tural  productivity  and  the  forces  unleashed  by 
land reform, investments in rural infrastructure, 
and off-farm job opportunities.13 In rural China, 
poverty reduction was associated with off-farm 
activities, but the workers engaged in these ac-
tivities  tended  to  be  those  who  had  benefited 
from increased farm incomes and by obtaining 
more education.14 Furthermore, easier access to 
off-farm employment and opportunities for mi-
gration reduced the exposure of households to 
income shocks. A similar pattern of events has 
been  documented  in  other  Asian  and  Sub-

Sources: Azevedo and others 2012; Inchauste and others 2012; both for the World Development Report 2013.
Note: Family composition indicates the change in the share of adults (ages 18 and older) within the household. Labor income refers to the change in employment and earnings for 
each adult. Nonlabor income refers to changes in other sources of income such as transfers, pensions, and imputed housing rents. If a bar is located below the horizontal axis, it 
means that that source would have increased, instead of decreased, poverty. The changes are computed for Argentina (2000–10); Bangladesh (2000–10); Brazil (2001–09); Chile 
(2000–09); Colombia (2002–10); Costa Rica (2000–08); Ecuador (2003–10); El Salvador (2000­09); Ghana (1998–2005); Honduras (1999–2009); Mexico (2000–10); Moldova (2001–10); 
Panama (2001–09); Paraguay (1999–2010); Peru (2002–10); Nepal (1996–2003); Romania (2001–09); and Thailand (2000–09). The changes for Bangladesh, Ghana, Moldova, Nepal, 
Peru, Romania, and Thailand are computed using consumption­based measures of poverty, while the changes for the other countries are based on income measures.

Saharan African countries. Whereas poverty re-
duction in rural areas in Asia is associated with 
diversification  into  nonfarm  activities,  in  Sub-
Saharan Africa,  it  may  be  more  closely  associ-
ated with increases in farm productivity.15 

Jobs and relapses into poverty are also con-
nected.  Widespread  shocks  such  as  droughts, 
floods, and conflicts can drive households into 
poverty or even chronic poverty. Events specific 
to individuals, such as illness or poor health of 
the head of household, can have the same effect. 
In  these  cases  it  is  not  joblessness  per  se  that 
pushes families into poverty but rather the de-
struction  of  personal  and  household  assets.16 
And even taking these shocks into account, job 
loss of the head of household remains a critical 
determinant of a fall into poverty.17

The poor clearly rely on their labor to make  
a  living.  The  death  or  disability  of  an  income 
earner  significantly increases the odds of falling 
into  poverty  or  remaining  poor,  particularly 

among households with few assets. Studies from 
Uganda  and  Pakistan  show  that  the  share  of 
household members who work also has a con-
siderable  impact.  Households  with  rising  de-
pendency  ratios  were  more  likely  to  remain 
poor  or  fall  into  poverty,  while  households 
whose  share  of  working-age  adults  increased 
were less likely to fall into poverty or remain in a 
state of poverty.18

Jobs are more than just earnings

Jobs have consequences beyond wages and earn-
ings.  Other  aspects  such  as  workplace  safety, 
 stability,  commuting  time,  learning  and  ad-
vancement  opportunities,  entitlements  to  pen-
sion benefits, and other amenities are highly val-
ued by some workers. However, quantifying the 
monetary value of these other aspects of a job  
is  not  easy.  Comparable  surveys  in  Jianyang,

BOX 2.3   The value of job attributes can be quantified through hedonic pricing

Workers place a value on jobs that goes beyond income. At the indi-
vidual  level,  people  assess  the  impact  a  job  might  have  on  their 
physical and mental well-being, as well as on their families. In addi-
tion to the earnings the job provides, they can value the stability of 
a job, its earnings, the possibilities of advancement, or the flexibility 
of working hours. Workers might also value how well a job connects 
them to society, the prestige associated with it, or its contribution to 
social goals.

Hedonic pricing assesses how people value specific job charac-
teristics through their job satisfaction or happiness more broadly. 
Indicators  of  subjective  well-being  are  linked  through  sta tistical 
analysis to various job characteristics, including earnings. Statistical 
methods can be used to assess the contribution of each of these job 
characteristics to happiness or job satisfaction.

The weights associated with different job characteristics in the 
estimated hedonic price function allow an assessment of the value 
workers attach to each job characteristic. The monetary value of a 
job characteristic can be assessed by comparing the corresponding 
weight in the hedonic price function with the weight of earnings. 
Thus, for instance, a hedonic function reveals the share of earnings 
respondents would be willing to forgo in exchange for stability, or  
for creativity at work, or for a job providing voice in the workplace.b

Using surveys commissioned for this Report, hedonic valuation 
of health insurance benefits range from 1.5 percent of hourly wages 

in Colombia and China to 4.2 percent in Egypt and 5.1 percent in 
Sierra Leone.a This is significantly lower than the explicit valuations 
answered  by  those  surveyed:  4.9  percent  in  China,  10  percent  in 
Colombia and Sierra Leone, and, at the highest, 25 percent in Egypt. 
This indicates that the revealed preference of individuals for health 
insurance benefits in the job are lower than the price they express 
they would be willing to pay. Hedonic pricing can also identify the 
revealed  preference  to  pay  for  other  less  tangible  job  charac-
teristics.  Salaried  workers  in  Colombia,  China,  and  Egypt  would 
forgo up to 1.5 percent of hourly wages for jobs that are “meaning-
ful.” In Egypt, salaried workers reveal a price tag equivalent of up  
to  2.1  percent  of  hourly  wages  for  jobs  that  are  non-manual  or 
nonroutine. 

This  approach  is  especially  relevant  in  the  assessment  of  job 
benefits.  These  benefits  involve  a  deduction  from  earnings  in  ex-  
change for access to a pension in old age, for instance. Jobholders 
typically value these benefits, but they may value them less than the 
associated deductions in earnings through social security contribu-
tions.  If  the  expected  value  of  the  pension  is  low  or  uncertain,  
they may prefer to remain in the informal sector. In contrast, a well-
designed  program  that  allows  longevity  risks  to  be  pooled  with 
other  jobholders  may  be  valued  by  the  jobholder  more  than  the 
deductions associated with participation.

China; Risaralda, Colombia; Cairo and Fayoum, 
the Arab Republic of Egypt; and Port Loko and 
Free  Town,  Sierra  Leone,  showed  the  limited 
ability of respondents to attach a monetary value 
to job benefits, despite expressing willingness to 
pay.19 Among those who do give an explicit valu-
ation, the willingness to pay for pension benefits 
goes from 5 percent of monthly wages in China 
to  7  percent  in  Colombia  and  13  percent  in 
Egypt. Lower values are given for transportation 
allowances (2, 1, and 7 percent, respectively), but 
having a permanent contract is valued more, es-
pecially in Egypt (3, 8, and 22 percent, respec-
tively) (box 2.3).

Characteristics of jobs have other less tan-
gible, but no less real, effects on well-being. In  
particular,  jobs  can  have  a  direct  impact  on 
workers’  health,  a  key  component  of  human 
development  and  personal  well-being  (box 
2.4). Ex posure to hazardous substances causes 
an   estimated  651,000  deaths  annually,  mainly 
in  developing  countries.  Work-related  acci-

dents and diseases kill an average of 6,000 peo-
ple a day, or 2.2 million a year. Most of these 
deaths  (1.7  million)  result  from  work-related 
diseases; the remainder is linked to fatal acci-
dents in the workplace and during commutes 
to or from work.20 Every year, more than 400 
million people (nearly 15 percent of the global 
labor force) suffer from occupational accidents 
or illnesses involving work-related diseases. In 
some  cases,  the  incidence  is  intolerably  high: 
half of slate pencil workers in India and 37 per-
cent of the miners in Latin America suffer from 
some  stage  of  silicosis  (an  occupational  lung 
disease  caused  by  inhalation  of  silica  dust).21 
Mental health can be threatened by abusive re-
lations  between  managers  and  workers  and 
sexual  harassment.  Health  risks  are  not  con-
fined to wage employment. Collecting and car-
rying  water  or  cooking  over  open  stoves,  as 
many  self-employed  workers  do,  poses  risks, 
and these risks are more likely to  affect women 
than men.22

BOX 2.4    Work can pose risks to health and safety

Surveys  of  workers  in  garment  factories  in  three  countries  underscore  the 
health and safety hazards they face in their jobs. Garment workers in Indonesia, 
Jordan, and Haiti have reported physical stresses linked to work, including hun-
ger, thirst, and severe fatigue.

In Indonesia, more than half the workers surveyed reported that they had 
experienced severe thirst often or every day. Heat is a likely contributor. Asked 
whether the factory is too hot or too cold, only about half (52 percent) reported 
that temperature was not a concern. Occupational safety is an issue for many: 
59 percent of workers reported concerns about dangerous equipment; 73 per-
cent were concerned about accidents; 64 percent, about dusty or polluted air; 
and 69 percent, about chemical odors.

In factories in Jordan, 37 percent of workers reported concerns about dan-
gerous  equipment,  and  45  percent  reported  concerns  about  accidents  and 
injuries.

In Haiti, 40 percent of workers reported that they had experienced severe 
fatigue or exhaustion occasionally, often, or every day; 41 percent reported 
frequent headaches, dizziness, backaches, or neck aches. A stunning 63 per-
cent  of  workers  reported  that  they  had  experienced  severe  thirst  often  or 
every day.

Occupational  accidents  and  work-related 
diseases  have  economic  costs.  These  costs  are 
difficult  to  compute  because  the  estimates 
ought to include spending on health care and 
sickness  benefits,  as  well  as  the  forgone  earn-
ings from workdays lost. Estimating these costs 
is  particularly  difficult  in  the  case  of  the  self-
employed. The few studies that have tried to do 
so suggest that the burden on society could be 
high.  In  Spain,  in  the  industrial  sector  alone, 
these  costs  were  estimated  to  amount  to  1.72 
percent  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in 
2004. In Mauritius, the cost of work-related in-
juries  represented around 2.8 percent of GDP 
in  2003.23  Global  estimates  put  the  cost  asso-
ciated with work-related sickness at around 4 
percent of GDP.24

Opportunities to participate in labor markets 
for people with disabilities vary across countries. 
The employment ratio of people with disabilities 
ranges from 70 percent, in Poland, to 20 percent, 
in Switzerland and Zambia, lower than the ratio 
for the overall population.25 Disabilities may be 
preexisting conditions or the result of job-related 
injuries or conditions. Different labor outcomes 
among persons with disabilities stem from pro-
ductivity differentials, from disincentives created 

by  the  system  of  social  benefits,  and  from  dis-
crimination.  In  any  case,  a  lower  employment 
rate is one of the main channels through which 
disability may lead to poverty.

In  countries  where  wage  employment  is  
the norm, joblessness may severely affect well-
being. Together with income, social status has 
been recognized as an important factor in the 
development  and  maintenance  of  mental 
health.26 Studies document the detrimental ef-
fects of unemployment and the positive effects 
when  finding  a  job.27  Medical  research  has  as-
sociated unemployment with stress, depression, 
heart  disease,  and  alcoholism.28  Psychological 
hardship, marital dissolutions, and suicide have 
also been associated with job loss.29 Depression 
and  stress-related  illnesses  are  becoming  more 
common  with  the  expansion  of  outsourcing,  
labor informality, and mobility in the modern 
workplace.30

The  impact  of  unemployment  on  mental 
health  appears  to  occur  independently  of  the 
availability of social insurance or other mecha-
nisms of protection.31 This is because the psy-
chological  hardship  of  unemployment  is  also 
associated with social stigma. Studies show that 
a worker who is unemployed or who has a vul-
nerable job faces less duress if the phenomenon 
is more pervasive or if there is less inequality in 
the incidence of unemployment or the distribu-
tion  of  vulnerable  jobs.  This  finding  demon-
strates the close interaction between a person’s 
job and their place in society.32

Jobs and life satisfaction

Happiness, both a personal goal and a social as-
piration, is related to employment status. A large 
body of literature shows that unemployed peo-
ple report lower happiness and life satisfaction 
than  their  employed  counterparts.33  For  in-
stance,  in  Indonesia  subjective  well-being  in-
creases when gaining a job and decreases when 
losing it.34 Some researchers argue that this dis-
content is transitory, but others point out that, 
as  long  as  concerns  about  job  stability  persist,  
so does un happiness. This “unhappiness effect” 
is  more  typically  reported  in  men  than  in 
women, but evidence indicates that women are 
affected by the unemployment of their spouse. 

 

Jobs and living standards   

85

The  lack  of  employment  can  lower  the  self- 
esteem and undermine the  social status of other 
family members.35

When  jobs  are  in  short  supply  and  unem-
ployment  becomes  a  problem,  people  change 
their expectations and attitudes. Data from the 
World Value Surveys for a large set of countries 
(both  developed  and  developing)  show  that 
higher unemployment rates are associated with 
lower  ambitions  to  do  meaningful  work,  per-
haps indicating that a lack of available jobs im-
pels individuals to accept any job. 

It is not only one’s joblessness that may be 
important  to  life  satisfaction.  In  the  United 
Kingdom, the unemployed are less unhappy in 
districts  in  which  the  unemployment  rate  is 
higher, suggesting that joblessness always hurts 
but that it hurts less if there are many unem-
ployed people in the local area.36 The effect on 
happiness of not having a job seems to be par-
tially  offset  by  the  lower  social  stigma  when  
the lack of jobs is widespread. Joblessness also 
leads to a loss of contact with people through 
the  workplace  and  to  a  contraction  in  related 
social networks, which can erode social capital 
and undermine the sense of engagement with 
others.37

Simply  having  a  job  does  not  guarantee 
higher life satisfaction. Feeling insecure at work 
because of earnings variability, job instability, or 
health and safety concerns also affects a person’s 
sense  of  well-being  (figure  2.6).38  For  wage 
workers,  the  type  of  contract  and  its  duration 
are important; part-timers and seasonal work-
ers  express  less  job  satisfaction.  Even  workers 
with long-term contracts may feel insecure.39 In 
factories  in  Haiti,  Jordan,  and  Vietnam,  earn-
ings from work did not influence the reported 
level of life satisfaction, but working conditions 
did.40  In  more  developed  countries,  jobs  that 
provide more autonomy are linked to higher life 
satisfaction.41

Most research on the links between jobs and 
life satisfaction has been conducted in settings 
where wage employment is the norm. A grow-
ing literature on life satisfaction in developing 
regions,  where  a  smaller  share  of  those  who 
work are wage earners, shows that farmers have 
the  lowest  levels  of  life  satisfaction  relative  to 
other  workers  and  the  unemployed  (figure 
2.7).  Meanwhile,  wage  workers  and  the  self-

employed  have  higher  levels  of  satisfaction 
than the unemployed.

Whether  the  self-employed  express  greater 
satisfaction than wage workers depends on the 
context.  In  industrial  countries  and  in  Eastern 
Europe and Central Asia, life satisfaction is, on 
average,  similar  among  both  groups,  but  in 
Latin America,  it  is  substantially  lower  among 
the self-employed.42

Jobs  contribute  to  how  people  view  them-
selves  and  relate  to  others.  Most  people  feel 
strongly  that  their  jobs  should  be  meaningful 
and contribute to society. A 2005 survey of 29 
countries asked people about the characteristics 
that  they  valued  in  their  jobs.43  Over  three- 
quarters reported that it is important to have a 
job that is useful to society, and a similar share 
agreed that it is important that their jobs help 
other people. In nine countries, the share who 
reported that it is important for jobs to be so-
cially useful was higher than the share reporting 
that  high  income  is  important. While  most  of 
these are high-income countries, preferences for

fer greatly in the Dominican Republic, Mexico, 
or South Africa.

Job satisfaction and other measures of non-
material well-being such as happiness or iden-
tity  may  be  affected  by  cultural  differences  

and social norms. Notwithstanding this, other 
health variables used as proxies of job satisfac-
tion  such  as  absence  of  fear  or  sadness  also 
show an association with working conditions. 
Research for Haiti, Jordan, and Vietnam finds 
working conditions such as basic hygiene and 
health,  workplace  facilities,  or  presence  of 
unions to be associated with fewer feelings of 
fear or sadness.44

Jobs  have  an  impact  on  the  well-being  of  the 
person who holds them, but they can also have 
an  impact  on  the  well-being  of  others.  Some 
jobs  bring  more  poverty  reduction  and,  as  
such,  benefit  those  who  consider  eradicating 
poverty  to  be  a  fundamental  societal  goal. 
Some  jobs  promote  higher  employment  rates 
among  women,  giving  more  say  on  the  way 
household  resources  are  allocated,  typically 
leading to greater spending on raising children. 
Gender equality, much the same as poverty re-
duction, is a broadly shared societal goal. Jobs 
that have these additional impacts do more for 
development. Given such spillover effects, jobs 
play  a  fundamental  role  in  the  well  being  of 
 individuals and entire societies. Jobs may thus 
be the center piece of a development strategy 
(Question 2).

QUeStION 2

Growth strategies or jobs strategies?

Rapid and sustained growth is generally viewed 
as  the  main  priority  for  developing  countries, 
and as a precondition for continued increases in 
living  standards  and  strengthened  social  cohe-
sion.  Economic  growth,  living  standards,  and 
social cohesion can indeed move together, and 
they  often  do—as  shown,  for  example,  by  the 
remarkable experience of East Asian economies, 
including  the  Republic  of  Korea  and  Singa-
pore.45  Building  on  the  East  Asian  experience, 
the conventional wisdom is to focus on growth 
and assume that increased living standards and 
greater  social  cohesion  will  follow.  This  is  the 
main tenet behind “growth strategies,” “growth 
diagnostics,” and “binding constraints analyses,” 
all of which aim to identify and remove obsta-
cles to economic growth and to sustain it over 
prolonged periods of time.

But transformations in living standards, pro-
ductivity, and social cohesion do not necessarily 
happen at the same pace. Lags and gaps in rising 
living standards can be illustrated by the differ-
ent  impacts  growth  has  on  poverty  reduction 
across countries. A 2 percent annual growth rate 
can reduce poverty rates by 1 percent in some 
countries and by 7 percent in others.46 Ethiopia, 
Tanzania,  and  Zambia  experienced  periods  of 
economic growth with very little change in pov-
erty incidence.47 On the other hand, important 
advances  in  poverty  reduction  have  also  hap-
pened  during  periods  of  slow  growth,  as  oc-
curred  in  Brazil  and  Mexico  during  the  1990s 
and  the  first  half  of  the  2000s.48 And  in  some 
cases, growth is not accompanied by increased 
social cohesion—even though poverty may fall 
and living standards improve for some, the ex-
pectations of others remain unfulfilled. Tunisia 
is a clear example in this regard: its growth rate 
is well above the average of the region, but it has 
nonetheless experienced serious social and po-
litical tensions.49

The  recognition  of  these  lags  and  gaps  has  
led  to  more  nuanced  approaches  to  economic 
growth  in  which  the  growth  being  sought  is 
“pro-poor,”  “shared,”  or  “inclusive.”50  In  these 
versions,  it  is  not  just  the  rate  of  growth  that 
matters  but  also  the  initial  distribution  of  in-

come  and  the  possibility  of  redistributing  re-
sources  through  the  growth  process  itself  and 
through government transfers.51

Behind these sensible qualifiers, it is possible 
to point to the role of jobs. Growth is “inclusive” 
when  higher  earnings  are  driven  by  employ-
ment opportunities for the majority of the labor 
force, particularly the poor. Recent studies show 
that the impact of economic growth on poverty 
reduction depends critically on the employment 
intensity  of  different  sectors.52  Employment 
 opportunities  also  matter  for  social  cohesion.  
It  is  thus  jobs  that  bring  together  the  three 
transformations.

Realizing the role jobs play implies going be-
yond the sequential view in which growth issues 
are  addressed  first  and  employment  follows 
from  increased  demand.  Instead,  jobs  are  seen  
as  a  medium  that  can  make  the  development 
transformations  a  reality.  From  a  sta tistical 
point of view, the relationship between growth 
and  employment  (or  unemployment)  shows 
substantial variation over time, across countries, 
and  across  sectors.  In  light  of  this  diversity,  a 
given rate of growth does not guarantee a given 
level of job creation or a given composition of 
employment (box 2.5).

When a growth strategy may not be 
sufficient

Focusing  on  the  aggregate  relationship  be-
tween  growth  and  employment  downplays 
some of the most important channels through 
which jobs connect to development. The very 
notion  of  employment  as  derived  labor  de-
mand does not reflect the situation of the many 
working  people  in  developing  countries  who 
are  farmers  and  self-employed.  The  focus  on 
the labor market as the transmission chain be-
tween  growth  and  employment  also  does  not 
capture the interaction of working people with 
others in households, at the workplace, and in 
society  more  broadly.  Focusing  solely  on  the 
relationship between growth and employment 
may fail to measure how jobs can foster gender 
equality,  support  urbanization,  or  contribute

BOX 2.5    The relationship between growth and employment is not mechanical

The statistical connection between economic growth and employ-
ment is sometimes termed Okun’s Law. In 1962 Arthur Okun found 
that  in  the  years  immediately  following  World  War  II,  a  1  percent 
increase  in  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  in  the  United  States 
brought about a 0.3 percent decline in unemployment. Since then, 
this empirical regularity has found support in a wide variety of coun-
tries. Recent research, however, suggests that Okun’s Law is not as 
stable as its name implies.a

The debate on the stability of Okun’s Law sheds light on the char-
acteristics  of  economic  recessions  and  expansions.  A  recent  study 
indicates  that,  in  industrial  countries,  unemployment  has  become 
more responsive to output declines over the past 20 years. This has 
been attributed to institutional reforms that have made labor mar-
kets more flexible. Interestingly, economies that suffer financial cri-
ses  and  large  housing  price  busts  (such  as  the  United  States  and 
Spain in recent years) have deeper and longer increases in unem-
ployment than Okun’s Law would have predicted; whereas econo-
mies with large short-time work schemes (like Germany, Italy, Japan, 
and the Netherlands) show less unemployment than predicted.b 

While Okun’s Law relates to unemployment, other studies focus 
on  the  growth  elasticity  of  employment.  In  its  simplest  form,  this 
elasticity  is  the  ratio  between  the  percentage  change  in  employ-

ment  and  the  percentage  change  in  GDP.  These  elasticities  show 
great variability over time and space, too, making it difficult to fore-
cast net job creation over the course of development. For instance, 
in Tanzania growth elasticities of employment declined from 1.04 in 
the  period  1992–96  to  0.27  in  the  period  2004–08.  Similar  trends 
have been reported for Ethiopia, Ghana, and Mozambique.c In Latin 
America, recent estimates show that growth elasticities of employ-
ment were much lower during the global financial crisis than in pre-
vious crises. In other words, the Great Recession produced compara-
tively less net employment destruction in that region.d 

While employment and unemployment are aggregates, growth 
may also affect the composition of unemployment. Important con-
troversies,  such  as  why  manufacturing  employment  in  India  has 
stagnated despite rapid growth in the sector can be interpreted in 
this light.e Other studies show that, given their different labor inten-
sities, economic growth in some sectors like agriculture, construc-
tion, or services generates more employment than does economic 
growth  in  manufacturing.f  Investment  projects  in  agribusiness  in 
Ukraine, in construction in India, and in tourism in Rwanda have had 
large employment impacts, not only because of the direct jobs cre-
ated but also because of indirect job creation in their large network 
of distribution channels.g

to peaceful collective decision making. Under-
standing  how  to  enhance  these  positive  spill-
overs  from  jobs  might  be  difficult  when  only 
aggregates are considered. 

The  case  of  urbanizing  economies  such  as 
Bangladesh may support the idea that the three 
major transformations happen simultaneously. 
Taking  advantage  of  their  abundance  of  rela-
tively  low-skilled  labor,  such  economies  can 
 engage  in  world  markets  through  light  manu-
facturing. Wage employment is created in large 
numbers, providing opportunities for rural mi-
grants, and cushioning social tensions at a time 
of  rapid  social  change.  In  Bangladesh,  the  ex-
pansion  of  the  light  manufacturing  sector  has 
allowed  for  the  integration  of  young  women 
into the labor market, at a time of falling fertility 
rates.  Employment  opportunities  for  women 
have  in  turn  led  to  growing  female  schooling, 
better  human  development  outcomes,  and 
faster poverty reduction.

In  practice,  however,  tradeoffs  between  the 
three transformations can amount to more than 
just lags and gaps. Depending on the nature of 
the  jobs  challenges  facing  a  country,  tensions 
may emerge between growth that generates jobs 
for  living  standards  and  growth  that  generates 
jobs for productivity growth or for social cohe-
sion. Examples abound:

•  In agrarian economies, increasing productiv-
ity in smallholder farming is fundamental for 
poverty reduction, given the share of the pop-
ulation living in rural areas. But urban jobs in 
activities that connect the economy to world 
markets and global value chains are necessary 
for growth. With limited resources to support 
both, a tradeoff between living standards and 
productivity may arise.

•  In  resource-rich  countries,  massive  invest-
ments in extractive industries support accel-

erated rates of growth and connections with 
international  markets  but  generate  little  di-
rect (or even indirect) employment and of-
ten  little  poverty  reduction.  Moreover,  the 
abundance of foreign exchange undermines 
the competitiveness of other activities, mak-
ing  it  difficult  to  create  productive  jobs  in 
other sectors.

•  In countries with high youth unemployment, 
job opportunities are not commensurate with 
the expectations created by the expansion of 
education systems. And the active labor mar-
ket programs needed to defuse social tensions 
in the short term may not do much for pov-
erty  reduction  because  many  of  the  jobless 
come from middle-class families, and devot-
ing public resources to finance them may re-
duce economic dynamism.

•  In  formalizing  economies,  there  is  an  effort  
to  support social  cohesion by extending  the 
coverage  of  social  protection  to  as  many 
workers  as  possible.  Broad  coverage  regard-
less of the type of job is often seen as part of a 
social compact. But extending coverage with-
out  distorting  incentives  to  work,  save,  and 
participate in formal systems is difficult and 
may  have  adverse  impacts  on  productivity 
and long-term growth.

When a jobs strategy may be appropriate 

Tradeoffs between improving living standards, 
accelerating productivity growth, and fostering 
social cohesion arguably reflect a measurement 
problem. While the contribution jobs make to 
output can be quantified, some of the spillovers 
from  jobs  cannot.  Measured  output  does  not 
increase when jobs defuse social tensions, even 
though  these  outcomes  are  valued  by  society 
and  may  increase  productivity  in  the  future. 
Conversely, measured output does not decline 
when jobs in export sectors are replaced by jobs 
producing  for  the  domestic  market,  even 
though  the  oppor tunities  to  acquire  technical 
and managerial knowledge through work tend 
to be higher in the export sectors.

If  the  spillovers  from  jobs  could  be  appro-
priately quantified, the tradeoffs would be fully 
understood and an adequate evaluation of the 
output  and  employment  potential  of  a  given 
growth strategy would be possible. For example, 

fully accounting for the negative impact of cur-
rent pollution on workers’ future health would 
make a more complete evaluation of the output 
potential of a growth strategy based on a given 
technology.  Opting  for  defused  tensions  or 
greater integration in world trade would lay the 
ground for accelerating growth in the future in a 
sustainable way, which a short-term evaluation 
based on output growth alone would fail to con-
sider. If measures of growth captured the intan-
gible social benefits from jobs, a growth strategy 
and a jobs strategy would be equivalent. How-
ever, when focusing on measured growth only, 
spillovers  from  jobs  can  easily  be  overlooked, 
and this is why a jobs strategy may be needed. By 
focusing on the spillovers from jobs, a jobs strat-
egy highlights the different outcomes of interest 
in a development process.

Considering  a  jobs  strategy  is  a  way  to  call 
attention to the social value of jobs. A jobs strat-
egy assesses the types of jobs that do more for 
development in a particular country context. It 
relies on qualitative and quantitative analyses to 
identify how jobs contribute to living standards, 
productivity, and social cohesion. And it seeks to 
identify where the constraints to the creation of 
the  jobs  with  the  highest  development  payoff  
lie in practice. In some cases, a jobs strategy will  
focus on increasing female labor participation, 
in  others  on  creating  employment  opportuni-
ties for youth, yet in others on creating a sup-
portive environment for the creation of jobs in 
cities, or jobs connected to global value chains. 
This  may  not  be  too  different  from  preparing  
a  more  comprehensive  growth  strategy,  except 
that jobs would be center stage.

Jobs strategies are not needed under all cir-
cumstances.  A  jobs  strategy  is  warranted  only 
when  potentially  important  spillovers  from  
jobs  are  not  realized,  leading  to  tensions  be-
tween living standards, productivity, and social 
cohesion.  When  improvements  in  living  stan-
dards, productivity, and social cohesion happen 
together,  as  was  the  case  in  several  East  Asian 
countries, and may now be the case in urbaniz-
ing  economies  such  as  Bangladesh,  a  growth 
strategy may be more appropriate. Yet even re-
markably successful East Asian economies such 
as Korea and Singapore, which undoubtedly de-
livered inclusive growth over many decades, also 
had jobs strategies at specific points in their de-
velopment histories (box 2.6).

BOX 2.6    Korea went from a growth to a jobs strategy, and Singapore the other way around

The Republic of Korea and Singapore are success stories combining 
long-term  economic  growth  with  rapid  poverty  reduction  and 
strong social cohesion. But at different points in time, both coun-
tries relied on jobs strategies.

Singapore was confronted with a tense social situation at inde-
pendence, with both high unemployment and inter-ethnic tension. 
Its first development strategy focused on jobs, housing, and wage 
moderation.  As  unemployment  subsided,  the  next  strategy  was 
geared toward raising labor costs to encourage higher-value-added 
activities. This cost drive resulted in a recession, however, and since 
then Singapore has focused on growth, rather than jobs.

Conversely,  Korea  abandoned  development  planning  in  1996, 
but  in  2010,  it  adopted  a  jobs  strategy  for  the  next  decade  as  its  
highest-level policy document. In October 2010, the Korean govern-
ment launched the “National Employment Strategy 2020 for the Bal-
ance of Growth, Employment and Welfare.” In the tradition of long-
range  plans,  this  national  strategy  has  a  clear  target  for  2020:  an 
increase  in  the  employment  rate  of  the  working-age  population  
(15–64  years)  to  a  minimum  of  70  percent—the  average  among 
industrial  economies.  The  strategy  was  rooted  in  the  mismatch 
between  macroeconomic  indicators  that  pointed  to  a  recovering 
economy and the inability of individuals—especially youth—to find 
adequate employment. 

The strategy identifies four pillars to achieve the 70 percent tar-
get. The first recognizes the importance of collaboration between 
the public and private sectors for employment creation and consists 
of implementing economic and industrial policies in a job-friendly 
manner. The second aims at improving flexibility and fairness in the 
workplace and consists of a series of reforms to increase regulation 
in certain areas of the labor law, while decreasing regulation in oth-
ers. Thus the 40-hour workweek became enforceable for all compa-
nies, regardless of size,a with the obligatory introduction of the work 
time savings system.b Simultaneously, regulations on duration of con-
tracts for temporary workers and fixed-term contracts were relaxed 
to allow for more hiring flexibility. The third pillar focuses on increas-
ing labor force participation and skill development of women, youth, 
and older workers. This involves developing the option of perma-
nent part-time jobs, thus allowing parents to both work and care for 
their  children,  especially  in  sectors  suffering  from  labor  shortages 
and  unable  to  fill  full-time  jobs.  Older  workers  would  be  retained 
longer in the active labor force by having the option to work shorter 
hours under the wage peak system.c Last but not least, the inten-
tion is to facilitate welfare-to-work transitions, by encouraging able- 
bodied welfare recipients to enroll in employment assistance pro-
grams and by reinforcing their obligation to pursue employment.

Jobs and productivity

Reallocation from low- to high-productivity jobs matters more for growth in 
developing countries, where differences in productivity across sectors and within 
sectors are wide. But reallocation often amounts to little more than churning.

Productivity  growth  happens  as  jobs  be-

come  more  productive,  as  new  high- 
productivity jobs are created, and as low- 
productivity  jobs  disappear.  In  the  medium 
term,  trends  in  employment  align  closely  with 
trends in the labor force, so there is no such a 
thing as jobless growth. But the short-term rela-
tionship  between  employment  and  growth  is 
more complex. Large numbers of jobs are being 
created  and  destroyed  simultaneously,  leading 
to structural change and spatial labor realloca-
tion.  Underneath  these  sectoral  and  spatial 
changes are firm dynamics that result in a con-
stant restructuring and reallocation of resources, 
including labor. 

In  developing  countries,  many  people  work 
in  very  small  and  not  so  dynamic  economic 
units.  Family  farms,  which  often  predominate 
in agriculture, average only 1.2 hectares in Asia, 
and 1.8 hectares in Sub-Saharan Africa. Outside 
of  agriculture,  microenterprises  and  household 
businesses account for a large share of employ-
ment  in  a  majority  of  developing  countries. 
These businesses make a significant contribution 
to gross job creation and destruction, although 
not necessarily to net job creation and produc-
tivity growth. 

In  agriculture,  the  Green  Revolution  has 
led  to  higher  cereal  yields  and  to  employment 
growth because the new technologies are labor 
intensive. The progress has been uneven across 

regions,  however.  In  Sub-Saharan  Africa,  the 
Green Revolution has not taken place on a large 
scale.

Outside  of  agriculture,  productivity  varies 
substantially  across  enterprises,  implying  po-
tentially large productivity gains from job real-
location. The speed at which productivity grows 
also  varies.  Large  firms  are  more  innovative, 
provided that they are exposed to competition. 
At the other end, microenterprises are a diverse 
group. A vast majority of them, more prone to 
churning than to growth, are a means of survival 
for the poor. Yet some are entrepreneurial, and 
their success could boost wage employment.

Employment turbulence,  
not jobless growth

Jobless  growth  is  a  popular  notion,  often  be-
lieved to be grounded on data. However, unem-
ployment rates neither explode nor vanish over 
time,  so  employment  trends  align  closely  with 
trends in the size of the labor force. The growth 
of gross domestic product (GDP) certainly mat-
ters for employment growth, but in the medium 
term it matters less than demographics and par-
ticipation rates. Data from 97 countries over the 
past decade confirm that a positive relationship 
exists between the growth of GDP per capita and 
the  growth  of  employment  per  capita  (figure

BOX 3.1    What drives economic growth?

At the risk of simplifying, four main forces lie behind increases in an 
economy’s per capita output. The first is the use of more capital per 
unit  of  labor.  The  second  is  an  increase  in  the  number  of  people 
working, relative to the total population. This happens when fertility 
declines and the share of adults in the total population increases;  
it  is  also  happens  when  women  shift  their  work  from  household 
chores  to  income-generating  activities.  The  third  mechanism 
through  which  output  can  grow  is  by  making  people  themselves 
more  productive.  The  acquisition  of  skills,  also  known  as  human 
capital accumulation, allows a person to do more using the same 
amount of capital. The fourth mechanism is technological progress, 

measured  as  changes  in  total  factor  productivity.  Technological 
progress amounts to combining capital, labor, and skills more effi-
ciently, while applying new knowledge. 

Growth  decomposition  quantifies  the  contribution  of  each  of 
these four forces to economic growth. It can be done for any partic-
ular country given sufficient data on gross domestic product, capi-
tal, employment, and human capital. Some of these variables may 
need to be constructed or approximated; for instance, the stock of 
capital in an economy is estimated based on accumulated invest-
ments,  while  human  capital  is  approximated  by  the  educational 
attainment of its population, corrected for the quality of education.

3.1a).1 The relationship is not very strong, but 
only in very  few cases was growth truly jobless. 
On the other hand, the short-term relation-
ship  between  growth  and  employment  is  not 
so  straightforward.  Growth  happens  partly 
through the disappearance of low-productivity 
jobs  as  well  as  through  the  creation  of  more 
productive  jobs.2  So  for  the  same  sample  of 
countries over the same decade, surges in total 
factor productivity (TFP) in one year were in-

deed associated with a decline in employment in 
the same year (figure 3.1b). Only in subsequent 
years did this negative employment effect wane.
Productivity  growth  is  a  turbulent  pro-
cess.  Analyses  covering  economies  as  different 
as  Ethiopia  and  the  United  States  in  different 
periods  over  the  past  three  decades  reveal  the 
magnitude of  gross job  creation and gross  job 
destruction  (figure  3.2).  In  the  manufacturing 
sector  of  developing  countries,  between  7  and

Scarpetta 2009b and Shiferaw and Bedi 2010.
Note: The figure shows annual job flows. Data are from Argentina (1996–2001); Brazil (1997–2000);  
Canada (1984–97); Chile (1980–98); Colombia (1983–97); Estonia (1996–2000); Ethiopia (1997–2007);  
Finland (1989–97); France (1989–97); Germany (1977–99); Hungary (1993–2000); Indonesia (1991–94); Italy 
(1987–94); Latvia (1983–98); Mexico (1986–2000); the Netherlands (1993–95);  Portugal (1983–98); Romania 
(1993–2000); Slovenia (1991–2000); Taiwan, China (1986–91); the United Kingdom (1982–98); the United 
States (1986–91, 1994–96); and República Bolivariana de Venezuela (1996–98).

20 percent of jobs are created every year, while 
a  similar  proportion  disappear.3  Even  when  
aggregate  employment  was  declining,  as  in 
the 1990s in Romania and Slovenia and in the  
manufacturing sector of República Bolivariana 
de  Venezuela,  many  new  jobs  were  being  cre-
ated.  Conversely,  when  aggregate  employment 
was growing by 6 percent in Mexico, jobs were 
disappearing at almost twice that rate. 

Job  flows  may  be  associated  with  profound 
transformations in the sectoral structure of the 
economy. Technological change often occurs for 
specific  products  and  processes,  causing  pro-
ductivity to grow at different paces in different 
sectors. However, the relative weight of different 
sectors in the economy is determined not only 
by  technological  progress,  but  also  by  market 
demand  and  nonmarket  forces.  When  there  is 
an expansion of the most productive sectors, ag-
gregate productivity increases. This composition 
effect,  called  productivity-enhancing  structural 
change, is well documented in the case of labor 
shifts from agriculture to industry and services. 
Analysis based on more disaggregated data sug-
gests that reallocation of labor across sectors has 
also  been  an  important  driver  of  productivity 
growth in several fast-growing East Asian coun-
tries.  In  China,  it  contributed  4.1  percentage 
points of the 7.3 percent annual growth in ag-
gregate labor productivity over the past decade; 
in Vietnam, it accounted for 2.6 points out of 4.2 
(figure 3.3).4 

Job  flows  are  also  associated  with  changes 
in  the  spatial  distribution  of  employment.  
The  structural  shift  from  agriculture  in  rural 
areas  to  industry  and  services  in  towns  and  
cities may be the most visible example of spa-
tial  labor  reallocation,  but  it  is  not  the  only 
one.5 Even within sectors, job flows often have 
a strong spatial dimension. New plants associ-
ated with more innovative activities tend to start  
in  large,  diversified  cities—incubators—with 
a  higher  density  of  suppliers  and  labor,  and 
more fluent exchanges of information. As they 
mature and become more self-sufficient in in-
formation,  these  plants  move  to  smaller  cities, 
where land and wage costs are lower. As a result, 
many medium and small cities tend to be more 
specialized.6

The extent of spatial relocation varies across 
sectors  and  countries.  For  instance,  in  the  Re-
public  of  Korea,  manufacturing  dominance  in

reallocation across sectors

Source: World Development Report 2013 team estimates based on Kucera and Roncolato 2012.
Note: The figure shows the decomposition of labor productivity growth in 81 economies over 1999–2008 into productivity changes due to changes within sectors and reallocation 
across sectors. Seven sectors are considered: agriculture, hunting, forestry, and fishing; mining and utilities; manufacturing; construction; trade, restaurants, and hotels; transport, 
storage, and communication; and other services. The regional growth rates are weighted averages, with weights based on an economy’s share in regional GDP.

urban centers has continued for a long period 
of  time.  Enterprises  have  been  sprawling  into 
the suburbs of urban centers rather than leap-
frogging  to  different  locations  as  in  some  in-
dustrial countries (map 3.1). Similar shifts are 
happening  in  Brazil,  China,  and  Vietnam.7  In 
India, large manufacturing enterprises are mov-
ing  away  from  urban  centers  into  rural  loca-
tions.8 Regardless of the nature of the shift, al-
most inevitably jobs are created in some places 
and destroyed in others.

Underneath these sectoral and spatial changes 
in  the  structure  of  employment  are  the  firm 
dynamics  connecting  job  flows  and  productiv-
ity growth. Aggregate productivity grows when 
existing  firms  become  better  at  what  they  do, 
when more productive firms enter the market, 
and when less productive ones exit. It also grows 
when more productive firms become bigger and 
less productive ones become smaller. Decompo-
sition analyses show that in most countries the 

main driver of aggregate productivity growth is 
firms  becoming  better  at  what  they  do  (figure 
3.4).9 Entry and exit also contribute, which in-
dicates that new firms are more productive than 
those exiting. In general, exiting firms see their 
productivity  decline  before  they  close,  whereas 
new  firms  tend  to  attain  the  average  levels  of 
productivity of their industry within five years. 
These complex dynamics imply that at any point 
in  time,  firms  with  very  different  productiv-
ity levels coexist, even within narrowly defined 
industries.10

The  popular  perception  that  productivity 
grows  through  downsizing  at  the  firm  level  is 
partially  supported  by  these  analyses.  Indeed, 
in  many  cases,  employment  tends  to  shrink  in 
firms experiencing rapid productivity growth.11 
But downsizing is only part of the story. There 
are also many successful upsizing firms, achiev-
ing both productivity growth and employment 
growth.12 For instance, one-fourth of manufac-

Note: no. = number. The figure shows the contribution of each of the four groups to the annual growth rate of the variable of interest. The plants considered employ at least 
10 workers and exist throughout the entire period. Successful upsizers are plants that increased both labor productivity and employment, successful downsizers are plants that in-
creased productivity but reduced employment, unsuccessful downsizers are plants that reduced employment and productivity, and unsuccessful upsizers are plants that increased 
employment but reduced productivity.

turing  plants  operating  in  Chile  over  2001–06 
were  successful  downsizers,  consistent  with  the 
popular  perception.  But  another  one-fourth 
were  successful  upsizers,  achieving  both  pro-
ductivity  and  employment  growth  (figure  3.5). 
More  important,  the  successful  upsizers  con-
tributed more to production, employment, and 
aggregate productivity growth than the success-
ful downsizers. Results were similar in Romania 
between 2000 and 2005, and in Ethiopia between 
2005 and 2009. While country experiences vary, 
having a critical mass of successful upsizers is not 
uncommon. 

Across countries, successful upsizers in man-
ufacturing industries tend to be younger, leaner, 
and  more  innovative.  Among  survivors  in  the 
same  industry  and  region,  younger  firms  were 
more likely to be upsizers in Chile over 2001–06, 
and successful upsizers in Romania over 2000–
05.  In  all  three  countries,  survivors  employing 
fewer than 20 employees tended to upsize fewer 
rather than downsize. In Romania, survivors in-
vesting more in capital per worker also tended to 

be  successful  upsizers.13  Recent  evidence  based 
on 26,000 manufacturers from 71 countries fur-
ther shows that firms that innovated in products 
or processes were more likely to be successful up-
sizers; they not only attained higher total factor 
productivity than noninnovative firms; they also 
exhibited higher employment growth.14

Transition  economies  in  Europe  illustrate 
the  links  between  job  reallocation  and  pro-
ductivity  growth.  Before  reforms  were  imple-
mented,  these  economies  suffered  from  large 
distortions caused by a rigid planning system, 
which  prevented  resources  from  flowing  to 
more efficient uses. Liberalization led to mas-
sive downsizing and job losses. Eventually, it also 
strengthened incentives, mobility, and markets, 
opening up space for more productive private 
companies. The entry of these dynamic players 
contributed between 20 and 50 percent of total  
labor productivity growth in the late 1990s. The 
exit  of  obsolete  firms  released  resources  that 
could be used more effectively by new or exist-
ing firms. Although lack of experience and small 

104 

  WO R L D   D E V E LO P M E N T   R E P O RT   2 0 1 3

size  often  made  the  new  firms  less  productive 
than the average firms of more advanced coun-
tries, these new firms were more efficient than 
domestic incumbents. They played a strong role 
in boosting productivity in medium- and high-
technology industries and in exerting competi-
tive pressure on existing firms.15

China’s  rapid  productivity  growth  was 
also  underpinned  by  large-scale  reallocation. 
Beginning  in  1978,  economic  reform  efforts 
gradually  expanded  the  influence  of  markets 
and  deepened  global  integration.  All  of  this 
created  unprecedented  opportunities  for  the 
formation of private entities, including town-
ship  and  village  enterprises,  and  the  entry  of 
foreign companies. During the first decade of 
reform  (1978–88),  reallocation  from  agricul-
ture to nonagriculture activities was the source 
of almost half of all productivity growth. In the 
following  decades,  however,  the  main  drivers 
of productivity growth were labor reallocation 
out of the state sector, private sector vibrancy, 
and  state  sector  restructuring.  The  scale  of 
business  entry  was  startling:  the  number  of 
industrial firms rose from 377,000 in 1980 to 
nearly  8  million  in  1996.  The  2004  economic

census  reported  1.33  million  manufacturing 
firms with annual sales above RMB 5 million.16 
Most of them were private. The entry of these 
new  businesses  and  the  closure  of  nonviable 
state-owned enterprises (SOEs) accounted for 
two-thirds  of  TFP  growth  in  manufacturing 
sectors over 1998–2006.17 

Most jobs are in very small farms 
and firms

Many  people  in  developing  countries  work 
in  very  small  and  not  very  dynamic  economic 
units—family 
farms,  microenterprises,  and 
household  businesses.  Although  microenter-
prises are often defined as firms employing ten 
or fewer workers, many among them are actu-
ally one-person businesses. Given their contri-
bution  to  total  employment,  these  small  eco-
nomic units cannot be ignored. Understanding 
their dynamics is crucial to deciphering the rela-
tionship between jobs and productivity. 

In  family  farms,  hired  labor  is  usually  em-
ployed in simple tasks such as weeding and har-
vesting, whereas family labor usually carries out 
care-intensive activities such as water manage-
ment,  land  preparation,  and  fertilizer  applica-
tion.  Limited  reliance  on  hired  labor  is  due  to 
the  difficulty  to  monitor  effort,  and  without 
machinery,  farms  cannot  be  expanded  beyond 
the size manageable by the family’s labor, which 
is typically 1 to 2 hectares.18 Family farms domi-
nate even in high-income countries, and owner 
cultivation  is  the  most  common  form  of  land 
tenure, especially in Asia (figure 3.6).

At 1.2 and 1.8 hectares, respectively, average 
farm size is small in both Asia and Sub-Saharan 
Africa.19  In  Asia,  farmers  typically  own  land 
plots,  which  they  supplement  through  tenancy 
contracts that facilitate transfers from relatively 
land-abundant  to  relatively  labor-abundant 
households.  Farms  in  Sub-Saharan  Africa  are 
slightly larger than in Asia, but size and the im-
portance of owner farming are becoming similar 
in both regions.20 There are some exceptions to 
this pattern. Colonial governments created large 
farms in some developing countries, such as es-
tates  in  southern  Africa,  haciendas  in  Latin 
America and the Philippines, and plantations in 
the Caribbean. In Sub-Saharan Africa, large ar-
eas are also held as customary land—owned col-
lectively by extended families, clans, or lineage.21

dor, and Mexico have fewer than 10 workers.22 
About 90 percent of manufacturing establish-
ments employ 5 to 49 workers in China; India; 
Indonesia; Korea; the Philippines; and Taiwan, 
China.23 The share of microenterprises is even 
higher  outside  manufacturing,  reaching  94 
percent in the services sector of Mexico and 98 
percent  in  all  modern  sectors  in  Tunisia.24  In 
several African and Latin American countries, 
the majority of informal enterprises consist of 
1- to 3-person businesses.25

It is often claimed that most employment, and 
most  job  creation,  is  associated  with  small  and 
medium enterprises, but that is generally not true 
in  developing  countries.  In  reality,  micro-  and 
small enterprises account for the bulk of employ-
ment,  even  in  middle-income  countries  (figure 
3.7). Their share is often underestimated, because 
economic censuses and plant-level surveys rarely 
cover  the  informal  segment  of  the  economy, 
where  businesses  are  especially  small.  But  data 
from household and labor force surveys that are 
representative  of  the  entire  population  provide 
a  different  picture.  These  small  enterprises  play 
significant  role  in  employment  in  manufactur-
ing. They account for 97 percent of employment

BOX 3.2    Microenterprises account for most job creation and destruction

In some household and labor force surveys, employees are asked to 
report the size of the firm they work for, or the size of their own busi-
ness if they are self-employed. This information can be used to esti-
mate the distribution of employment by plant size. This distribution 
can in turn be used to correct for the omission of informal enter-
prises in an economic census or plant-level survey. 

This approach was applied to Chile’s manufacturing survey, the 
Annual  National  Industrial  Survey  (Encuesta  Nacional  Industrial 
Anual), which covers more than 90 percent of employment among 
establishments  with  50  workers  or  more,  but  less  than  half  the 
employment  in  establishments  with  10  to  49  workers.  Nearly 
300,000 workers in microenterprises are omitted from the survey; 
250,000 of them work in firms with fewer than 5 employees. 

The  distribution  of  job  flows  by  firm  size  that  emerges  from  
the  manufacturing  survey  can  be  adjusted  based  on  the  distri- 
bution of employment by plant size from Chile’s household survey,  
the  National Socio economic Characterization Survey (Encuesta de 
Caracterización  Socioeconómica  Nacional,  or  CASEN).  Before  this 
adjustment, larger firms seem to account for most job creation and 
destruction. But the adjustment shows that microenterprises con-
tribute about 80 percent of gross job flows. This estimate should not 
be taken literally, because the microenterprises for which informa-
tion on job creation and destruction is available are not necessarily 
representative—the Chilean census started to include microenter-
prises only in the late 1990s. But even with a margin of error, the 
estimate is so large that it changes the picture of job creation and 
job destruction.

in the manufacturing sector in Ethiopia and 39 
percent in Chile. In services sectors, their role is 
often more important. Even in Eastern European 
countries, where private sector entry is only two 
decades old, microenterprises account for 10 to 
20 percent of employment in manufacturing and 
for 30 to 50 percent of employment in services. 
Micro- and small enterprises also play a critical 
role in job creation and destruction (box 3.2).26

In farms, uneven technological 
progress

It is generally assumed that large farms are more  
productive. In low-income countries, however, 

yields per hectare tend to be higher in smaller 
farms, because family farms apply more labor 
per unit of land, even though they apply fewer 
purchased inputs. This inverse relationship be-
tween farm size and productivity was first ob-
served in South Asia.27 But it has also emerged 
in  Sub-Saharan Africa  as  population  pressure 
on the land has led to agricultural intensifica-
tion. In Kenya, Malawi, Tanzania, and Uganda, 
a 1 percent increase in farm size is associated 
with a 0.1 to 0.2 percent reduction in yield.28 
The use of family labor per hectare is also in-
versely correlated with farm size.29 

The  relationship  between  crop  yields  and 
farm  size  emerges,  because  the  larger,  more 
mechanized farms have higher productivity. But

constraints in land markets usually slow expan-
sion and mechanization.30

The new technologies of the Green Revolu-
tion  contributed  to  job  creation  because  they 
were labor intensive. Short-statured, fertilizer-
responsive,  high-yielding  varieties  of  rice  and 
wheat  were  developed  by  international  agri-
cultural research centers in the late 1960s. The 
varietal  improvement  of  other  cereals  such  as 
maize followed. These varieties, as well as im-
proved production practices, were quickly dif-
fused, particularly in tropical Asia. The amount 
of  inorganic  fertilizer  applied  has  steadily  in-
creased  over  extended  periods.31  Thanks  to 
continual  technological 
improvements  and 
sustained adoption, cereal yields have increased 
dramatically for the past several decades.32 

Progress  has  been  uneven  across  regions, 
however  (figure  3.8).  In  Sub-Saharan  Africa, 
there is no evidence to suggest that small farm-
ers were slower than larger farmers in adopting 
the new technologies. But the Green Revolution 
has not taken place on a large scale, even though 
farmland  has  been  growing  scarce  because  
of  population  pressure  on  limited   cultivable 
areas.33  Feeding  growing  populations  from  a 
shrinking amount of farm land requires Sub-
Saharan  African  countries  to  increase  cereal 
yields.34 Yet improved agricultural technology 
is location specific: improved varieties in Asia 

may not be productive in Sub-Saharan Africa, 
and  high-yielding  varieties  in  irrigated  areas 
may be low-yielding in rain-fed areas.35

The  agricultural  growth  associated  with 
the Green Revolution not only creates jobs in 
farming but also facilitates the development of 
the nonfarm sectors.36 The adoption of mod-
ern technology stimulates the production and 
marketing  of  fertilizer  and  other  purchased 
inputs.  Increased  supply  of  cereals  stimulates 
the  development  of  food  markets  and  keeps 
the cost of living low for those who migrate to 
the  cities.  In  addition  to  these  backward  and 
forward links, the increase in farmers’ incomes 
heightens the demand for goods and services.37 
Cross-country analyses show that agricultural 
growth has resulted in the expansion of non-
farm  sectors,  particularly  where  the  agricul-
tural sector is large.38

Among firms, much churning and 
few gazelles

Outside of agriculture, productivity varies sub-
stantially  across  enterprises,  implying  that  job 
reallocation could lead to large gains in aggre-
gate  productivity.  In  India,  within  a  narrowly 
defined manufacturing industry, a plant at the 
90th  percentile  of  the  TFP  distribution  gener-

Note: TFP = total factor productivity. The figure shows the ratio of TFP among plants between the 90th and the 10th percentiles of the TFP distribution within narrowly defined 
industries. TFP is measured as physical productivity, as defined by Foster, Haltiwanger, and Syverson (2008). The data cover only the manufacturing sector. Data are from Argentina 
(2002), Bolivia (2001), Chile (2006), China (2005),  Ecuador (2005), El Salvador (2005),  India (1994), Mexico (2004), United States (1997), and Uruguay (2005).

ates 22 times as much output as a plant at the 
10th  percentile.  In  comparison,  the  estimated 
ratio  is  only  9  to  1  in  the  United  States.39  The 
dispersion of TFP is also high in a number of 
Latin American countries (figure 3.9). Detailed 
data  on  nonmanufacturing  firms  are  scarcer. 
But the dispersion of TFP in retail businesses in 
Mexico, and in communication and transporta-
tion businesses in Uruguay, is also sizable.40

The speed at which productivity grows also 
varies  across  firms.  Large  firms  are  typically 
more innovative than small firms. They tend to 
invest  more  in  machinery  and  hire  more  edu-
cated  workers.  They  are  also  more  likely  than 
small firms to engage in activities such as devel-
oping new product lines, introducing new tech-
nology,  opening  and  closing  plants,  outsourc-
ing, and engaging in joint ventures with foreign 
partners  (figure  3.10a).  Large  firms  produce 
more  with  a  given  amount  of  labor,  are  more 
likely to export, and tend to export more. They 
also pay substantively higher wages than micro- 
and small enterprises (figure 3.10b). They pay a 
wage premium even controlling for age, educa-
tion,  and  other  worker  characteristics.  Not  all 
large firms are innovative, however. When size 
is  supported  through  nonmarket  mechanisms, 

efficiency  tends  to  suffer.  Large  SOEs  without 
foreign competitors are less innovative and pro-
ductive than other large firms.41

For a given size, young firms are also more 
likely than old firms to engage in innovative ac-
tivities. They also have better growth prospects, 
a finding consistent with evidence from indus-
trial  countries  (figure  3.11).42  For  example,  in 
the  1990s,  when  China  was  in  the  early  stages 
of reform, human and financial resources were 
concentrated  in  SOEs.  However,  the  incentive 
structure in these enterprises hindered innova-
tion. In contrast, the new township and village 
enterprises  lacked  the  resources  to  adopt  new 
technology  and  import  new  equipment,  but 
they were more flexible in their decision mak-
ing. As a result, these younger firms were more 
dynamic  than  large  SOEs,  although  they  were 
less productive than large and medium private 
companies.43 

In  developing  countries,  the  dispersion  of 
productivity and growth prospects across firms 
is  further  widened  by  the  large  number  of 
micro enterprises,  many  of  which  are  barely 
more than a means of subsistence for the poor. 
A majority of these microenterprises have lim-
ited capital and often even lack a fixed address.

BOX 3.3    Most microenterprises are in rural areas and engage in commerce

Microenterprises in urban areas, and particularly those in the infor-
mal  sector,  tend  to  attract  the  attention  of  academics  and  policy 
makers.  But  microenterprises  are  prominent  in  rural  areas  as  well. 
The  surveys  of  micro-  and  small  enterprises  in  Africa  and  in  Latin 
America and the Caribbean show that fewer than half are in cities 
and towns with 20,000 inhabitants or more. The urban share reaches 
46 percent in the Dominican Republic but is below 30 percent in all 
other countries surveyed. Even if rural towns are counted (generally, 
localities  with  2,000  to  20,000  inhabitants),  well  over  half  of  the 
enterprises are in strictly rural areas in most countries.

The vast majority of microenterprises are engaged in commerce, 
supporting the conventional view that associates microenterprises 
with street vendors and petty traders. But a significant number are 
involved  in  light  manufacturing  activities.  According  to  the  1-2-3 
surveys of West African countries, the most important sector in capi-
tal cities is petty trading (27.1 percent of all enterprises), followed by 

other manufacturing and food (16 percent) and other services (11.8 
percent).  Similarly,  the  surveys  of  countries  in  Africa  and  in  Latin 
America and the Caribbean suggest that 56 to 74 percent of micro- 
and small firms in urban areas, and 60 to 70 percent in rural areas, 
are engaged in commerce. The surveys of household enterprises in 
Sub-Saharan African countries show similar patterns. These surveys 
identify three manufacturing activities as the most important across 
all countries: textiles and apparel, food and beverages, and wood 
and  forest  products.  These  three  categories  account  for  about  75 
percent of manufacturing enterprises in urban areas and nearly 90 
percent of manufacturing enterprises in rural areas.

Most  of  the  microenterprises  operate  from  home  or  on  the 
street.  According  to  the  surveys  of  household  enterprises  in  Sub-
Saharan Africa, 25 to 45 percent of these microfirms use home as 
primary  point  of  operation,  and  10  to  40  percent  of  them  simply 
work on the street.

Sources: Fox and Sohnesen 2012; Grimm, Kruger, and Lay 2011; Liedholm 2002. 

Many are  located in rural areas, absorbing some 
labor  slack  during  the  low  agricultural  season 
(box  3.3).  Across  18  developing  countries,  44 
percent of the people living on less than US$1 a 
day in urban areas, and 24 percent of those in 
rural areas, work in a nonagricultural business. 
On average, they do not earn much.44

Nonetheless,  these  nonfarm  activities  pro-
vide an important channel to diversify income 
for the poor. In nine Sub-Saharan African coun-
tries,  most  nonfarm  jobs  were  generated  by 
households starting businesses, rather than en-
tering the rapidly expanding private wage sector. 
Despite being modest, earnings from household 
enterprises  contribute  to  consumption  much 
the  same  as  earnings  from  wage  employment 
do. And these small businesses offer an avenue 
for  poor  households  to  engage  in  gradually 
more productive activities.45

While microenterprises have a lackluster per-
formance as a group, they are also very diverse. 
In middle-income countries, a significant share 
of  the  owners  of  micro-  and  small  enterprises 
are  as  entrepreneurial  as  their  peers  in  indus-
trial  countries.  Their  weak  performance  may 
be  driven  more  by  contextual  factors  such  as 
limited access to credit and policy-induced bar-
riers  to  access  technologies  and  markets,  than 
by  limited  capacity.  In  several  Latin  Ameri-
can  countries,  for  example,  entrants  into  self- 
employment  tend  to  be  workers  who  have  ac-

cumulated  human  and  physical  capital  while 
working  for  a  wage  or  a  salary.  Operating 
micro  enterprises  is  a  choice  for  them.  Those 
who achieve higher productivity levels are more 
likely  to  stay  in  business,  grow,  and  create  job 
opportunities for others.46 

A very small group of microenterprises actu-
ally displays a strong performance. This group 
bears similarities with the so-called “gazelles” of 
industrial  countries—high-growth  companies 
whose revenues increase by at least 20 percent 
annually  for  four  years  or  more.  In  industrial 
countries,  the  term “gazelle”  is  used  for  com-
panies starting from a revenue base of at least  
US$1  million,  which  makes  them  very  big  
by developing-country standards. Nonetheless, 
the  same  dynamism  can  be  found  at  a  much 
smaller  scale.  Data  from  seven  Sub-Saharan 
African countries show that the median capital 
stock held by urban informal enterprises is less 
than US$80, whereas the capital stock for those 
in the top quintile averages US$5,000. The aver-
age monthly profit of those in the top quintile 
is seven times the median monthly profit. The 
rate of returns to capital is also relatively high in 
these firms.47 This heterogeneity among micro-
enterprises  suggests  they  can  be  an  incubator 
for large and productive firms.

The  dynamism  of  microenterprises  matters 
not only for livelihoods but also for productivity 
growth. Large firms innovate more, but they are

not all born large. In industrial countries, some 
of the more resounding successes, from Honda 
to Microsoft, started in garages. And many suc-
cessful companies in developing countries also 
grew out of small household businesses. Thai-
land’s  Charoen  Pokphand  Group,  founded  in 
1921  as  a  small  seed  shop  in  Bangkok  by  two 
brothers, has grown into one of the world’s larg-
est multinational conglomerates in agribusiness, 
operating  in  15  countries  and  encompassing 
close  to  100  companies.48  India’s  Tata  Group 
transformed  from  a  Mumbai-based,  family-
owned trading firm in the late 19th century to 

a  multinational  conglomerate  comprising  114 
companies  and  subsidiaries  across  8  business 
sectors on several continents.49 Many of China’s 
successful  clusters,  such  as  the  footwear  and 
electric  appliance  industry  in  Wenzhou,  also 
started  from  small  family  businesses  working 
close to each other.50

A  vibrant  firm  life  cycle  is  often  missing, 
however.  Larger  and  older  firms  tend  to  be 
stagnant, while smaller enterprises are prone to 
churning.  In  Ghana,  for  example,  many  firms 
are  born  large  and  show  little  growth  over  15 
years  (figure  3.12).  In  Portugal,  by  contrast,

many more firms are born as microenterprises 
and grow substantially in 7 years.51 The major-
ity of firms are born small in India too, but they 
tend  to  stay  small,  without  displaying  much 
variation  in  employment  over  their  life  cycle. 
A revealing comparison involves the size of 35-
year  old  firms  relative  to  their  size  at  birth.  In 
India, the size declines by a fourth. In Mexico, it 
doubles. In the United States, it is 10 times larger 
(figure 3.13a). Productivity growth over a firm’s 
life cycle follows similar patterns in these coun-
tries (figure 3.13b).52

Churning—entering  and  exiting  at  a  rela-
tively high rate—is much more common than 
growth among the micro- and small enterprises 
of developing countries. In several Sub-Saharan 
African and Latin American countries, about 20 
percent  of  micro-  and  small  enterprises  enter 
and leave the market in the same year. A majority 
of closures occur within three years of starting 
up. Among the survivors, less than 3 percent ex-
pand by four employees or more.53 In Vietnam, 

20 to 30 percent of household enterprises leave 
the  market  over  a  two-year  period,  while  the 
total number of household enterprises remains 
about  the  same.54  In  Sub-Saharan  Africa,  few 
household enterprises expand into employment 
beyond the household, as shown by the experi-
ences of Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Madagascar.55 
In Mexico, individuals starting microenterprises 
are more likely to remain the sole worker than to 
increase the firm size (table 3.1).56 

The  wide  dispersion  of  productivity  among 
businesses,  the  large  number  of  unsustainable 
microenterprises,  and  the  stagnation  of  larger 
firms all suggest that the process of market se-
lection and creative destruction that has under-
pinned the rapid growth of transition economies 
and East Asian countries in the past decades is 
weak in most developing countries. This weak-
ness  impedes  labor  and  other  resources  from 
moving toward their most productive uses and 
undermines both job creation and productivity 
growth. Gains from tackling the difficulties faced

by the start-ups and removing constraints to the 
growth of incumbents could be sizable, but the 
task is daunting (question 3).57

*   *   *

Jobs can have an impact on the productivity of 
others, beyond the jobholder and the economic 
unit where they belong. Jobs that have these ad-
ditional impacts do more (or less) for develop-
ment.  These  additional  impacts  arise  because 
jobs  differ  in  the  way  they  connect  with  each 
other, and some of the connections do not oc-
cur through markets. In functional cities, ideas 

are  exchanged  among  people  more  effectively, 
making  everybody  more  productive.  In  clus-
ters, similar firms that locate next to each other 
tend to benefit from a broader pool of qualified 
workers  and  common  support  services.  Firms 
also  connect  with  foreign  businesses  through 
trade and investment, and, in integrating with 
global value chains, they can acquire more ad-
vanced  knowledge,  technology,  and  manage-
ment know-how. In all these ways, specific jobs 
can  contribute  to  productivity  gains  of  others 
and elsewhere in the economy. But effects can 
be  negative  as  well  if  jobs  overuse  natural  re-
sources  or  damage  the  environment,  thus  re-
ducing aggregate productivity.

QUeStION 3

Can entrepreneurship be fostered?

Self-employment  is  prevalent  in  developing 
countries,  and  micro-  and  small  enterprises 
are a major source of livelihood for low-skilled 
workers.  Even  if  only  a  small  fraction  of  these 
tiny  economic  units  succeeded  in  building  a  
viable business, with the potential to hire others, 
the aggregate effect on living standards would be 
substantial. Their success would also matter for 
productivity reasons. Quite a few currently large 
enterprises in industrial countries started out as 
 micro- and small family businesses. By contrast, 
in developing countries many large enterprises 
are  born  large,  often  the  result  of  government 
support or privileged access to finance and in-
formation. Breaking privileges is one more rea-
son  why  the  success  of  microenterprises  is  so 
important.

Views  differ  on  whether  there  is  scope  to 
help the self-employed succeed. At one time al-
most every self-employed person or owner of a 
microenterprise  was  seen  as  a  potential  entre-
preneur, held back only by regulatory zeal and 
corruption. Substantial rates of return on capital 
for micro- and small enterprises were viewed as 
evidence of a potential to thrive.58 But the pen-
dulum has swung, and the conventional wisdom 
is now rather pessimistic. The large numbers of 
unregistered self-employed in developing coun-
tries  are  viewed  as  subsistence   entrepreneurs 
who  are  trying  to  make  ends  meet,  not  thriv-
ing.59  Evidence  on  the  growth  of  micro-  and 
small  enterprises  in  several  countries  in  Latin 
America and West Africa shows that most micro-
enterprises with at least two years of operations 
remain  at  their  start-up  employment  levels.60 
Embedded in the pessimism of the conventional 
wisdom  is  the  idea  that  entrepreneurial  ability 
and skills cannot be easily transferred, especially 
not to adults with limited formal education. In 
this view, entrepreneurs are born, not made. If 
this view is correct, attempts to convert survivor-
ship into entrepreneurship are bound to fail. The 
wide dispersion of productivity across firms, in-
cluding across microenterprises, suggests, how-
ever,  that  reality  is  somewhere  in  between  the 
optimistic  and  the  pessimistic  view:  survivor-

ship may be dominant, but entrepreneurship is 
unlikely to be missing altogether. 

Who is an entrepreneur?

Observable  characteristics  of 

Entrepreneurship  combines  innovative  capac-
ity to put new ideas into effect with managerial 
capacity to increase a firm’s efficiency within the 
limits of known technology. Specific psychologi-
cal  traits  are  associated  with  entrepreneurship, 
such as a personal need for achievement, a belief 
in the effect of personal effort on outcomes, self-
confidence,  and  a  positive  attitude  toward  risk. 
These traits are difficult to observe or measure. 
But surveys comparing entrepreneurs with other 
workers in places as diverse as China and the Rus-
sian Federation show that observable individual 
characteristics  such  as  education,  experience, 
gender,  location,  and  age  are  good  predictors  
of entrepreneurship.61 Among microenterprises, 
rates of return on capital tend to be higher when 
their owners are more educated and experienced.
the  self- 
employed can thus be used to identify individu-
als  who  have  potential  to  become  successful 
entrepreneurs.62  To  illustrate  the  point,  a  suc-
cessful entrepreneur is defined as someone who 
employs others and is not living in poverty. The 
share of this group in total employment is small 
and  relatively  stable  across  countries  at  differ-
ent  levels  of  development.63  The  share  of  self- 
employed workers without paid employees, on 
the other hand, initially increases and then de-
clines with GDP per capita (figure 3.14a). At its 
peak, which corresponds to low-income coun-
tries, the share of self-employed workers with-
out paid employees reaches almost three-fifths 
of total employment. Among this group, a ma-
jority are individuals with relatively low poten-
tial to succeed. Their characteristics are closer to 
those of wage workers than of employers.64 

However, if each of the self-employed work-
ers with high potential were to create a single ad-
ditional  job,  total  employment  would  increase 
substantially, somewhat more so in low-income 
countries (figure 3.14b).  As a share of the work-

ing age population, such additional job creation 
would amount to 8 percent in Kenya, 5 percent 
in the Arab Republic of Egypt and 4 percent in 
Costa Rica.

While this calculation is hypothetical, several 
studies report that observable characteristics of 
micro-  and  small  informal  enterprise  owners, 
such  as  education  and  gender,  are  important 
determinants  of  innovation  and  employment 
growth.65  In  Mexico,  after  a  business  registra-
tion  reform,  informal  enterprise  owners  with 
observable traits similar to those found among 
formal  enterprise  owners  were  more  likely  to 
register their business than those similar to wage 
workers.66

What constrains entrepreneurship?

Even  potentially  skilled  entrepreneurs  would 
have  difficulty  succeeding  without  access  to 
basic  infrastructure  and  financial  resources.  In 
their  absence,  managerial  capacity  alone  may 
not be enough to realize productivity gains and 
employment  expansion.  The  investment  cli-
mate matters for business performance as well. 

Removing obstacles to firm growth is thus a pre-
requisite to foster entrepreneurship. 

Obstacles  notwithstanding,  entrepreneurial 
capacity  varies  substantially  across  microen-
terprises and small firms. A distinction is often 
made between innovative or transformative en-
trepreneurs and replicative or subsistence entre-
preneurs.67 The former correspond to Schumpe-
terian type of entrepreneurs, while the latter, who 
generally manage micro- and small enterprises, 
are followers. Such a distinction, however, does 
not capture the broader gradation of managerial 
performance that lies between the transformative 
and subsistence extremes. A study of the number 
of management practices adopted by the owners 
of micro- and small enterprises in Sub-Saharan 
Africa  reveals  a  large  variation  of  management 
scores (figure 3.15). These scores are closely as-
sociated  with  business  performance.68  A  broad 
dispersion of management scores is also found 
among relatively larger firms in India.69

An emerging literature confirms the impor-
tance  of  management  practices  in  explaining 
firm productivity. Although much of the focus 
is on large firms, recent studies have turned their

attention to how innovation in small and me-
dium firms takes place. The most telling studies 
involve management training provided for free 
to randomly selected firms whose performance 
is then compared to that of a control group of 
firms.  Evaluations  of  these  programs  find  that 
the training improves the financial literacy and 
basic management skills of business owners. The 
estimated impact is also positive, but less robust, 
when it comes to improved business outcomes 
and job creation. Better outcomes are associated 
with  business  owners  who  already  had  an  ini-
tial understanding of the concepts and relatively 
better access to financial resources. 

On the other hand, similarly designed inter-
ventions  to  provide  financial  resources  to  mi-
croenterprises,  or  to  process  their  registration 
with authorities, or to pay the salary of an ad-
ditional employee, show mixed impacts on busi-
ness  performance.70  In  Mexico  and  Sri  Lanka, 
grants  given  to  microenterprises  increase  the 
income of their owners—and then only if they 
are male—but do not result in employment cre-
ation. In Ghana, similar grants given to female 
business  owners  do  not  result  in  significant 
growth of their microenterprises. In Sri Lanka, 
only 22 percent of eligible microenterprises took 

up an offer of a wage subsidy covering 50 percent 
of the cost of hiring a worker for six months and 
25 percent of the cost for another two months. 
Overall, these results suggest that lack of access 
to finance is not the only constraint. 

Entrepreneurial skills, measured by the edu-
cation  of  business  owners  and  their  partici-
pation in training, explain a large share of the 
 differences in productivity across firms and re-
gions in developing countries.71 Yet markets fail 
to  nurture  entrepreneurship,  because  knowl-
edge spillovers imply that some of the returns to 
acquiring  or  developing  new  managerial  ideas 
are  appropriated  by  others.  More  important 
perhaps,  entrepreneurs  themselves  do  not  rec-
ognize the relevance of management expertise.72 
Only 3 percent of Brazil’s owners of micro- and 
small enterprises, for instance, see management 
as a binding business constraint.73 This may be 
an area where information and knowledge fail-
ures  matter,  leading  to  a  vicious  circle  of  low 
productivity,  low  living  standards,  and  insuffi-
cient job creation.

The  capacity  to  acquire  skills  and  to  apply 
them to business seems to be one of the most 
important characteristics of successful entrepre-
neurs. Success also depends on having core skills

such as numeracy and literacy, as well as social 
skills. A vast literature highlights the importance 
of entrepreneurs’ schooling as a determinant of 
firm growth, employment, and efficiency.74 Rus-
sian  and  Chinese  business  owners  have  more 
entrepreneurs  in  their  families  and  among 
childhood friends than otherwise similar indi-
viduals, suggesting that social environment also 
matters.75

Learning  can  also  happen  through  jobs. 
Nearly  half  of  entrepreneurs  managing  the  50 
largest  manufacturing  firms  in  Ethiopia  be-
gan their careers in trading companies, thereby 
learning about the market and what it takes to 
meet  demand.76  A  large  number  of  founders 
and  leading  entrepreneurs  in  the  light  manu-
facturing  industries  in  Asia  and  Sub-Saharan 
Africa were initially traders or employees in the 
marketing division of large enterprises.77 

Integration in supply chains with larger, of-
ten  foreign,  firms,  is  receiving  much  attention 
as  a  potential  source  of  knowledge  transfers.78 
Indian  entrepreneurs  returning  from  Silicon 
Valley made Bangalore a hub of the information 
technology industry. Perhaps the most dramatic 
evidence attesting to the importance of learning 

from abroad can be found in the case of the gar-
ment industry in Bangladesh (box 3.4).

The case for targeted management 
training

Managerial  practices  are  linked  to  differences 
in  productivity,  profitability,  firm  growth,  and 
survival.79  The  development  experience  of  the 
garment  industry  in  Bangladesh  suggests  that 
entrepreneurship  can  be  fostered  by  exposure 
to  advanced  management  practices  and  tech-
nologies. But whether managerial capacity can 
be  improved  through  management  training  is 
more  debatable.  Creativity,  foresight,  and  risk 
taking are key elements of any innovative pro-
cess, but the question is whether they can be dif-
fused and nurtured.

A  substantial  number  of  experiments  have 
been conducted in recent years, providing evi-
dence  of  both  successes  and  failures  of  man-
agement  training  interventions.  Some  patterns 
emerge from a systematic review of the available 
evidence. To be successful, management training 
must be kept simple, appropriate teaching ma-
terials must be available, and the training must 

BOX 3.4    What explains the boom in the garment industry in Bangladesh?

The garment industry in Bangladesh illustrates how important it is 
to learn advanced management practices, marketing, and technol-
ogies from abroad. When Daewoo Corporation of Korea teamed up 
with Bangladesh’s Desh Ltd. to produce garments for export in Ban-
gladesh in 1979, the South Asian country had no modern industry. 
Little more than 20 years later, the industry was generating more 
than  US$12.5  billion  in  export  revenue.  Women  accounted  for  80 
percent of its 3.6 million workers

Arguably, a wide set of factors, from financial innovation to pol-
icy support, contributed to this development success. But it began 
in 1979, when Desh sent 130 newly recruited, educated employees 
to Daewoo’s garment factory in Korea, where they participated in an 
eight-month intensive training course covering topics from sewing 
skills to factory management, quality control, and international pro-
curement and marketing—skills that they then applied in the Desh 
factories in Bangladesh. Within a few years, almost all the trainees 
had left Desh to start their own garment businesses. Some of the 
ex-Desh workers joined new garment factories established by afflu-
ent businessmen, while others founded trading houses, which then 

contributed to the proliferation of garment manufacturers by pro-
viding a variety of valuable services including international procure-
ment and marketing, sample making, and design reengineering.

Observing Desh’s good start in exporting, and subsequently the 
success  of  ex-Desh  workers,  highly  educated  people  started  their 
own garment businesses, and wealthy families actively invested in 
the industry. As a result, the size of garment firms has been quite 
large  since  the  beginning;  their  average  size  was  300  workers  in 
1983–84 and 700 in 2010–11. As of 2005, owners of garment firms 
had 15 years of schooling on average, and about 60 percent of them 
had completed college or university education. 

Learning  from  abroad  continued.  Some  entrepreneurs  partici-
pated in training programs in Singapore, Japan, and Europe. Beyond 
garment  enterprises  in  Korea,  other  newly  industrial  countries  in 
East  Asia  followed  Daewoo  into  operation  in  Bangladesh  and  in-
vested in training Bangladeshi workers and managers. Thus, many 
Bangladeshi traders and manufacturers had work experience in gar-
ment trading and production, including the experience of working 
at joint ventures, before starting their current businesses.

last for a certain minimum length of time. Com-
plementing classroom teaching with instructors’ 
visits to trainees on the job can yield significant 
positive effects.80 In Mexico, for example, such 
on-site  visits  improved  sales,  profits,  and  pro-
ductivity.81 But in Ghana, on-site visits and sup-
port for microenterprises were not successful.82 
It is also possible that key entrepreneurial skills 
are gained more effectively through work expe-
rience  in  large  productive  firms  than  through 
training programs.83

Entrepreneurship  training  for  women  has 
had  mixed  results.  Nurturing  female  entrepre-
neurship has the potential to create wider social 
benefits  associated  with  female  employment, 
such as changes in the household allocation of 
resources that improve family well-being, espe-
cially of children. Female entrepreneurship often 
provides employment opportunities to women 
that  allow  them  to  balance  work  and  family 
roles. Yet providing classroom training to female 
microentrepreneurs in Peru had no effect on key 
business outcomes such as sales and profits, even 
when some business practices improved.84 Class-
room training complemented with on-site visits, 
though,  yielded  positive  results.85  In  Pakistan 
and  Tanzania,  management  training  improved 
management  practices  and  business  outcomes 
for male but not female entrepreneurs.86 These 
mixed results can also reflect wider constraints 
facing women in societies, including access to ef-
fective learning in schools.

A common finding of training evaluations is 
that the potential to absorb management prac-
tices differs greatly among beneficiaries. Readily 
observable  individual  characteristics  can  help 

identify those business owners with the highest 
potential  to  benefit  from  management  train- 
ing. Expert panels may be used to identify and 
rank micro- and small enterprises on their po-
tential  to  grow,  but  such  methods  are  expen-
sive  and  difficult  to  apply  on  a  large  scale.  An 
effective  alternative  is  a  survey  questionnaire 
designed to capture abilities, attitudes, and man-
agement scores of potential trainees.87 Manage-
ment  training  itself  can  be  used  as  a  screening 
device. Trainees with high potential often under-
take new investments and expand employment 
as a result of their training. Financial institutions 
could view such activity as an indication of po-
tentially high investment returns. Programs that 
combine  management  training  with  financial 
support yield better firm performance in devel-
oping countries.88 

Training  programs  can  be  implemented  by 
private providers and financed by private inves-
tors with a significant interest in the success of 
the entrepreneurs in whom they have invested. 
But  as  long  as  there  are  knowledge  spillovers 
and  the  importance  of  management  expertise 
is undervalued, governments have a role to play. 
Given the differing capabilities among business 
owners, proper targeting is crucial to ensure pos-
itive returns to publicly funded programs. Ran-
domized  experiments  in  Ghana,  Tanzania,  and 
Vietnam  indicate  that  the  benefit  of  such  pro-
grams generally outweighs the cost, even though 
the  costs  of  implementing  training  programs 
vary greatly.89 If the overall investment climate is 
not conducive to private sector growth, however, 
targeted  training  programs  for  better  business 
skills will most likely return meager results.

  1.  Labor  force  is  used  instead  of  employment  in 
figure  3.1.  Over  a  long  term  (10-year  period), 
changes in unemployment rates are small, in gen-
eral, and employment in an economy is driven by 
the size of its labor force.

  3.  Gross job creation is the sum of all additions to 
total  employment.  It  occurs  when  expanding 
economic units hire workers and when new eco-
nomic units are created. In principle, economic 
units can be as small as a one-person microen-
terprise,  but  most  quantitative  analyses  refer  to 
establishments employing several workers. Gross 
job  destruction  is  the  sum  of  all  employment 
losses.  It  occurs  when  economic  units  close  or 
contract in size. Net job creation is the difference 
between these two gross flows. Job creation and 
destruction  rates  measure  how  many  employ-
ment positions emerge or disappear in a specific 
period (typically one year) relative to the number 
of existing positions. See Bartelsman, Haltiwan-

26.  See  also  Ayyagari,  Demirgüç-Kunt,  and  Maksi-
movic (2011b) for analysis based on World Bank 
enterprise  surveys;  the  analysis  suggests  that 
small  firms  contribute  significantly  to  employ-
ment and job creation.

mous.  See  Barrett,  Bellemare,  and  Hou  2010;

29.  For example, in Kenya in 2007, the family labor 
input  per  hectare  in  maize  production  was  418 
hours for the top quartile of farms (measured by 
size), but that input reached 1,032 hours for the 
bottom quartile.

30.  The  positive  relationship  is  found  not  only  in 
such high-wage economies as Japan but also in 
India recently. See Foster and Rosenzweig 2011; 
Hayami and Kawagoe 1989.

31.  Evenson and Gollin 2003.
32.  World  Bank  2007.  Improvement  in  agriculture 
technology  can  lead  to  fast  growth  in  produc-
tivity  in  the  sector  and  convergence  in  aggre-
gate productivity. On the basis of data from 50 
countries over 1967–92, Martin and Mitra (2001) 
found  that  productivity  growth  in  agriculture 
was faster than in manufacturing in these coun-
tries over the period.

33.  However, TFP has been increasing since the early 
1980s, suggesting that the Green Revolution has 
taken place in some areas of Sub-Saharan Africa.

40.  Pagés  2010.  Figures  are  based  on  physical  pro-
ductivity (or TFPQ), as defined by Foster, Halti-
wanger,  and  Syverson  (2008).  This  factor  is  a 
measure of real output per unit of input, which 
is  computed  using  plant-level  price  deflators. 
TFPQ  is  more  precise  than  TFPR—a  revenue 
proxy for TFPQ that is computed using industry-
level price deflators. TFPQ is a preferred measure 
because TFPR combines the effects of quantities 
and  prices.  Quantities  and  prices  are  affected  
by  demand  factors,  quality  differences,  mark-
ups, and potential distortions. A survey of earlier 
studies based on TFPR did not find a higher dis-
persion of productivity in developing countries, 
but  those  studies  are  not  very  informative  be-
cause they are based on outdated methodologies.

Jobs and social cohesion

Jobs can shape social interactions and the ways societies manage  
collective decision making. They connect people with others  
and can provide access to voice.

Jobs influence who we are and our relations 

with  others.  In  most  societies,  jobs  are  a 
fundamental  source  of  self-respect  and 
social  identity.  Historically,  family  names  in 
some cultures were associated with specific oc-
cupations  because  people  defined  themselves 
by  what  they  did:  Miller  in  English,  Hurudza 
(master farmer) in Shona, and Suthar (carpen-
ters) in Hindi.

Jobs  connect  people  with  others  through 
networks. The workplace can be a place to en-
counter new ideas and information and to inter-
act with people of different ethnicities. The dis-
tribution of jobs within society and perceptions 
about who has access to opportunities and why 
can shape people’s expectations and aspirations 
for  the  future,  their  sense  of  having  a  stake  in 
society, and perceptions of fairness. 

These  individual  influences  of  jobs  may 
have  collective  consequences.  Having  or  not 
having a job may affect key elements of social 
cohesion,  the  capacity  of  societies  to  manage 
collective  decision  making  peacefully.  While 
the  frustration  of  unemployed  youth  during 
the Arab Spring suggests that the lack of jobs 
can be a source of social unrest, that does not 
mean  that  the  relationship  between  jobs  and 
social cohesion is straightforward, immediate, 
or direct. Rather, the relationship is contextual 
and  shaped  by  individuals,  their  values,  atti-
tudes, and behaviors, and the institutions that 
surround them. And it goes both ways: social 

cohesion  can  also  influence  jobs  by  shaping  
the  context  in  which  entrepreneurs  make  in-
vestment decisions. 

Empirical evidence of a connection between 
jobs and social cohesion is limited by data con-
straints,  the  complexity  of  measuring  social 
interactions,  and  the  multiple  factors  that  can 
contribute  to  social  cohesion.  However,  cross-
country analysis of values surveys finds that job 
loss or lack of access to jobs is associated with 
lower levels of trust and civic engagement. This 
is not only a rich-country phenomenon, as is of-
ten suggested. Unemployment can cause depres-
sion, increase mistrust in others, and lead people 
to drop out of community life. Migrants without 
social ties may be excluded from job opportuni-
ties  that  would  allow  them  to  succeed  in  their 
new environments. In extreme cases, if people, 
particularly youth, lack jobs and hope for the fu-
ture, they may turn to violent or criminal activ-
ity to compensate for the absence of self-esteem 
and sense of belonging that a job might other-
wise provide. Similarly, jobs offering limited op-
portunities  for  future  growth  or  lacking  access 
to voice can lead to alienation and frustration.

Some jobs are positively correlated with so-
cial  cohesion.  Jobs  that  are  empowering,  build 
agency, and provide access to voice can increase 
trust  and  people’s  willingness  to  participate  in 
civil society. Jobs can create economic and social 
ties  and  have  the  potential  to  build  incentives 
to work across boundaries and resolve conflict. 

 

Jobs and social cohesion

And people’s trust in government and their con-
fidence in institutions may increase if they be-
lieve that job opportunities are available to them 
either now or in the future. Jobs can influence 
social  cohesion  through  their  effects  on  social 
identity, networks, and fairness.

Jobs can help manage social 
tensions 

News reports about the financial crisis and the 
Arab Spring have broadcast a common senti-
ment  that  unemployment,  especially  among 
young people, can ignite unrest and violence.1 
In  September  2010,  a  Telegraph  headline  re-
ported  that  the “IMF  Fears ‘Social  Explosion’ 
from  World  Jobs  Crisis”  ahead  of  a  summit 
of  the  International  Monetary  Fund  and  the 
International  Labour  Organization  (ILO).2  In 
2011,  Le  Monde  linked  jobs  and  social  unrest 
in  Tunisia  to  concerns  about  social  justice: 
“protesters  aren’t  asking  the  Government  to 
find  them  a  job,  but  denouncing  the  lack  of 
transparency and justice in the labor market.”3 
The  revolution  in  Tunisia  was  sparked  by  the 
protests of a fruit vendor frustrated by his in-
ability to get a permit to do his job. High lev-
els of youth unemployment were a significant 
contributing  factor  to  the  riots  in  the  United 
Kingdom in the summer of 2011.4 

These  events  suggest  that  jobs  can  contrib-
ute  to  social  cohesion,  including  how  societies 
handle differences and manage tensions among 
different groups, and how they avoid and resolve 
conflicts.  There  are  many  possible  ways  to  de-
fine social cohesion (box 4.1). But overall,  social 
cohesion  refers  to  the  capacity  of  societies  to 
peacefully manage collective decision making.5 
Social cohesion thus relates to the processes and 
institutions  that  shape  how  groups  interact.  It 
does not follow that collective decision making 
should be imposed from above, but rather that 
channels for voice, accountability, and inclusive 
participation  of  diverse  groups  can  contribute 
to a cohesive society.

Trust and civic engagement matter . . .

The capacity of a country to support peaceful 
collective  decision  making  involves  multiple 
factors  including  the  quality  of  institutions, 

intergroup  relations,  and  the  effectiveness  of 
channels for resolving conflicts. Cross-country 
data  on  political  stability,  the  absence  of  vio-
lence, and voice and accountability can be used 
to construct an index of social cohesion at the 
country  level.6  The  Nordic  countries,  Swit-
zerland, and New Zealand, score high on this 
index. Although the index is a static measure, 
the capacity for peaceful decision making can 
evolve  over  time  as  societies  change,  through 
urbanization,  more  female  employment,  and 
the growth of a middle class.

The nature of the interactions through jobs 
affects the degree of social cohesion in commu-
nities and societies. Trust and civic engagement 
are  two  measurable  indicators  of  social  cohe-
sion at the individual level. These indicators are 
associated  with  the  country-level  index  of  the 
capacity for peaceful collective decision making 
(figure 4.1).

Trust refers to the extent to which individu-
als have confidence in people whom they know 
personally,  including  family  and  neighbors.7  It 
can also refer to trust in people met for the first 
time  and  in  people  of  different  religions  and 
nationalities.   Civic  engagement  captures  the 
extent  to  which  people  participate  voluntarily 
in civil society by joining community organiza-
tions,  unions,  political  parties,  or  religious  or-
ganizations, and by engaging in civic life. These 
forms  of  involvement  and  activism  include 
nonviolent activity, such as participating in pro-
tests,  that  can  be  constructive  for  social  cohe-
sion. Civic engagement relates to social capital, 
 participation, and the agency that motivates in-
dividuals to be part of collective action.

. . . and they are influenced by jobs

Trust  and  civic  engagement  can  be  linked  to 
jobs.  Having—or  not  having—a  job  may  af-
fect the way people view the world by influenc-
ing their values and attitudes, including trust in 
others and in institutions. Jobs can also provide 
channels  for  people  to  interact  across  diverse 
groups.  Jobs  with  certain  characteristics  may 
contribute more to trust and civic engagement 
than others. 

Not having a job is associated with less self-
reported trust in high-income countries (figure 
4.2a).  The  relationship  is  stronger  with  civic 
engagement, where unemployment is linked to

BOX 4.1    What is social cohesion?

The concept can be traced as far back as the writings of Ibn Khaldun, 
a Muslim scholar born in Tunis in the 15th century, whose idea of 
asabiyah is generally translated as “social cohesion.” Living during 
times of manifold conflicts, Khaldun regarded asabiyah as the soli-
darity  of  small  groups  (tribes)  that  has  the  power  to  promote 
broader social integration.a

Four  centuries  later,  Emile  Durkheim  considered  cohesion  in  
the  context  of  societal  transformation.b  He  was  particularly  con-
cerned  with  two  different  types  of  solidarity  that  he  observed 
emerging  through  industrialization  in  Europe.  Primitive  societies, 
he found, were marked by mechanical solidarity and a strong col-
lective  ethos  based  on  relatively  homogeneous  patterns  of  life  
and work. Advanced capitalist society, in contrast, with its complex 
division of labor, was marked by organic solidarity based on merit, 
respect for different roles within the labor force, and the need for 
moral regulation.

More recently, social cohesion has been related to social capital. 
In the 1990s, Pierre Bourdieu and others focused on the benefits 
that accrue to individuals through their participation in groups and 
the need for individuals to invest in these relations. Robert Putnam’s 
analysis of the conditions for creating responsive, effective, and rep-
resentative  institutions  builds  on  this  theme.  Famously,  northern 
Italy had more of these institutions than southern Italy, and Putnam 
concluded  that  the  central  enabling  condition  was  the  existence  
of  more  social  capital,  measured  through  the  density  of  local 
associations.c Social cohesion can be understood as a broader con-
cept than social capital in that it considers intergroup relations in 
a wider context. Easterly, Ritzen, and Woolcock define social cohe-
sion (or lack thereof) as “the nature and extent of social and eco-

nomic  divisions  within  society  (income,  ethnicity,  political  party, 
caste, language).”d

Although  social  cohesion  has  multiple  definitions  with  differ-

ences in focus and emphasis, some common threads emerge:
•   Social cohesion is generally viewed as a positive concept. It can be 
an end in itself, as well as a means. The Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation  and  Development  describes  a  cohesive  society  as 
one that “works towards the well-being of all its members.”e The 
French Commissariat General du Plan defines social cohesion as “a 
set of social processes that help instill in individuals the sense of 
belonging to the same community and the feeling that they are 
recognized as members of the community.”f

•   Social  cohesion  relates  to  the  interactions  among  individuals, 
groups, and societies. These interactions are seen as “the forces 
holding the individuals within the groupings in which they are” 
and as linking diverse groups together.g

•   Social  cohesion  contributes  to  sustainable  social  development. 
According to the Club de Madrid, “shared societies are stable, safe 
and just and based on the promotion and protection of all human 
rights . . . , including disadvantaged and vulnerable groups and 
persons.”h

•   Last, some definitions of social cohesion relate the concept to pro-
cesses and institutional characteristics. For example, social cohesion 
can  refer  to  “the  capacity  of  societies  (not  just  groups,  networks)  
to peacefully manage collective action problems.”i This definition 
links social cohesion to participation and civic engagement.

lower  participation  in  associations  and  dem-
onstrations, and signing petitions (figures 4.2b, 
c,  and  d).  With  the  exception  of  low-income 
countries, the relationship between unemploy-
ment and active membership in an association 
is significant and negative. The mixed findings 
on  trust  and  unemployment  underscore  that 
unemployment may not always be a meaningful 
concept in low-income countries. Open unem-
ployment is frequently low in developing coun-
tries and is not always concentrated among the 
worse-off,  because  most  people  work  to  make 
ends  meet  in  the  absence  of  social  safety  nets. 

In developing countries, the type of job, the op-
portunities  the  job  provides,  and  the  way  jobs 
connect people may be more relevant for social 
cohesion.

Further indications of a connection between 
jobs  and  social  cohesion  comes  from  looking  
at  job  characteristics.  The  2005  wave  of  the 
World Values Survey asks people whether their 
jobs involve manual or cognitive, routine or cre-
ative  tasks,  and  how  much  independence  they 
have  at  work.  An  index  of  these  self- reported 
characteristics  captures  how  motivating  a  job 
is. The index is positively associated with trust

Note: The analysis includes 56 countries (panel a) and 49 countries (panel b). “Index of peaceful collective decision making” is an average of indicators of “voice and accountability” 
and “political stability and the absence of violence” from the Worldwide Governance Indicators. “Index of civic engagement” is the average of responses to questions from the World 
Values Survey on (a) active membership in associations; (b) whether the respondent participated or would participate in a demonstration; and (c) whether the respondent would 
sign a petition.

in  high-  and  upper-middle-income  countries 
(figure 4.3a). This relationship is not significant 
in  lower-middle-  and  low-income  countries. 
Holding a job with perceived cognitive, creative, 
and autonomous attributes is positively linked 
with  civic  engagement  indicators  in  all  but  
low-income  countries  (figures  4.3b,  4.3c,  and 
4.3d).9 Similarly, in surveys conducted in 2012 
in China, Colombia, and the Arab Republic of 
Egypt,  workers  who  perceived  that  their  jobs 
involved  more  autonomy  and  greater  creative 
and cognitive content were more likely to report 
helping other people.10

More than correlations?

As suggestive as they are, these relationships be-
tween jobs and social cohesion do not establish 
causality. While unemployed people may be less 
likely to trust others or join associations, people 
with less trust in others may also be more likely 
to be unemployed or not participate in civil so-

ciety. Moreover, trust and civic participation are 
influenced by peer and social interaction effects 
(such  as  the  trust  or  participation  of  others), 
which can make it difficult to draw conclusions.
While the primary focus is on how jobs can 
contribute to trust and civic engagement, this re-
lationship goes in both directions. There are ways 
in which social cohesion can affect jobs. Trust and 
social capital (an element of civic engagement) 
may  create  an  economic  and  political  environ-
ment  that  is  conducive  to  economic  growth.11 
Trust can reduce transaction costs and overcome 
market failures that arise because of uncertainty; 
it can reduce costs related to search and informa-
tion, policing and enforcement, and bargaining 
and decision making; and it can be the basis for 
the  transmission  and  exchange  of  knowledge  
and allow for innovation, coordination, and co-
operation  among  firms.12  Meanwhile,  factors 
such as mistrust, discrimination, fragmentation 
along  ethnic  lines,  or  inequality  can  also  influ-
ence whether jobs are created, and what kind.

Note: The analysis includes 54 countries. The vertical axis shows the marginal probability (d-probit coefficient) of individuals’ self-reported trust or civic engagement on being 
unemployed. The estimates control for the income, education, and demographic characteristics of respondents. Trust is based on the question, “Generally speaking, would you say 
that most people can be trusted or that you need to be very careful in dealing with people?” Civic engagement variables are (a) whether the respondent is an active member of 
one or more of nine different associations; (b) whether the respondent attended or would attend a demonstration; or (c) whether the respondent signed or would sign a petition. 
The line indicates the 95 percent confidence interval of each coefficient. If the line crosses the horizontal axis, the corresponding coefficient is not statistically significant. 

Evidence  of  a  directional  link  between  em-
ployment  status  and  civic  engagement  comes 
from a survey in Indonesia that tracked partici-
pation  in  community  meetings  and  volunteer 
activities and interviewed the same respondents 
in  2000  and  2007.13  On  average,  participation  
in  community  activities  increased  8  percent 
during the period, but it increased at different 
rates  among  people  with  different  work  histo-
ries (figure 4.4).14 

Controlling  for  other  factors,  men  and 
women  who  were  working  in  2000  but  not  in 
2007 were less likely to be participating in com-
munity  activities  than  others.  Conversely,  men 
and women who were not working in 2000 but 
were  working  in  2007  were  significantly  more 
likely  to  be  involved  in  community  activities 
than  those  who  were  not  working  in  2007.15

explain these findings; for example, people who

get sick lose their jobs and their ability to partici-
pate in the community. New cross-country anal-
ysis from Europe and Latin America suggests a 
casual relationship between employment status 
and trust in others and institutions (box 4.2).16
The  empirical  results  relating  unemploy-
ment,  trust,  and  civic  engagement  imply  that 
losing  a  job  means  more  than  losing  income. 
Job  loss  can  undermine  feelings  of  self-worth 
and strain family and social relationships. Un-

employment  can  break  economic  and  social 
ties, breed mistrust, and damage people’s sense 
of community and hope for the future. Not hav-
ing a job can mean losing social status as well 
as  not  being  able  to  provide  income  for  one’s 
family. A man laid off after 24 years of work in a 
factory in Serbia explained, “I automatically lost 
everything. I lost any freedom and power I had. 
Every thing  was  lost.”17  Ethnographies  of  com-

that experienced widespread job losses in con-
texts of limited new job creation are remarkably 
consistent in their accounts of the social impli-
cations of long-term unemployment (box 4.3).

For communities, job loss appears to foster 
mistrust not only toward former employers or 
government  authorities  suspected  of  being  in-
different or responsible for the lack of employ-
ment opportunities but also among neighbors, 
former colleagues, and friends. This frustration 
may  contribute  to  general  dissatisfaction  with 
the  political  environment.  An  empirical  study 
using the World Values Survey in 69 countries 
finds that joblessness can be linked with nega-
tive views about the effectiveness of democracy 
and  preferences  for  a  rogue  leader.18  Insecure 
jobs or jobs that people find demoralizing can 
have effects similar to those of unemployment. 
The lack of status, job security, or voice at work 
can lead people to feel disempowered and hope-
less about the future and to stop participating in 
social networks.19

In  extreme  cases,  unemployment  can  con-
tribute  to  violence  or  social  unrest.  Youth  in 
particular  may  turn  to  gangs  or  other  violent 
groups to compensate for the lack of ties in eco-
nomic and social life.20 A longitudinal study of 
youth in Ecuador found that members of gangs 

BOX 4.2    Do jobs cause trust? Analysis of Eurobarometer and Latinobarómetro Surveys 

An analysis using the Latinobarómetro and Eurobarometer values 
surveys during the 2000s makes it possible to study the evolution of 
trust and jobs and links in both directions. The surveys include ques-
tions  on  interpersonal  trust  and  trust  in  institutions.  Cohorts  are 
defined  and  examined  in  the  different  survey  years.  The  analysis 
looks  at  how  social  cohesion  and  employment  conditions  for  the 
cohorts evolve over time, controlling for certain country characteris-
tics  that  could  be  correlated  with  both  trust  and  employment 
status.

The  dataset  captures  important  features  of  the  formation  of 
social cohesion, because perceptions of trust and civic participation 
are  highly  influenced  by  peer  and  social  interaction  effects.  For 
instance,  an  individual’s  propensity  to  trust  other  people  or  the 
state depends on the perceived or actual trust of others belonging 
to similar sociodemographic groups. 

The  model  simultaneously  allows  group  level  job  conditions, 
including unemployment and self-employment, to influence trust 
and vice versa. The empirics quantify how earlier changes in group-
level  employment  conditions  predict  their  trust  in  society  and  its 

institutions  over  time.  The  estimated  effects  measure  how  a  per-
centage  change  in,  say,  the  unemployment  rate  for  a  cohort  in  a 
given year predicts changes in the percentage of individuals of that 
same cohort reporting to trust in the subsequent year.

This  analysis  finds  that  increases  in  unemployment  are  fol- 
lowed by increases in trust among Europeans, but the opposite is 
true  among  Latin  Americans.  At  the  same  time,  increases  in  self-
employment lead to higher trust in Europe while the opposite is 
true in Latin America. These results hold in Latin America for trust 
both  in  government  and  in  others.  Conversely,  the  analysis  finds 
little evidence of a causal link from trust to jobs, except for a small 
negative  impact  of  self-employment  on  trust  in  government  in 
Latin  America.  These  results  may  reflect  the  higher  coverage  of 
social  protection  in  Europe  and  the  lower  importance  of  open 
unemployment in Latin America than in Europe. They are consis-
tent with evidence that in Latin America self-employment, while a 
last resort for many unable to find wage employment, is valued by 
some for the independence it provides.a

BOX 4.3    Displacement and unemployment can lead to the erosion of trust and ties

Downsizing of bauxite mines in Guyana 
The downsizing of bauxite mines in the absence of new opportuni-
ties  has  contributed  to  a  deterioration  in  family  and  community 
relationships in Linden, Guyana.a Between the early 1970s and the 
mid-1980s, bauxite mining near Linden was cut by half, and layoffs 
continued throughout the 1990s. By 1999, formal unemployment in 
Linden stood at about 40 percent, and residents complained of ris-
ing crime.

Once among the best-paid workers, miners were respected for 
their work and seen as drivers of the economy. People felt particu-
larly  demeaned  by  the  downsizing  process:  “The  people  off  the  
job  don’t  get  any  information.  They  treat  us  like  we  don’t  exist.  
Yet  .  .  .  before  we  came  off,  there  used  to  be  meetings  with  us, 
[about] what was happening.”b

Material  hardship  and  insecurity  took  a  harsh  toll  on  identity 
and the relations between men and women. Women directly linked 
men’s inability to retain their authority as breadwinners to domes-
tic violence. “Especially in cases of abuse, you would be surprised 
that after counseling them, the problem comes right back to the 
economic  situation.  The  man  can’t  provide  adequately  for  the 
home.”c  Indigence  was  linked  to  shocking  forms  of  child  neglect 
and  abuse.  Some  parents  were  said  to  be  prostituting  their  chil-
dren. The cultivation of cannabis, the use of cocaine, and involve-
ment in the international transshipment of drugs were said to be 
rapidly increasing among young men.

Downsizing  also  diminished  the  economic  resources  available  
to community organizations such as churches: “The churches are in 
crisis also. As individuals, we are part of the crisis, so we carry it into 
church and it in turn goes into society,” one person said.d

Regime change and unemployment in Bulgaria
Bulgaria  massively  downsized  its  unsustainable  state  enterprises 
following the end of the Communist regime. The disappearance of 

state jobs entailed the loss of numerous benefits, including health 
care and job security. In focus groups, people linked job loss to poor 
health, social isolation, and crime. Older men, in particular, lost face 
when they had to ask young relatives or employers for work. 

Unemployment  did  more  than  simply  weaken  social  ties;  it 
 created  distrust  and  mutual  suspicion.  The  restructuring  created 
winners  as  well,  and  they  also  suffered  from  the  mutual  distrust. 
People  who  had  lost  their  jobs  began  to  avoid  traditional  social 
gatherings because they were unable to afford gifts that they were 
expected  to  provide.  People  felt  that  security—once  linked  to 
good health, the opportunity to pursue personal and professional 
fulfillment, good personal relations, respect in the community, and 
social  cohesion—had  moved  out  of  reach.  In  communities  that 
were  once  relatively  equal,  people  identified  five  or  six  levels  of 
well-being. 

Economic reforms in Argentina
La  Matanza  is  a  city  of  1.2  million  outside  Buenos  Aires  that  was  
once a manufacturing center of textiles, diesel engines, household 
appliances, and steel. Economic transformations in the 1990s led to 
increased reliance on technology and skilled workers. Factories in La 
Matanza closed, and job opportunities became scarce. With mobil-
ity  low,  people  had  to  take  up  temporary  or  casual  jobs  without 
unemployment  or  health  insurance.  Those  who  managed  to  find 
jobs complained of exploitative pay, abusive treatment, and assaults 
to their dignity.

As elsewhere, job loss affected men and women’s relationships. 
While  some  men  adapted  to  a  more  egalitarian  role,  many  re -
sponded  to  the  blow  to  their  self-esteem  as  breadwinners  with 
depression  or  anger;  women  complained  that  violence  in  the 
household increased. Men felt joblessness undermined their roles 
in the family.

involved  with  drugs  and  guns  had  joined “be-
cause they were searching for the support, trust, 
and cohesion—social capital—that they main-
tained their families did not provide, as well as 
because of the lack of opportunities in the lo-
cal  context.”21  Similarly,  analysis  in  the  United 
States has found that gangs provide youth with 
the  income,  respect,  and  social  ties  that  they 
were  unable  to  find  in  jobs,  particularly  given 
the limited opportunities available in cities such 
as  Chicago  and  New York  that  had  lost  stable, 
unionized manufacturing jobs.22

The lack of jobs among dislocated popula-
tions,  including  migrants,  refugees,  and  dis-

placed  persons,  can  be  particularly  disorient-
ing.  It  can  influence  status  and  identity,  for 
example,  for  migrants  who  had  better  jobs  in 
their places of origin. The social effects of un-
employment  among  dislocated  populations 
may  be  especially  isolating  for  people  lacking 
family or other ties in their new communities. 
It can have implications for psychological well-
being, as well as the ability to participate in civil 
society. Even migrants who find work may be 
vulnerable if their jobs do not provide adequate 
channels to integrate within the new society or 
if the migrants lack voice or information about 
their rights.

Jobs (or the lack of jobs) can shape 
social interactions

The link between social cohesion and jobs is not 
necessarily direct or linear. Interactions between 
jobs  and  societies  are  contextual  and  multidi-
mensional; effects can be positive as well as nega-
tive. Having, or not having, a job can influence 
how people view themselves in relation to others, 
with  implications  for  values,  attitudes,  and  be-
haviors. Jobs can connect people with informa-
tion, economic activities, and other people. And 
how jobs are allocated can affect whether people 
think their society is fair and merit-based, believe 
they  have  a  stake  in  society,  and  have  expecta-
tions and aspirations for the future (Question 4). 

Jobs provide social identity

Some jobs can contribute positively to how peo-
ple view themselves and their relations with oth-
ers. The identity conveyed by a job can influence 
the  social  categories  that  individuals  associate 
with, their behaviors, and the norms that shape 
this behavior.23 In industrial countries, jobs that 
give people opportunities to learn and develop 
careers can be motivating and strengthen iden-
tity. In the United States, programs that provide 
skill development and growth opportunities to 
low-wage workers aim to strengthen self-esteem 
and motivation.24 Public and private sector ini-
tiatives to establish career ladders in health care, 

BOX 4.4    Jobs, motivation, and identity in Risaralda, 

Colombia 

David is the owner of a small shop in one of the rural areas of Risaralda. He was 
born in another part of Colombia but has lived in the region of Risaralda for 
some years now. He loves living in this area for the safety and peace that exists. 
He has had his shop, located next to the main street of his village, for around  
15 years. 

One  of  the  things  he  loves  the  most  about  his  job  is  the  deep  sense  of 
belonging to the community that it offers. When necessary, people come to his 
shop  and  ask  for  credit  for  the  goods  they  need.  Despite  a  few  unpaid  bills 
some of his customers have left him, he does his best to help the villagers. The 
income from the shop provides only enough to subsist, and it is necessary for 
him to engage in other businesses so that he can have an additional income. He 
feels that his shop is a way of giving back to the community and that by being 
there, he is able to provide for the needs of his neighbors.

child care, education, biotechnology, and manu-
facturing define job competencies and give em-
ployees the chance to develop skills, participate 
in  training,  and  increase  their  responsibility. 
Results from a program implemented in nurs-
ing homes in Massachusetts in the United States 
found that having opportunities for growth im-
proved communication and teamwork, reduced 
turnover, and built self-respect and confidence 
among staff.25 

Jobs  can  have  similar  effects  for  low-wage 
workers  in  developing  countries,  and  these  ef-
fects can have implications for social cohesion. 
The  growth  of  the  garment  sector  in  Bangla-
desh brought more than 3 million women into 
the  workplace. Although  the  factory  jobs  were 
physically demanding and poorly paid, they ex-
panded women’s autonomy and increased their 
opportunities  to  participate  in  public  life.26 “I 
am braver now,” a 26-year-old worker explained, 
“I understand more things which I did not be-
fore.”27 Observers noted that the sight of women 
walking back and forth to work changed popu-
lar notions about the acceptability of women in 
the public space and their right to access public 
institutions.28  Coworkers  travel  together,  share 
information  about  work  opportunities,  and 
form savings groups.29

The  effect  of  jobs  on  identity  also  holds 
for  self-employed  workers,  including  farmers 
(box 4.4). Jobs that provide access to voice can 
be  empowering  and  give  workers  a  stake  and 
shared interest in their work.30 Informal workers 
lack access to representation on the job and are 
similarly  excluded  from  local  government  and 
economic associations. Associations of self-em-
ployed workers and farmers help fill these gaps.31 
A  core  strategy  of  the  Self  Employed Women’s 
Association  (SEWA)  in  India  has  been  to  em-
power  its  members  and  partners  by  increasing 
their say in communities (box 4.5).

Jobs connect people

Some jobs bring people into contact with others 
whom they might not otherwise encounter, in-
cluding people of different ethnicities and social 
backgrounds (box 4.6). This connecting aspect 
of  jobs  can  contribute  to  social  cohesion.  Jobs

BOX 4.5    Voice can be extended to the self-employed: The case of SEWA

The Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) began in 1972 with 
a small group of migrant women cart pullers in the wholesale cloth 
market of Ahmedabad City in Gujarat, India. These women worked 
as head loaders, carrying clothes to and from the wholesale market. 
They were paid on a per-trip basis, regardless of the distance they 
traveled or the weight they carried. Often, they were not paid the 
full  amount  they  were  owed  because  no  records  were  kept.  Ela 
Bhatt, head of the Women’s Wing of the Textile Labor Association, 
helped organize the group and negotiate with the cloth merchants 
to gain fair treatment.

SEWA  is  now  a  member  of  the  International  Confederation  of 
Trade Unions and has become a model for associations of informal 
workers  internationally.  In  2011,  SEWA  had  more  than  1.3  million 
members across India, of which over 820,000 were in Gujarat, while 
the rest were in eight other states. The members are drawn from 
multiple  trades  and  occupations  and  from  all  religious  and  caste 
groups.

SEWA stresses self-reliance and promotes organizing around the 
central  strategies  of  work  security,  income  security,  food  security, 
and social security. Primarily a trade union, SEWA now engages in  
a  wide  range  of  other  areas,  including  leadership  development,  
collective  bargaining,  policy  advocacy,  financial  services  (savings, 

loans,  and  insurance),  social  services,  infrastructure,  and  training 
and capacity building.

Of particular concern to SEWA is the fact that the working poor, 
especially women, do not have a voice in institutions that set the 
rules that affect them. The association seeks to expand the voice of 
its members at the local level through representation and by build-
ing capacity to participate in local councils; municipal, state, and 
national  planning  bodies;  tripartite  boards;  minimum  wage  and 
other  advisory  boards;  sector-specific  business  associations;  and 
local, state, and national labor federations.

Over  the  past  decade,  SEWA  has  also  inspired  or  cofounded 
national and regional networks of home-workers in other parts of 
South  and  Southeast  Asia,  national  networks  of  street  vendors  in 
India  and  Kenya,  and  international  networks  of  domestic  workers 
and waste pickers. While some of these networks and organizations 
remain  weak,  most  have  been  able  to  collaborate,  leverage  re -
sources, and influence policies. The regional and international net-
works  of  domestic  workers,  home-based  workers,  street  vendors, 
and waste pickers have secured two international conventions (for 
home-workers  and  domestic  workers)  and  policies,  laws,  or  legal 
judgments in several countries.

and the workplace in the United States finds that 
cross-cutting interactions at work lead to greater 
awareness of the rationales for views other than 
one’s own and for “exposing people to political 
dialogue across lines of political difference.”33 In 
a survey of 200 managers, owners, and sales rep-
resentatives in Trinidad and Tobago, 81 percent 
of the interviewees reported that their working 
lives brought them into contact with people of a 
wider range of races than did their social lives.34
Interactions through jobs can contribute to 
greater  trust  and  positive  interdependence  be-
tween groups. In the 18th century, Montesquieu 
wrote that “the natural effect of commerce is to 
bring peace. Two nations that negotiate between 
themselves  become  reciprocally  dependent,  if 
one has an interest in buying and the other in 
selling.”35 Relations through jobs, whether built 
through trade or other transactions, can influ-
ence social relations.

A  2001  study  of  multiethnic  cities  in  India 
suggests  that  economic  interdependence,  in-
cluding through jobs, can reduce the incentives  
for violence between communities.36 Cities with 
more  interlinked  economic  relations  were  less 

likely to witness ethnic violence, while riots were 
more frequent in cities with fewer economic ties. 
The existence of civil society organizations, such 
as clubs, political parties, labor unions, and busi-
ness  associations,  contributed  to  reducing  vio-
lence.  But  economic  interests  provided  a  com-
mon  motivation  for  community  members  of 
both groups to participate in these associations.37
Jobs  can  also  play  a  connecting  role  out-
side  of  urban  environments.  Studies  in  Ghana 
and  Uganda  illustrate  how  farmers  connected 
through  networks  can  access  information  and 
increase productivity. In Ghana, pineapple farm-
ers  adjusted  their  use  of  fertilizer  in  response  
to the successful or unsuccessful experiences of 
their  neighbors.  Farmers  who  were  starting  to 
cultivate  pineapples  were  more  likely  to  make 
changes based on information they had received 
from other farmers, showing the potential that 
on-the-job interactions and learning from oth-
ers can have.38 In a qualitative survey, youth in 
Ghana who were asked about the characteristics 
that  would  make  a  job  attractive  emphasized 
the importance of jobs as opportunities to meet 
new people and build social networks.39

BOX 4.6   Some jobs connect people across ethnic boundaries

Surveys carried out across the world illustrate the ways jobs can connect 
people from different backgrounds.

“In Sadakhlo market in Georgia, next to the borders with Armenia 
and  Azerbaijan,  one  does  not  hear  the  virulent  expressions  of 
mutual  hatred  one  can  hear  a  few  miles  away  across  the  border. 
‘They fight, we don’t,’ says Mukhta, a trader from Azerbaijan, while 
putting his arm round his Armenian colleague Ashot.”a

“According to one of the stallholders at Ergneti market, on the 
disputed  border  between  South  Ossetia  and  mainland  Georgia, 
‘There are no political questions here. The market has one language: 
economic. That is it.’”b

“In Guinea, members of the Malinke ethnic group are wholesal-
ers in the groundnut market chain, while the primary producers of 
groundnuts  tend  to  be  Guerse.  Malinke  wholesalers  and  Guerse 
farmers  are  willing  to  trade  with  each  other.  This  is  helping  over-
come ethnic and religious tensions. . . . This willingness to trade is 
due to the mutually recognized possibility of profit.”c

“In  Burma,  as  in  Java,  probably  the  first  thing  that  strikes  the 
 visitor is the medley of peoples—European, Chinese, Indians, and 

native. It is, in the strictest sense, a medley, for they mix but do not 
combine. Each group holds to its own religion, its own culture and 
language, its own ideas and ways. As individuals they meet . . . in the 
market place, in buying and selling.”d

In  ancient  Cordoba,  Spain,  the  marketplace  represented  “the 
place  of  encounter  over  and  above  the  gender,  tribal,  and  faith 
divides that constituted Islamic urbanization.”e

“You don’t reconcile in a vacuum. There must be a practical pro-
gramme; there must be something that brings people together. As 
they work together, cleaning the coffee, they talk together so they 
start talking business but later they start talking family affairs. It fos-
ters relationships and reconciliation.” f

“If I wasn’t in this job, I might have only Indian friends or African 
friends,” said a sales manager for a processed food manufacturer in 
Trinidad and Tobago. “But now I have plenty, plenty friends. White 
friends in Mayaro. Chinese friends in Port-of-Spain. And real close. 
Closer  than  if  you  born  with  someone,  your  next-door  neighbor. 
And that’s why I wouldn’t swap this job for anything else.”g

An  experiment  among  farmers  in  rural 
Uganda found that subsistence cotton farmers 
using social networks can change existing social 
interactions  with  beneficial  results.  The  ran-
domized intervention compared the impact of 
training  on  agricultural  productivity  with  the 
impact  of  being  paired  with  another  farmer. 
The  pairs  were  encouraged  to  discuss  farming 
activities, problems, and solutions and to set a 
target for increases in cultivation. The interven-
tion encouraged exchanges of information and 
learning by expanding farmer networks. Farm-
ers  who  participated  in  the  project,  especially 
women,  significantly  increased  their  produc-
tivity. Connecting farmers with people outside 
their established social circles helped spread in-
formation that would not otherwise have been 
shared.40

Jobs  may  not  always  help  overcome  differ-
ences  and  tensions  between  groups.  While  in-
centives  inherent  in  jobs  can  provide  people 
with  motives  to  interact  across  gender,  caste, 
and ethnic boundaries, these incentives may not 

be sufficient to build trust or change behaviors 
and contribute to social cohesion. The literature 
on prejudice suggests that contact across groups 
can alter people’s perceptions of others.41 There 
may  also  be  risks.  If  cooperation  through  jobs 
fails,  tensions  between  groups  may  flare,  par-
ticularly  if  the  groups  have  previously  been  in 
conflict and blame each other.42

While  networks  connect  people  in  positive 
ways,  they  can  also  exclude.  Surveys  in  indus-
trial and developing countries consistently find 
that people obtain jobs through acquaintances. 
Yet,  reliance  on  networks  may  have  negative 
social  consequences  if  people  and  groups  who 
lack such connections are left out. In Morocco, 
after controlling for education, social status, and 
other factors, people whose fathers did not have 
formal sector jobs were significantly less likely to 
obtain formal sector jobs themselves.43 In addi-
tion to unfairness in access to jobs, family con-
nections can also influence labor earnings. For 
example, in Brazil, sons’ wages are influenced by 
those of their parents.44 

 

Jobs and social cohesion   

137

The exclusionary nature of networks is high-
lighted  by  the  experience  of  migrants  moving 
from rural areas to cities. Migrants often choose 
destinations  where  they  have  connections.  But 
if they do not, they can be uprooted from fam-
ily and community ties that provide economic 
and  social  support,  including  access  to  jobs. 
They may also lack the information needed to 
integrate into their new destinations. Migrants 
moving across borders or regions, internally dis-
placed persons or refugees fleeing from conflict 
or  returning  after  a  peace  agreement,  and  sol-
diers demobilized after conflict may be particu-
larly vulnerable to exclusion from job opportu-
nities. This is a concern in conflict situations as 
well as in contexts of structural transformation, 
when  massive  numbers  of  people  move  from 
rural  to  urban  areas.45  Networks  also  do  not 
reach many among the self-employed, especially 
home-based workers who work in isolation and 
domestic workers who lack opportunities to in-
teract with others.

Jobs influence aspirations and 
expectations

The various ways in which jobs are distributed 
can affect expectations and aspirations and in-
fluence whether people believe that they have a 
stake in society. The jobs that other people have 
can  contribute  to  an  individual’s  values,  atti-
tudes, and behaviors. Children’s goals for the fu-
ture may be influenced by whether their parents 
have jobs or not, as well as by the types of jobs 
their  parents  have.  Frustration  and  even  social 
unrest may develop when education and effort 
are  not  rewarded  or  when  people  perceive  the 
distribution of jobs to be unfair. 

The  Arab  Spring  was  as  much  or  more 
about  political  voice  as  it  was  about  jobs.  Yet 
widespread  disappointment,  especially  among 
youth, about the lack of job opportunities and 
frustration with the allocation of jobs based on 
connections  rather  than  merit  echoed  across 
countries. A young person in Egypt commented, 
“To work in a big company, you’ve got to have 
wasta [connections; literally, a middleman]. Re-
gardless of your qualifications, you must search 
for someone to secure the job for you. In some 
cases,  you  have  to  pay  money.”46 Social  assess-
ments  in  the  Republic  of  Yemen  documented 
frustration with the allocation of jobs based on 
tribal,  family  background,  or  party  affiliation. 

Respondents  at  a  focus  group  explained  that, 
“to  get  jobs,  one  needs  someone  to  speak  for 
him, particularly from Sana’a.” Young people re-
ported that inheriting a civil service post from 
one’s father was not viewed as wrong under the 
country’s civil service rules.47 

Jobs that are allocated based on connections 
and  other  circumstances  beyond  the  control  
of  an  individual  can  influence  whether  people 
view  society  as  fair.  Recent  work  on  the  mea-
surement of inequality of opportunities exam-
ines the extent to which access to basic services 
that are essential for human development, such 
as  education,  health,  nutrition,  and  sanitation,  
is based on circumstances of birth or arises be-
cause  of  inequality  within  society  (box  4.7).48 
Application  of  this  approach  to  access  to  jobs 
considers the extent to which opportunities are 
related to circumstances at birth, including gen-
der,  ethnicity,  and  parental  educational  attain-
ment  and  political  affiliation,  or  to  attributes, 
including educational attainment and age.49 Re-
sults from 29 countries in Europe and Central 
Asia indicate that inequality across groups based 
on circumstances and attributes varies between 
3 and 20 percent. The share of inequality attrib-
utable  to  circumstances  is  substantial  in  most 
cases,  contributing  to  more  than  half  of  the 
overall inequality (figure 4.5).

Circumstances at birth contribute the most 
to  inequality  in  Azerbaijan,  followed  by  Uz-
bekistan, Georgia, Turkey and Albania. In these 
countries,  such  factors  contribute  the  most  to 
inequality in access to jobs. Education plays an 
outsized role in inequality in some countries—
Armenia stands out in particular, along with Al-
bania, Bulgaria, and Romania. 

Similar  analysis  for  18  countries  in  Latin 
America  using  the  1990  Latinobarómetro  sur-
vey confirms these findings. On the whole, the 
education of the worker and the circumstances 
he  or  she  was  born  into  play  important  roles 
in explaining inequalities in access to jobs, and 
the role of education is especially important for 
regular employment in the formal sector.50

The interaction of jobs and social cohesion is not 
linear or simple to disentangle. This is an emerg-
ing area for further research across disciplines. 
The effect of jobs on trust and civic engagement 
at  the  individual  level  suggests  that  exchanges

BOX 4.7    Measuring inequality of opportunities in access to jobs 

The approach
The concept of equality of opportunity, which can be traced back to 
John Rawls and Robert Nozick,a stems from the idea that an individ-
ual’s  chances  of  success  in  life  should  not  be  caused  by  circum-
stances  that  are  beyond  the  individual’s  control,  such  as  gender, 
ethnicity,  location  of  birth,  or  family  background.  John  Roemer’s 
1998 work formalized the principle of equality of opportunity and 
argued that policy should seek to equalize opportunities indepen-
dent of circumstances.b Empirical applications of this concept use 
different measures of opportunity and estimate the extent to which 
inequality arises because of circumstances at birth, rather than indi-
vidual attributes such as effort or talent.c 

The  Human  Opportunity  Index  (HOI)  is  one  approach  that  is 
being used across countries and regions to analyze the opportuni-
ties available to children in terms of access to basic goods and ser-
vices such as sanitation, clean water, electricity, and basic education.d 
The HOI captures both the extent to which societies provide these 
goods and services and how equitably access to them is distributed 
among groups with different circumstances in a society.

Recent work has tested the application of the HOI methodology 
to  jobs  in  Europe  and  Central  Asia  and  Latin  America  using  data 
from  the  2006  Life  in  Transition  Survey  and  the  Latinobarómetro 
Survey.e In this case, opportunity is defined as having a job involving 
more than 20 hours of work a week; circumstances are the gender of 
the  individual,  the  educational  attainment  of  the  father,  parents’ 
past affiliation in the Communist Party (in Europe and Central Asia), 
and  self-reported  minority  status;  and  attributes  are  educational 
attainment and age. Those lacking opportunity are people working 
fewer than 20 hours a week, the unemployed, and those who want 
to work more.

The  HOI  is  the  coverage  rate  of  the  opportunity,  adjusted  for 
inequality between groups defined by circumstances and attributes. 
Inequality  is  measured  by  a  “dissimilarity  index”  (henceforth,  D), 
which reflects the share of available opportunities that would have 
to be reallocated to achieve the same coverage rate of opportunity 
across all groups. A decomposition of D indicates how much circum-
stances  contribute  to  inequality  between  groups  (relative  to  attri-

butes), and which circumstances contribute the most. Circumstances 
can affect access to a job involving more than 20 hours of work a 
week through direct and indirect channels. An example of a direct 
channel is when belonging to a minority group can affect the chance 
of getting a job. As for indirect channels, circumstances can influ-
ence the education of a person, which, in turn, influence the chance 
of  getting  a  job.  The  decomposition  of  D  is  intended  to  measure  
the direct channel, which is to say the inequality attributable to the 
predetermined circumstances, net of the effect attributed to differ-
ences in education and experience among workers.f 

Caveats
A number of questions complicate the exercise and act as caveats to 
the analysis. First, how should opportunity be defined in terms of 
access  to  jobs?  People  have  different  preferences  about  jobs,  so 
part  of  the  measured  inequality  may  reflect  voluntary  choices 
rather than a lack of access. And people with certain circumstances 
and attributes may be more (or less) likely to be in the labor force in 
the first place. Second, which circumstances should be considered? 
The data only report a limited range of them, and some may simply 
not be observable. Gender, minority status, and parental education 
are  commonly  considered  in  the  literature;  and  whether  parents 
were affiliated with the Communist Party can be a proxy for social 
status  in  the  European  and  Central  Asian  countries,  even  many 
years  later.  However,  parental  education  may  be  correlated  with 
unobserved abilities of an individual. Controlling for the individual’s 
education level partially resolves this problem but does not address 
the possibility that among children who receive the same educa-
tion, children with educated parents may acquire better skills stem-
ming  from  unobservable  inputs.  The  methodology  makes  no 
assumptions about missing circumstances, which are likely to exist 
since  information  on  all  circumstances  is  not  typically  available 
from the same survey. The inequality or dissimilarity index has the 
property  that  the  index  will  always  increase  with  the  addition  of 
more  circumstances  or  attributes.  Despite  these  caveats,  this 
approach  is  a  first  step  in  applying  the  inequality  of  opportunity 
analysis to access to jobs.

f.   Estimating the indirect channel—the effect of circumstances through education—would be difficult because education depends on a host of factors other than the circum-

stances on which information is available. Moreover, excluding the impact of circumstances through education is justified because we are interested in measuring the extent to 
which inequality in access to jobs is attributable to circumstances. While circumstances may have influenced educational attainment as well, these effects would have occurred 
at a much earlier stage of life (primarily in childhood) and therefore do not reflect inequality of opportunities specific to jobs.

they manage tensions between groups and col-
lective  decision  making.  But  some  jobs  may 

contribute more to social cohesion than others.

have a job but whether the job and its charac-
teristics  can  contribute  to  social  cohesion.  In

to contribute to social cohesion.

QUeStION 4 Can policies contribute to social cohesion?

In Rabat, Morocco, unemployed college gradu-
ates gather daily in front of government build-
ings to protest the lack of jobs.51 In Juba, South 
Sudan, the fledgling government faces the chal-
lenge of demobilizing 150,000 combatants and 
reintegrating  large  numbers  of  internally  dis-
placed persons after conflict.52 For policy mak-
ers in countries with high youth unemployment 
and in countries affected by conflict, expanding 
job opportunities has urgency for social and po-
litical reasons, as well as for economic reasons.

In industrial and developing countries alike, 
the conventional wisdom is that having a job is 
what matters for social cohesion—how societies 
peacefully  manage  collective  decision  making. 
The idea that jobs can build identity, or might 
be  associated  with  trust  or  more  participation 
in  society,  is  often  seen  as  relevant  only  for  a 
narrow  set  of  occupations  in  rich  countries. 
Those jobs are perceived as a luxury that devel-
oping countries cannot afford. Even those who 
concede that some jobs can do more for social 
cohesion  in  developing  countries  are  skeptical 
that  policies  can  do  much  beyond  supporting 
job creation. Given that most employment is in 
the private sector, it is unclear how or whether 
the  government  could  influence  the  nature  of 
the  jobs.  Some  even  doubt  that  jobs  on  their 
own lead to greater social cohesion. They view 
jobs as only one element that can contribute to 
changing values, attitudes, and behaviors within 
a complex web of institutional, historical, politi-
cal, and social factors. Given this multiplicity of 
influences, engineering social cohesion through 
jobs is not an option. 

Negative  experiences  with  publicly  funded 
employment  programs  give  some  justification 
to this skepticism. Temporary employment pro-
grams that place people into dead-end jobs with 
no  hope  for  future  employment  may  do  more 
harm  than  good.53  Similarly,  demobilization 
programs in post-conflict environments risk ex-
acerbating tensions between former opponents 
through  divisive  targeting.54  Social  cohesion 
is  actually  undermined  when  jobs  in  publicly 
funded  programs  are  allocated  to  friends  and 
relatives  of  government  officials,  or  when  the 

programs themselves are subject to corruption 
and  governance  risks.  These  negative  experi-
ences may reveal poor program design, however, 
rather than prove the impossibility for jobs poli-
cies to contribute to social cohesion. 

Access to information, rights, and voice

Policies can take social cohesion into account by 
expanding  opportunities  for  groups  who  face 
barriers  to  getting  jobs  and  increasing  access 
to  voice  and  rights.  People  may  feel  frustrated 
if  they  perceive  that  jobs  are  allocated  on  the 
basis  of  privilege  and  connections  rather  than 
merit and achievement. Increasing fairness and 
equality  of  opportunity  for  jobs  involves  in-
forming  the  public  about  jobs  and  how  to  get 
them, and about the existence of legal mecha-
nisms,  such  as  antidiscrimination  laws  and  af-
firmative action programs to reduce discrimina-
tion  and  support  the  inclusion  of  groups  who 
lack  access.  But  having  laws  on  the  books  is  
not enough. Increasing fairness involves institu-
tions for enforcement, and redress mechanisms 
for accountability. Although such measures can 
be  motivated  by  multiple  objectives,  including 
poverty reduction, they can also be considered 
from a social cohesion perspective.

Transparency  and  access  to  information 
about  jobs  can  increase  fairness  and  equality 
of  opportunity  by  ensuring  that  vacancies  are 
widely  publicized,  together  with  information 
about  accessing  public  employment  programs. 
Access  to  information  about  rights  is  similarly 
important for ensuring that labor practices are 
fair. Farmers, self-employed workers, and work-
ers without formal labor contracts are often not 
knowledgeable about their rights in relation to 
land owners, traders, local authorities, and em-
ployers, or about their options for appeals. Civil 
society organizations such as cooperatives, asso-
ciations of informal workers, and trade unions 
can  disseminate  information  about  rights  and 
the channels to voice grievances.55 

A related challenge is the extension of effec-
tive legal protection to those who work outside 
of legal frameworks. At the international level, 

 

Jobs and social cohesion   

141

the passage of ILO conventions on domestic and 
home workers has extended coverage for these 
groups (box 4.8). At the national level, countries 
such as Zambia and the Philippines include le-
gal protections of informal workers in domestic 
legislation.  Brazil  recognizes  domestic  workers 
within its constitution and has extended social 
protection, including leave and maternity ben-
efits to them. The country’s National Social Se-
curity Institute provides incentives for employ-
ers  who  register  domestic  workers.  Although 
difficult to enforce in practice, Brazil, the Czech 
Republic,  the  Philippines,  and  South  Africa 
have established minimum wages for domestic 
workers.56

Similarly,  migrant  workers  tend  to  fall  out-
side legal frameworks. Both sending and receiv-
ing countries can adopt measures to extend legal 
protection. The government of the Philippines 
has a mechanism to protect its overseas work-
ers.  The  government  provides  them  with  pre-
departure information and support services; it 
has also signed bilateral agreements and memo-
randa  of  understanding  recognizing  migrant 
workers’  rights  with  receiving  countries.  The 
government has also promoted voluntary social 
security schemes for overseas workers.57

The existence and quality of institutions for 
accountability can influence the extent to which 
rights  are  enforced  in  practice.58  Legal  frame-
works rely on the ability of labor ministries, in-
spectorates, and courts to handle disputes and 
hold the parties accountable. Most countries al-
low labor disputes to be heard in special labor 
courts  or  civil  courts.  But  court  proceedings 
can be lengthy, costly, and cumbersome. In re-
sponse, some countries have established alterna-
tive procedures for dispute resolution, including 
conciliation,  mediation,  and  arbitration  before 
court hearings.59 Cambodia introduced an Ar-
bitration Council in 2003 to help manage labor 
grievances  and  improve  industrial  relations  in 
the growing garment sector (box 4.9).

Antidiscrimination policies

Legal  mechanisms  such  as  antidiscrimina-
tion laws and provisions for affirmative action 
can  facilitate  access  to  jobs  for  groups  who  
are excluded from opportunities or suffer from 
stigma. Most countries have equality guarantees 
within  their  constitutions,  generally  covering 

BOX 4.8    Domestic workers: The journey to an ILO 

convention

Domestic  work  includes  cleaning,  cooking,  gardening,  child  care,  and  elder 
care. The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that there are 52.6 
million domestic workers worldwide; other estimates are nearly twice as high. 
Women, generally from the poorest sections of society, make up over 80 per-
cent  of  domestic  workers.a  Many  are  migrants,  and  child  labor  is  common, 
especially  for  girls.  Domestic  workers,  and  especially  migrants,  are  excluded 
from labor and social protection laws in most countries. 

Domestic  workers  have  long  tried  to  be  recognized  and  included  in  the 
labor laws of their respective countries. In 2006, domestic worker organizations 
began  to  organize  internationally  with  the  support  of  international  trade 
unions  and  nongovernmental  organizations  representing  informal  workers. 
Their main demand was recognition and access to rights, including a campaign 
for an ILO convention on labor rights for domestic workers.

The  campaign  involved  extensive  coordination  at  the  country  level  to 
mobilize  workers  and  gain  support  from  labor  ministries,  trade  unions,  and 
employers’ associations. As a result of this campaign, the minimum wage for 
domestic workers was raised by 10 percent in Jamaica, and a memorandum of 
understanding was signed to improve the conditions of Indonesian domestic 
workers in Malaysia.

In 2011, the ILO adopted the Domestic Workers Convention and the Domes-
tic Workers Recommendation. The convention states that domestic workers are 
to  be  covered  under  national  labor  laws  and  regulations,  including  those 
related to social protection programs. 

The  process  of  securing  an  ILO  convention  contributed  to  building  the 
capacity of organizations and individual leaders and gained domestic workers 
associations status with trade unions. It also created better conditions for rec-
ognition and enforcement of rights. In March 2012, the government of Singa-
pore announced that it would require employers to give one day a week off to 
the country’s 206,000 domestic workers, most of whom come from Indonesia, 
the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and India.b

the obligations of the state. Guarantees are of-
ten complemented by laws addressing job seg-
regation, unequal pay, prejudice in recruitment, 
harassment at work, and lack of education and 
training.60 Affirmative action programs involve 
proactive measures for hiring women, minori-
ties,  and  other  groups  subject  to  exclusion.61 
Such programs can be mandatory or voluntary 
and apply to the public or private sectors.

Affirmative  action  programs  can  work,  but 
pitfalls  are  many.  Evaluations  yield  mixed  re-
sults.62 The most extensive research is from the 
United  States;  it  finds  that  programs  are  most 
 effective  when  they  are  temporary  and  com-
bined with improvements in recruitment, train-

BOX 4.9    From laws on the books to laws in action in 

Cambodia’s garment sector

The garment industry is Cambodia’s largest formal sector employer. By mid-
2008, the sector had more than 300 factories, with nearly 340,000 workers, 90 
percent of whom were women. Labor conditions including low wages, exces-
sive overtime, poor occupational health and safety, child labor, and antiunion 
practices emerged as a major issue as the sector expanded. The initial response 
was passage of a new labor law in 1997. Enforcement was poor, however. The 
Labor Inspectorate lacked credibility; inspectors were underpaid and underre-
sourced, and were seen as subject to influence. The courts were perceived as 
corrupt and unresponsive to the needs of workers or employers. As a result, 
strikes and demonstrations increased, and major international brands raised 
concerns about the viability of operating in Cambodia.

In this context, Cambodia concluded a 1999 bilateral trade agreement with 
the United States. Building on a similar clause in other trade deals, the United 
States agreed to increase Cambodia’s import quota for garments if a semian-
nual  review  showed  that  progress  had  been  achieved  in  adherence  to  core 
international labor standards and standards set in Cambodian law. Following 
the agreement, the United States funded two International Labour Organiza-
tion (ILO) projects to support the implementation of this clause. The first, which 
became  known  as  Better  Factories  Cambodia,  involved  monitoring  working 
conditions in garment factories.

The  second  program  established  an  Arbitration  Council  to  prevent  and 
resolve labor disputes. The council’s 30 part-time members were nominated 
through a process facilitated by the ILO and endorsed by unions, employers’ 
organizations, and government. The council conducts mandatory but (gener-
ally) nonbinding arbitration of collective labor disputes that cannot be resolved 
through  mediation  by  the  Ministry  of  Labor.  Most  disputes  handled  by  the 
council involve compliance with labor law related to wages, bonuses, benefits, 
and working conditions. Some cases also relate to rights, including antiunion 
practices, gender equality, freedom of association, and collective bargaining.

Since its establishment in 2003, the council has heard more than 1,200 dis-
putes, 70 percent of which  are reported as successfully resolved. Opinion sur-
veys  indicate  a  high  level  of  confidence  in  the  council’s  independence  and 
effectiveness.  In  2010,  the  Garment  Manufacturers  Association  of  Cambodia 
and major union federations agreed to switch to the council’s arbitration pro-
cedures for disputes over existing labor rights. The result has been an upsurge 
in the rate of awards issued by the council and a decrease in the rate at which 
parties are filing objections. Strikes per factory have fallen to their lowest level 
in 10 years.

ing,  and  on-the-job  training.63  Evidence  from 
developing countries is more limited. In South 
Africa,  affirmative  action  supporting  blacks, 
women, and people with disabilities was com-
plemented  with  incentives  for  firms,  including 
access  to  licenses  and  contracts. An  evaluation 
found  that  programs  had  limited  impact  on 
reducing  gaps  in  employment  and  wages  but 
narrowed  differentials  at  the  top  of  the  wage 
distribution. This finding suggests that the pro-

gram might have assisted individuals who were 
already higher up on the skills ladder but not the 
average previously disadvantaged individual.64 

Hiring  quotas  for  underrepresented  groups 
can be enshrined in constitutions, as is the case 
for Scheduled Castes and Tribes in India and for 
Bumiputras  in  Malaysia.  Both  countries  have 
shown  that  quotas  work  well  but  can  become 
politicized.65 Quotas supported through specific 
programs have been successful. In Bangladesh, 
for instance, where women’s employment rates 
were  extremely  low,  the  Employment  Gen-
eration  Program  for  the  Poorest  put  in  place 
a  30  percent  quota  for  women.  This  doubled 
women’s participation in the program within a 
year, with participants reporting a high level of 
satisfaction.66

Jobs policies can shape social identity and 
connect people

Access to jobs can bolster self-esteem and pro-
duce  benefits  for  societies  beyond  incomes. 
Programs that support employment for at-risk 
populations, including youth, can take into ac-
count the ways in which jobs affect peoples’ at-
titudes, values, and behaviors and contribute to 
improved  relations  between  groups.  Arguably, 
in  countries  with  high  youth  unemployment, 
targeted  training  programs  have  the  potential 
to be designed to strengthen self-esteem, which 
can  lead  to  greater  community  involvement 
and reduced crime and violence. The evidence 
remains  limited  and  tentative,  but  emerging 
findings from some training programs targeted  
to  youth,  including  those  in  post-conflict  set-
tings are somewhat encouraging. 

The  Northern  Uganda  Social  Action  Fund 
suggests  that  combining  vocational  training, 
life skills, and counseling can increase commu-
nity involvement and reduce aggression among 
youth in a post-conflict setting (box 4.10).67 A 
reintegration  and  agricultural  livelihoods  pro-
gram for high-risk Liberian youth led to a mod-
est increase in social engagement and a reduc-
tion  in  illegal  activities.  Participants  were  also 
less interested in recruitment into violent activi-
ties in neighboring Côte d’Ivoire. The program 
had  no  clear  impact  on  reducing  aggression  
and  violence,  however.68  An  evaluation  of  the 
Juventud y Empleo program in the Dominican 
Republic  found  that  a  combination  of  voca-

tional  and  life-skills  training  for  unemployed 
youth can reduce involvement in gangs and de-
lay teen pregnancy.69 This is an area for further 
research; evidence is thin, and few evaluations of 
employment and training programs incorporate 
social cohesion outcome measures such as com-
munity participation and conflict resolution.

Temporary employment programs can pro-
vide  skills  training  and  access  to  employment 
for  youth  at  risk  and  vulnerable  populations, 
particularly  during  crises  and  after  conflicts.70 
These programs have a mixed record in support-
ing employability, because they generally involve 
jobs  with  low  status  that  rarely  lead  to  future 
earnings opportunities. But there are indications 
that programs can be designed to invest in skills 
with  benefits  for  social  cohesion.  El  Salvador’s 
Temporary  Income Assistance  Program  targets 
women  and  youth  in  areas  with  high  rates  of 
violence. Early results suggest that the program 
has increased the self-esteem of beneficiaries and 
reduced the recurrence of violence. 71

Public  works  programs  frequently  rely  on 
community participation to identify local proj-
ects,  providing  forums  for  collective  decision 
making.  Community  meetings  can  bring  to-
gether people affected by conflict and crisis (box 
4.10).  In  Rwanda,  meetings  for  the  country’s 
public works program discussed peace building, 
security,  community  development,  and  recon-
ciliation, in addition to project-related issues. In 
the Republic of Yemen, fuel shortages and price 
increases  in  building  materials  stalled  public 
works  activities  in  2011.  However,  communi-
ties worked together to find creative solutions to 
these  obstacles,  including  using  local  materials 
and finding alternative modes of transport.72 

Participatory aspects of programs can pro-
vide a channel for voice of excluded groups. In 
a  survey  of  participants  in  Ethiopia’s  Produc-
tive Safety Net Program—which at 7.6 million 
beneficiaries is one of the largest public works 
programs in the world—two-thirds of respon-
dents said that the project had given them the 
first opportunity ever to be involved in a local 
meeting. Many participants had not interacted 
with  local  government  officials  prior  to  the 
program.73 

Employment programs partnering with the 
private sector can connect people through jobs.

Opportunities for youth in Northern Uganda
Two decades of insurgency, instability, and conflict led to high rates of poverty 
in northern Uganda. By 2005, a measure of peace and stability had returned to 
the region, allowing for the demobilization and reintegration of former com-
batants and other war-affected populations. In 2006, the government launched 
the Youth Opportunities Program to stimulate income generation and employ-
ment growth among young adults ages 16 to 35. The program provided cash 
grants for vocational training and business materials to groups of participants 
with successful grant proposals. Groups had an average of 22 members, and 
most  expressed  interest  in  tailoring,  carpentry,  metal  works,  mechanics,  or 
hairdressing.

An evaluation two years after the intervention found increased investments 
in  skills,  participation  in  skilled  work,  greater  incomes,  and  higher  savings. 
Grantees  were  4  percent  more  likely  to  attend  community  meetings  and  9 
 percent  more  likely  to  be  community  mobilizers.  Participants  also  reported 
receiving more social support from their family and the community. Further-
more, men who received grants reported a 31 percent decline in aggressive 
behavior relative to the control group. This finding is consistent with theories 
that link aggression to stress levels, low social standing, and perceived injus-
tice—all potentially alleviated by higher employment and incomes.

Public works in Sri Lanka’s Northern Province
In Sri Lanka, a cash-for-work program initially established to re settle 100,000 
returnees  following  internal  conflict  actually  assisted  more  than  250,000 
returnees and quickly evolved into one of the largest sources of employment in 
the Northern Province. 

Participants noted that in many cases the program meetings were the first 
community-level gathering that they had attended after having arrived from 
camps  for  internally  displaced  populations.  By  many  accounts,  community 
meetings, shared meals, team work, and the involvement of elders and chil-
dren as indirect beneficiaries of the program promoted a sense of belonging 
among the newly resettled families.

Sachchithananthan  Subodhini,  36  years  old,  from  Thervipuram  in  the 
Puthukkudiyiruppu Division of the Northern Province said that she was “very 
happy. As a result of cash for work, the whole village is working as one; for our 
own  community  and  village.”  Reflecting  on  her  life  journey  since  being  dis-
placed in 1995, she said that the program “had helped to bring the community 
together. . . . [T]he village seemed abandoned but the shramadana [volunteer 
work] helped to get the community back to its original state.”

Development Report 2013 (Sri Lanka).

entrepreneurial skills. Students are mentored by 
professors and private sector coaches to develop 
business plans. The initial results of the program 
show that the program motivated students and 
gave them confidence to take risks. A male par-
ticipant from Tunis explained, “I have become 
more independent. My behavior has changed. I 
use my new skills, I am more disciplined.” Stu-

dents also explained that the program expanded 
their professional networks by giving them op-
portunities  to  interact  with  mentors.  “I  now 
have a social network. I know whom to consult,” 
explained a female participant.74

While  not  all  jobs  affect  social  cohesion, 
those that shape social identity, build networks, 
and  increase  fairness,  particularly  for  excluded 
groups, can defuse tensions. Increasing fairness 
in the allocation of jobs and at work can also be 
important  for  social  cohesion.  Measures  that 
support  inclusion,  extend  access  to  voice  and 
rights, and improve transparency and account-

ability in the labor market can improve equity. 
They  can  also  increase  the  extent  to  which 
people perceive that they have a stake in society. 
This perception can be especially critical when 
risks of social unrest from youth unemployment 
and conflict are high. While policies with weak 
governance or divisive targeting can undermine 
social  cohesion,  well-designed  programs  may 
have  positive  effects.  Jobs  policies  for  youth  at 
risk can incorporate counseling and training in 
conflict resolution. Public works programs can 
facilitate community participation and engage-
ment between citizens and local governments.

Survey (database), Rand Corporation, Santa Mon-

IFLS.html.  The  community  activities  recorded 
covered  participation  in  a  community  meeting; 
cooperative, voluntary labor; neighborhood im-

provement; neighborhood watch (men); or wom-
en’s  association.  These  trends  were  likely  driven 
by a set of factors, including political changes after 
1998 that created more space for community dia-
logue and the decentralization of public services 
starting in 1999; the introduction of multistake-
holder  forums  for  consultation  on  budgeting 
(the Musrenbang) in 2004, which included village 
meetings;  school  based–management  initiatives 
that require parental involvement; and the scaling 
up of development programs that explicitly pro-
mote community participation.

14.  Giles,  Mavridis,  and  Witoelar  2012  for  the 
World Development Report 2013. Development 
and  antipoverty  programs  such  as  the  KDP  
(Kecamatan Development Project) and its urban 
counterpart, the UPP (Urban Poverty Program), 
explicitly  promoted  community  participation 
from their inception and continue to do so under 
the  new  and  expanded  umbrella  of  the  PNPM 
(National  Program  for  Community  Empower-
ment).  Other  poverty  programs  (including  the 
conditional  cash  transfer  program,  Program  
Keluarga  Harapan)  usually  have  some  commu-
nity participation component.

15.  These results are similar to findings from the Wis-
consin Longitudinal Study, which tracked nearly 
5,000 people who had graduated high school in 
1957 over 45 years and indicated that the loss of 
a job can lead to withdrawal from associational 
life. Getting laid off even once, especially if it oc-
curred during a person’s prime working years, re-
sulted in “enduring, substantively and statistically 
significant  lower  probabilities  of  social  involve-
ment over the life course,” particularly in church, 
youth,  and  community  groups.  See  Brand  and

PART2

What are good jobs  
for development?

Introduction to Part 2

Earnings, benefits (if any), and overall job 

satisfaction are what matter to individual 
jobholders.  Those  earnings  and  bene-
fits—tangible  or  otherwise—are  the  first  and 
most direct measure of the value a job has to so-
ciety. But jobs may also affect others, positively 
or negatively. Jobs for women may influence re-
source  allocations  at  the  household  level  and 
benefit their children. Jobs connected to world 
markets  may  lead  to  knowledge  spillovers  and 
make other workers more productive. Jobs that 
provide  opportunities  may  convey  a  sense  of 
fairness  to  others  and  help  them  remain  en-
gaged. Spillovers like these have been the focus 
of recent thinking on development. The analysis 
may be organized around concepts such as gen-
der, urbanization, or conflict; but much of the 
action happens through jobs.

Quite often individual and social perspectives 
on  jobs  coincide;  but  not  always.  For  instance, 
jobs  with  perks  and  benefits  may  be  highly  
coveted  by  individuals,  but  they  may  be  less  
valuable  to  society  if  their  privileges  are  sup-
ported through government transfers or restric-
tive  regulations,  undermining  the  earnings  or 
job  opportunities  of  others.  Because  of  gaps 
like these, jobs that look equivalent from an indi-
vidual perspective may be different from a social 
perspective. The contributions jobs make to so-
ciety should be assessed by taking into account 
the value they have to the people who hold them, 
but  also  the  potential  spillovers  on  others— 
positive or negative. Good jobs for development 
are those with the highest value to society.

Conversely,  some  forms  of  work  are  un-
equivocally  bad.  A  set  of  universal  rights  en-
dorsed  by  governments,  international  organi-
zations,  and  others  seeks  to  eliminate  forced 
labor, harmful forms of child labor, discrimi-

nation,  and  the  suppression  of  voice  among 
workers.  These  forms  of  work  should  not  be 
considered jobs.

How  jobs  contribute  to  living  standards, 
productivity,  and  social   cohesion  varies  with  
a country’s level of development, its demogra-
phy, its endowments, and its institutions. Jobs 
agendas  are  thus  inherently  country  specific.  
By combining the various features of an econ-
omy, however, it is possible to build a typology 
of jobs challenges. It includes agrarian econo-
mies,  conflict-affected  countries,  urbanizing 
countries, resource-rich countries, small island  
nations, countries with high youth unemploy-
ment, formalizing economies, and aging societ-
ies. Because the nature of the challenges varies, 
what makes a job good for development in one 
context may not be so relevant in another. And 
in  some  circumstances,  tradeoffs  emerge.  The 
jobs that do the most to defuse tension in the 
short term may not do much for productivity, 
or  those  with  the  highest  productivity  impact 
may not lead to a broad-based improvement in 
living standards. Identifying good jobs for de-
velopment helps visualize these tradeoffs.

Different  countries  face  different  jobs  chal-
lenges, but two forces—the migration of people 
and  the  migration  of  jobs—connect  their  jobs 
agendas.  These  two  flows  have  an  impact  on 
countries at the sending and the receiving ends. 
The  arrival  of  migrants  or  the  outsourcing  of 
jobs affects the living standards of both migrants 
and  locals.  The  availability  of  foreign  workers, 
the development of migrant networks channel-
ing savings and ideas, and the arrival of multi- 
national  firms  bringing  in  more  advanced  
techniques, are all bound to increase productiv-
ity. Family structures and community life are also 
affected by the movement of people and jobs.

Valuing jobs

Jobs are often assessed from an individual perspective. But they can also 
affect the earnings, productivity, and well-being of others—positively  
or negatively. These spillovers should be assessed too.

The most important impact of jobs is on 

the people who hold them. Jobs provide 
earnings, can give access to benefits and 
insurance, and are often a source of broader life 
satisfaction. Development, in large part, consists 
of  increasing  these  direct  effects  of  jobs  on 
individuals. 

Beyond  the  importance  of  jobs  for  those 
who  have  them,  jobs  matter  for  societies  be-
cause they can affect the earnings, employment 
opportunities, and the productivity of others, 
as well as the collective capacity to manage ten-
sions. Jobs can also contribute to shared social 
objectives, such as poverty reduction, environ-
mental  protection,  and  fairness.  Often,  the 
 individual and social values of jobs are similar; 
but these two perspectives may differ. For in-
stance,  Vietnam’s  poverty  rate  declined  with 
unprecedented  speed  in  the  1990s  when  land 
was  redistributed  to  farmers  and  agricultural 
commercialization  was  liberalized.1 Albeit  in-
creasing  individual  incomes,  farming  jobs  in-
volved difficult working conditions, substantial 
variability  in  earnings,  and  no  formal  social 
protection.  But  they  made  a  major  contribu-
tion  to  the  development  of Vietnam.  Bloated 
public utilities, on the other hand, often offer a 
range  of  privileges  to  their  employees  even 
when the utilities themselves provide only lim-
ited coverage of the population and unreliable 

services, and are obstacles to economic growth 
and poverty reduction. Such jobs may look ap-
pealing  from  an  individual  perspective—but 
less so from a social perspective. Good jobs for 
development are those that make the greatest 
contribution to society, taking into account the 
value they have to the people who hold them, 
but also their potential spillovers on others—
positive or negative. 

Recognizing  the  multiple  effects  of  jobs 
is  important  for  understanding  the  possible 
trade offs  they  entail.  Some  jobs  greatly  con-
tribute to productivity growth but do not lead 
to poverty reduction in the short run. In other 
cases, jobs are urgently needed to avoid an un-
raveling of social cohesion, but the job creation 
that can be immediately supported using pub-
lic funds is unlikely to result in rapid produc-
tivity growth. An understanding of the various 
effects  of  jobs  on  aggregate  well-being,  both 
direct  and  indirect,  may  help  identify  when  a 
virtuous circle of jobs along all three transfor-
mations  may  arise,  and  when  a  vicious  circle 
looms.

The value of a job for the person who holds it 
is a primary indication of its development pay-
off. But assessing the broader value the job has 
to society also requires information on the spill-
overs the job may have on the living standards 
of others, on aggregate productivity, or on social

cohesion. Data from household, plant-level, and 
values surveys, as well as qualitative assessments, 
can  be  used  to  determine  the  existence  of  rel-
evant  spillovers.  Although  quantifying  all  the 
gaps  between  the  individual  and  social  values 
of jobs may not be possible, identifying where 
these  gaps  lie  can  help  make  policy  trade offs 
transparent. The analytical tools to do so can be 
borrowed from several disciplines in economics 
and the social sciences. These disciplines often 
focus on spillovers from jobs, without necessar-
ily calling them that.

While  some  jobs  may  contribute  more  to 
development  than  their  individual  values  sug-
gest, some forms of work are likely bad from any 
point of view. All countries have subscribed to 
a set of universal rights. Most governments, as 
well  as  international  organizations  and  others, 
have  ratified  or  endorsed  standards  seeking  to 
eliminate  forced  labor,  harmful  forms  of  child 
labor,  discrimination,  and  the  suppression  of 
voice  among  workers.  Thus,  some  work  ac-
tivities  are  widely  viewed  as  unacceptable  and 
should not be treated as jobs.

Rights as the foundation

While  jobs  can  be  transformational,  some 
forms of work are harmful. Those that exploit 
workers,  expose  them  to  dangerous  environ-
ments,  or  threaten  their  physical  and  mental 
well-being are bad for individuals and societ-
ies.  Their  negative  effects  can  be  surprisingly 
long-lasting. An extreme example is the impact 
of  the  Atlantic  slave  trade  on  West  Africa.  A 
study  found  that  individuals  whose  ancestors 
had been threatened by slavery were less likely 
to trust relatives, neighbors, and local govern-
ments even more than 100 years after the end 
of the slave trade.2 Today, international norms 
of  human  rights  and  labor  standards  reject 
forced  labor,  harmful  forms  of  child  labor, 
discrimination,  and  the  suppression  of  voice 
among workers. Yet close to 21 million people 
globally are estimated to be victims of bonded 
labor,  slavery,  forced  prostitution,  and  other 
forms of involuntary work.3 In 2008, 115 mil-
lion children between the ages of 5 and 17 were 
involved in hazardous work (box 5.1).4 

BOX 5.1    Children do perilous work in artisanal gold mines in Mali

Much artisanal gold mining in Mali is village based and focused on 
alluvial deposits that require panning for separation. Although child 
labor tends to be relatively controlled in Mali, an estimated 20,000 
to 40,000 children, some as young as age 6, work in artisanal gold 
mining.a Human Rights Watch has documented the perilous nature 
of this work:

“They dig shafts and work underground, pull up, carry and crush 
the ore, and pan it for gold. Many children suffer serious pain in their 
heads, necks, arms, or backs, and risk long-term spinal injury from 
carrying heavy weights and from enduring repetitive motion. Chil-
dren have sustained injuries from falling rocks and sharp tools, and 
have fallen into shafts. In addition, they risk grave injury when work-
ing in unstable shafts, which sometimes collapse.”b

The work is toxic because miners use mercury to separate the 
gold from the rock. Mercury poisoning can cause serious neurologi-
cal  disorders,  vision  impairment,  headaches,  memory  loss,  and 
problems  with  concentration.  Often,  the  children  themselves  are 
aware of the dangers:

“It’s my stepmother who makes me work there. I don’t want to. 
My real mother left. My stepmother takes all the money they pay 
me. . . . I don’t get any money from the work. . . . Our work starts at  
8 a.m. and continues the whole day. . . . I take the minerals [ore] and 
pan them. I work with mercury, and touch it. . . . He said mercury was 
a  poison  and  we  shouldn’t  swallow  it,  but  he  didn’t  say  anything 
else about the mercury. . . . I don’t want to work in the mines. I want 
to stay in school. I got malaria, and I am very tired when I work there 
[at the mine].”

—Mariam D., estimated age 11, Worognan, Sikasso Region, 
April 8, 2011c

“It’s  dangerous—there  are  often  collapses.  People  are  injured. 
Three died in a cave-in. The little children don’t come down into the 
hole. . . . I have had problems since working there—my back hurts 
and I have problems urinating. No one says anything to me about 
safety.”

—Ibrahim K., age 15d

At  the  international  level,  the  United  Na-
tion’s  Universal  Declaration  of  Human  Rights 
of 1948 establishes that “everyone has the right 
to work, to free choice of employment, to just 
and favorable conditions of work and to protec-
tion  against  unemployment.”  These  rights  are 
further elaborated in international conventions 
and regional frameworks and are translated into 
domestic laws.5 The global agenda for workers’ 
rights  became  focused  on  four  fundamental 
principles and rights in the workplace in 1998. 
Back then, a vast majority of members of the In-
ternational  Labour   Organization  (ILO)  signed 
a declaration covering a core set of labor stan-
dards  on  the  elimination  of  forced  and  com-
pulsory  labor,  the  abolition  of  child  labor,  the 
elimination  of  discrimination  in  employment 
and occupation, and freedom of association and 
collective  bargaining.6  Other  ILO  conventions 
cover a range of related subjects including work-
ing time, social security, occupational safety and 
health, and labor inspections.7

International  law  requires  that  countries 
bring their domestic laws into compliance with 
the international legal instruments the countries 
have  ratified.  The  core  labor  standards  have  a 
special  status  among  ILO  conventions  because 
the  1998  declaration  requires  all  ILO  member 
states to “respect, promote, and realize” the stan-
dards, regardless of whether they ratify specific 
conventions.8 The standards influence other in-
struments for protecting workers’ rights through 
references  in  national  and  regional  legislation, 
the texts of many bilateral free trade agreements, 
the  procedures  of  international  organizations, 
and corporate codes of conduct.9 International 
legal  frameworks  arguably  do  not  cover  some 
fundamental  rights.  The  core  labor  standards, 
for  example,  do  not  directly  address  working 
conditions including safety and health.10

Gaps  remain  between  rights  on  paper  and 
implementation  in  practice  (box  5.2).  Even  in 
countries that have ratified the core labor stan-
dards and have laws on the books, children work 
in harmful conditions, discrimination happens 
in access to jobs and in pay, forced labor persists, 
and freedom of association is limited. Commit-
ments in treaties, conventions, and laws may not 
change the institutions, practices, and behaviors 
that  affect  workers’ rights on their  own. A key 
factor  driving  these  gaps  is  the  fact  that  many 
workers are not covered by laws. For example:

•   Many  labor  laws  and  regulations  cover  only 
workers  in  formal  employment  relation-
ships,  limiting  the  extent  to  which  workers 
can  appeal  to  legal  mechanisms.  The  grow-
ing  involvement  of  agencies  in  hiring  work-
ers  complicates  legal  accountability  because 
temporary workers often have contracts with 
employment  agencies,  which,  in  turn,  enter 
into the contracts with the actual employers. 
Often, such workers would not count against 
legal  minimum  employment  levels  at  which 
labor rights become binding. 11

•   Some labor laws deliberately exclude domes-
tic  workers,  family  workers,  or  workers  in 
small  enterprises.12  Exclusions  can  also  ap-
ply  in  export  zones  and  other  areas  where 
regulation is suspended to attract investment. 
Unpaid family workers in agriculture and en-
terprises, including children on family farms, 
may also be excluded. Many women perform 
non-remunerated work of this sort.13

•   Tensions  may  also  exist  between  labor  rights 
defined in national and international contexts 
and customary, religious, and indigenous laws. 
Many  countries  are  characterized  by  legal 
pluralism, whereby multiple legal systems ex-
ist side by side. Overlapping jurisdictions are 
most common in the case of family law relat-
ing to marriage, divorce, and inheritance.14 

Gaps  between  rights  on  paper  and  those 
in  practice  underscore  a  substantial  agenda  to 
eliminate unacceptable forms of work. Nonstate 
actors,  including  private  employers  and  civil  
society  organizations,  are  increasingly  involved 
in  efforts  to  improve  compliance  with  labor 
rights and standards. Multinational corporations 
and  industry  associations  often  adopt  codes  
of  conduct,  voluntary  standards,  and  monitor-
ing and auditing strategies.15 Nongovernmental 
organizations monitor factories and firms, pro-
vide training and education to workers, and co-
ordinate domestic and global campaigns. While 
this heightened involvement in rights and stan-
dards  does  not  guarantee  that  implementation 
will improve, it provides potential channels and 
partnerships  for  increasing  accountability  for 
rights at work.

BOX 5.2    Compliance with core labor standards is partial

The  number  of  countries  that  have  adopted  the  eight  core  labor 
standards included in the International Labour Organization’s 1998 
Declaration  of  the  Fundamental  Principles  and  Rights  at  Work  is 
steadily increasing. But compliance gaps with the four principles—
child labor, forced labor, discrimination, and freedom of association 
and collective bargaining—are still apparent.a

Child labor. ILO conventions 138 and 182 require countries to develop 
and monitor action plans regulating work by children under age 18. 
Convention  182,  covering  the  most  harmful  forms  of  child  labor,  
has been ratified by 175 countries. The largest numbers of children 
in hazardous work are in East Asia and the Pacific, but across regions 
there is evidence that progress is being made.b Brazil and India are 
among  the  countries  showing  improvements.  In  Brazil,  between 
1992 and 2008, employment among 7–15 year olds fell over 10 per-
centage  points,  from  18  percent  to  7  percent.  At  the  same  time, 
school  attendance  rose  from  85  percent  to  97  percent.  In  India, 
 children’s employment fell from 8 percent to nearly 4 percent, and 
school attendance rose 14 percentage points (from 72 percent to  
86 percent).c 

Forced labor. More countries have ratified conventions 29 and 105, 
the core standards on forced labor, than the other core standards. 
An estimated two-thirds of forced labor takes the form of economic 
exploitation; one-fifth is linked to forced labor imposed by the state 
or  the  military;  and  the  remainder  involves  commercial  sexual 
exploitation. This last form disproportionately affects women and 
girls.d The long-term effects on individuals, families, and communi-
ties can be severe. Nongovernmental organizations that rescue vic-
tims  of  forced  labor,  particularly  forced  commercial  prostitution, 
find that post-traumatic stress, social stigma, and disease can crip-
ple reentry into society.e

Discrimination. Conventions 100 and 111 refer to discrimination by 
gender, ethnicity, disability, or other status as a source of disparities 
in access to jobs, segregation within the labor market, pay gaps, and 
harassment or violence at work. From a legal perspective, discrimi-
nation can be understood as inequality before the law within either 
the formal legal system or customary law. It results from unequal 
treatment on the grounds of race, gender, religion, political opinion, 
national extraction, or social origin; or the unequal impact of poli-
cies, practices, or rules. Employment outcomes are affected by each 
of these layers of discrimination.f Although progress has been made 
in removing legal obstacles that affect women’s access to jobs, bar-
riers  remain.g  Labor  laws  in  44  countries  restrict  the  hours  that 
women  may  work,h  and  71  countries  impose  legal  limits  on  the 
industries in which women may work. Such restrictions have often 

deprived women of equal access to jobs. Inequality in laws relating 
to marriage, inheritance, and property ownership, as well as tradi-
tional and customary laws, also affect the access of women to pro-
ductive assets and business opportunities. 

Discrimination in employment may be the outcome of policies 
not dealing directly with labor issues. For example, in some coun-
tries of Central and Eastern Europe, Roma children are often tracked 
into schools intended for children with special needs, which provide 
limited  opportunities  for  further  advancement  in  education  and 
subsequent employment. Roma graduates of special schools in the 
Czech Republic were twice as likely as non-Roma graduates to be 
out of the labor force.i A study of Roma in the Czech Republic found 
that 19 percent of Roma ages 10–19 had attended a special needs 
school, while the share in the non-Roma population was 7 percent. 
The  figures  in  the  Slovak  Republic  were  12  and  8  percent 
respectively.j  A  2007  court  case  involving  Roma  students  in  the 
Czech  Republic  noted  that  they  were  more  likely  to  be  placed  in 
schools for the mentally challenged than non-Roma children. The 
European Court of Human Rights ruled that this overrepresentation 
violated nondiscrimination protections in the European Convention 
on Human Rights.k

Freedom  of  association  and  collective  bargaining  (FACB).  Although 
conventions 87 and 98 are among the oldest of the core standards, 
they have been ratified by fewer countries than the others. These 
conventions cover the right to establish and join organizations and 
call  for  mechanisms  for  negotiations  between  employers  and 
worker organizations. FACB are “enabling rights” in that they give 
workers voice to advocate for other aspects of working conditions, 
including safety and health.l

FACB is curtailed in countries where unions and other associa-
tions are banned, where associations face restrictions on their activ-
ity,  or  where  members  are  threatened  by  violence  or  repression. 
FACB rights of both workers and employers are monitored by the 
ILO Governing Body’s Committee on Freedom of Association (CFA), 
a  universal  monitoring  mechanism  that  functions  in  addition  to  
the  ILO’s  regular  supervisory  mechanisms  for  monitoring  ratified 
conventions. The CFA handles complaints related to civil liberties, 
including murder, abductions, disappearances, threats, arrests, and 
detentions  of  trade  union  leaders  and  members,  as  well  as  other 
acts  of  antiunion  harassment  and  intimidation  and  violations  of 
freedom  of  assembly  and  freedom  of  expression.m Convention  87 
protects  the  rights  of  all  workers,  including  the  self-employed.  In 
practice, however, implementation of FACB is limited because many 
workers are employed outside traditional employer-employee rela-
tionships or do not work in occupations or sectors that are covered 
by formal unions.

The value of jobs to individuals  
and society

The most obvious outcome of a job is the earn-
ings  it  provides  to  the  worker.  These  earnings 
can be in cash or in kind and may include a range 
of associated benefits. The earnings the job pro-
vides, as well as the output it generates, typically 
increase with the skills of the worker. Improv-
ing skills is thus one of the most direct channels  
to  enhance  the  value  jobs  have  to  individuals 
and  society  (question  5).  Other  characteristics 
of  the  job  may  also  matter  from  the  point  of 
view  of  individual  well-being.  Stability,  voice, 
and fulfillment at work all play a role in overall 
job satisfaction, as do any detrimental impacts 
of jobs on mental and physical health through 
stress and anxiety.16

Several of these dimensions of jobs have been 
combined into the concept of decent work intro-
duced by the ILO in 1999 (box 5.3). Since then, 
many  governments  have  used  it  to  articulate 
their policy agendas on jobs. The concept of de-
cent work has also been embraced by the United 
Nations and several international organizations 
and endorsed by numerous global forums.

A job may also matter for others, beyond its 
holder. When asked about their most preferred 
jobs,  survey  respondents  from  four  diverse 
countries provide different answers from those 
they  offer  when  asked  about  the  most  impor-
tant jobs to society (figure 5.1). They frequently 
mention working in the civil service or as a shop 
owner as the jobs they would prefer for them-
selves,  while  identifying  teachers  and  doctors 
as the most important jobs for societies. China 
is the only country where a job in civil service 
is seen as more important for society than for 
the individual. In the Arab Republic of Egypt, a 
job as a teacher is more valued individually than 
socially. And in Sierra Leone, being a farmer is 
appreciated both individually and socially, while 
in the other countries it is recognized as socially 
valuable but is not a preferred job.

This intuition can be developed into a more 
structured analysis of the reasons why some jobs 
may be more or less valuable to society than they 
are to those who hold them. Those reasons can 
be  grouped  under  three  main  headings,  each 
corresponding to one of the three development 
transformations.  Individual  jobs  can  improve 
the living standards of others in society, or they 

BOX 5.3    The concept of Decent Work and the Decent Work Agenda

Decent  Work  is  defined  as  “opportunities  for  women  and  men  to 
obtain  decent  and  productive  work  in  conditions  of  freedom, 
equity, security and human dignity.”a This definition is based on a 
broad  concept  of  work  as  encompassing  all  forms  of  economic 
activity.b The International Labour Organization has made Decent 
Work  for  all  the  organizing  principle  for  its  activities  and  has  set  
an  agenda  for  incorporating  the  goal  of  Decent  Work  for  all  into 
national  strategic  planning  objectives.c  The  ILO’s  Decent  Work 
Agenda is a policy approach based on four strategic objectives: fun-
damental principles and rights at work and international labor stan-
dards, productive and freely chosen employment, social protection, 
and social dialogue. 

At the global level, the ILO has defined Decent Work indicators 
to  measure  the  different  dimensions  of  the  concept  and  to  track 
progress over time. In 2010, the United Nations (UN) Summit on the 
Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  included  a  new  target 
under Goal 1 (eradicate extreme poverty and hunger): “achieve full 
and  productive  employment  and  Decent  Work  for  all,  including 
women and young people.”d The Decent Work indicators are being 

used to help countries measure progress and establish priorities. A 
limited set are used to monitor progress toward the MDG target.e

The  ILO’s  Decent  Work  Agenda  includes  a  threshold  below 
which no job should fall. The threshold has four components: pro-
ductive  employment  (not  simply  any  job),  basic  social  protection 
according to national conditions, opportunity for voice and organi-
zation, and rights at work. As an incremental agenda, Decent Work 
indicators  can  change,  depending  on  the  economic,  social,  and 
institutional progress of countries.

This  ILO  agenda  has  gained  considerable  traction  and  interna-
tional political buy-in over the past decade. First formulated at the 
International  Labour  Conference  in  1999,  it  is  now  part  of  the  ILO 
constitution and has been endorsed by heads of state at the UN Gen-
eral Assembly, the Group of 20, and regional authorities such as the 
European  Union,  the  African  Union,  the  Organization  of  American 
States, the Association of South East Asian Nations, and the Southern 
Cone Common Market (Mercosur). Many countries use the Decent 
Work concept to define development targets, identify policy priori-
ties, and measure progress toward meeting specified goals.

can adversely affect their earnings and employ-
ment  opportunities.  They  can  help  raise  the 
productivity of others, or they can harm them 
through their environmental impacts. And they 
can  support  more  peaceful  collective  decision 
making, or, alternatively, increase social tensions 
when they are based on privilege.

Spillovers from jobs

Good  jobs  for  development  are  those  with  the 
highest  payoff  to  society. As  a  first  approxima-
tion,  the  value  of  the  job  for  the  person  who 

holds it provides a good measure of the value of 
the job to society. But some jobs also have spill-
overs on the living standards of others, on aggre-
gate  productivity,  or  on  social  cohesion. When 
spillovers are positive, the job has a greater value 
to  society  than  it  has  to  the  person  who  holds 
it,  and  the  opposite  is  true  when  the  spillovers 
are negative. In principle, the spillovers can also 
be negligible, in which case there is no real dis-
tinction  between  the  individual  and  the  social 
perspective. Nonetheless, the idea that jobs can 
have sizable spillovers is at the core of several dis-
ciplines in the social sciences and has greatly in-
fluenced recent development thinking (box 5.4).

BOX 5.4   Economics and the social sciences deal with spillovers from jobs, under different names 

Several disciplines in economics and in the social sciences focus on 
the channels through which spillovers from jobs occur, even if they 
may not articulate it that way. One core focus of labor economics is to 
assess earnings differentials and their causes, including discrimina-
tion, uneven bargaining power, regulation, and taxation. The public 
finance literature also evaluates the impact on employment, capital 
intensity, and earnings of taxes and subsidies, including those used 
to  finance  social  insurance  contributions.  Gender  studies  examine 
the economic, social, and cultural determinants of gender discrimi-
nation  and  their  relationships  to  employment.  Poverty  analyses 
study  the  poverty  and  inequality  impact  of  job  distributions  and 
 different  growth  patterns.  Economic  geography  uncovers  the  pro-
ductivity impact of spatial concentration of jobs. International eco-
nomics   analyzes  the  resource  allocation  and  innovation  impetus 
provided  by  employment  in  export  sectors  and  foreign-owned 
companies. Environmental economics measures and values the neg-
ative (and positive) impacts of employment in different sectors, or 
using  different  techniques,  on  the  natural  resource  base.  Identity 
economics researches how behaviors and norms are influenced by 
the relationship between people and their peer groups, including 
through their jobs. The field of equity analysis has started to examine 

the degree to which job outcomes are shaped by the circumstances 
in which individuals are born, as opposed to their ability or effort. 
Finally,   conflict  studies  aim  to  identify  the  societal  conditions  that 
underlie tension not being managed constructively and peacefully, 
including access to jobs and fairness in their allocation.

These disciplines bring analytical rigor to the assessment of the 
gaps between the individual and social values of jobs, hence to the 
identification of good jobs for development.a

Although  they  may  not  be  explicitly  articulated  around  jobs, 
these  disciplines  have  shaped  recent  development  thinking.  The 
World Development Report 2007: Development and the Next Genera-
tiona  shows  that  opening  job  opportunities  for  young  people  is 
 catalytic  for  future  economic  and  social  development.  The  World 
Development Report 2009: Reshaping Economic Geography discusses 
reaping  the  benefits  of  agglomeration,  which  happens  through 
jobs, as a source of economic growth. The World Development Report 
2011: Conflict, Security, and Development makes the point that jobs 
are a key element for stabilization in post-conflict societies. And the 
World  Development  Report  2012:  Gender  Equality  and  Development 
provides  evidence  that  jobs  are  a  medium  to  promote  gender 
equity and transform it into social and economic progress.

Fully  valuing  the  contribution  jobs  make  
to development requires identifying the chan-
nels  through  which  the  spillovers  may  occur. 
Nine of them have received attention as critical 
for development (figure 5.2):

•   Earnings of others. Uneven bargaining power 
or inadequate regulation may result in labor 
earnings  that  are  either  too  low  or  too  high 
relative to the output generated by jobs. This 
distortion affects the earnings of the employer 
and  the  job  opportunities  of  other  workers. 
Taxpayers may also be affected when jobs are 
supported through transfers. Jobs that do not 
tax others, literally or figuratively, do more for 
development. 

•   Household allocations. Having a job and con-
tributing  resources  to  a  household’s  budget 
can  change  the  status  of  the  jobholder  and 
increase his or her say on how the budget is 
allocated. If the jobholder is a woman, spend-
ing  on  food  and  on  children  may  increase, 
which may result in greater well-being for the 
children. Jobs that empower women have the 
potential to generate such positive spillovers.
•   Poverty  reduction.  The  well-being  of  oth-
ers may be affected if they are altruistic and 
value poverty reduction in general, even when 
their own earnings do not change. Since jobs 
are the main avenue out of poverty, there is

161

social value in the availability of jobs that take 
others out of poverty. Employment opportu-
nities tilted in favor of the poor do more for 
development.

•   Agglomeration  effects.  Productivity  depends 
not  only  on  the  internal  efficiency  of  eco-
nomic  units  but  also  on  their  environment. 
Learning and imitation through labor turn-
over  and  interaction  with  suppliers,  as  well 
as a better matching of skills across a bigger 
pool  of  workers,  can  increase  productiv-
ity.  Hence,  jobs  in  functional  cities  tend  to 
be  good  jobs  for  development.  Conversely, 
negative effects can arise in overcrowded and 
congested cities.

•   Global integration. Knowledge spillovers also 
occur through international trade and parti-
cipation in global value chains. Firms that en-
gage in export markets tend to become more 
productive and, in doing so, they push other, 
less productive firms out of business. Know-
ledge  spillovers  from  foreign  direct  invest-
ment  (FDI)  increase  aggregate  productivity. 
Jobs that connect to global markets are thus 
good jobs for development.

•   Environmental effects. Jobs have negative im-
pacts  on  aggregate  productivity  when  they 
damage the environment or lead to an over-
use of scarce resources. But they can also have 
positive effects on the environment, as in the 
case of jobs to manage forests and other com-
mon resources. The social value of a job can-
not  be  assessed  without  taking  into  account 
its environmental impact.

•   Social identity. Jobs can impact the well-being 
of others by influencing the values and behav-
ior of those who hold them in ways that affect 
society at large. Jobs can shape the norms that 
influence  how  the  jobholder  interacts  with 
others, starting with basics such as reliability, 
punctuality, and courtesy. Depending on their 
characteristics,  jobs  can  foster  civic  engage-
ment and result in greater trust.

•   Networks. Jobs connect people to each other. 
They  convey  information  among  coworkers 
and  society  more  broadly.  They  impact  the 
integration  of  rural  migrants  in  new  urban 
settings. Jobs may also contribute to tolerance 
when  they  increase  interactions  with  people 
from different social and ethnic backgrounds.

•   Sense of fairness. A perceived absence of fair-
ness in the overall access to job opportuni-
ties,  beyond  one’s  own  job,  can  undermine 
the  sense  of  belonging.  Job  allocations  at 
odds  with  the  idea  of  equality  of  opportu-
nity may lead to disengagement from collec-
tive decision-making processes. Jobs that live 
up  to  standards  of  transparency  and  merit 
contribute to the sense of fairness in society.

Because  a  job  can  affect  the  well-being  of 
others and not only the well-being of the job-
holder, two jobs that may appear identical from 
an individual perspective could still be different 
from a social perspective. In a society that values 
poverty reduction, an informal job that takes a 
household out of poverty should be seen as more 
valuable to society. A job in a protected industry 
that  needs  support  through  transfers  (either 
by  taxpayers  or  by  consumers)  is  less  valuable 
to society, and even less valuable if the need for 
protection is associated with the use of outdated 
technology  that  results  in  high  environmental 
costs. The opposite holds for a job in an export 
industry  that  contributes  to  the  acquisition  of 
new technical and managerial knowledge from 
abroad and spreads it through interactions with 
suppliers; this job is even more valuable to so-
ciety  when  the  jobholder  is  a  woman  and  her 
work status empowers her. And the same is true 
for a job that gives a young person a sense of be-
longing in society and conveys to others a sense 
of opportunity (figure 5.3).

The  contribution  jobs  make  to  develop-
ment  varies,  depending  on  the  circumstances. 
In  low-  and  middle-income  countries,  poverty 
reduction  carries  significant  weight.  Productiv-
ity  effects  vary:  heavily  urbanized  and  highly 
connected  countries  such  as  Singapore  have 
internalized a large part of these effects already, 
while  urbanizing  countries  such  as  Bangladesh 
and  Guatemala  are  still  able  to  reap  significant 
benefits.  Jobs  in  illegal  mining  can  cause  envi-
ronmental  damage,  and  their  net  contribution 
to productivity growth is limited as a result. Jobs 
in Turkey’s wind energy parks, in contrast, likely 
contribute to all three transformations in a posi-
tive way: they offer earnings and job satisfaction 
to workers; they position Turkey at the forefront  
of  technological  developments  in  new  energy; 
and they often contribute to social cohesion by 
creating new livelihood opportunities for villages.

More  often  than  not,  however,  jobs  entail 
tradeoffs. A specific job can entail positive and 
negative spillovers simultaneously. Take, for ex-
ample,  a  job  that  requires  relatively  low-skills 
but  that  uses  outdated  technology  and  hence 
causes  environmental  damage.  From  a  social 
point of view, such a job has a positive spillover 
because it leads to poverty reduction, but it also 
exhibits a negative spillover through its environ-
mental  effect.  Similar  tradeoffs  can  exist  for  a 
job that connects the domestic economy glob-
ally but that has been obtained through connec-
tions, thereby decreasing the sense that the job 
market is fair.

Such  tradeoffs  can  take  strategic  dimen-
sions: in China, the nature and location of in-
vestments in roads have different implications 
for  jobs.  The  investments  yield  their  highest 
growth  returns  in  the  eastern  and  central  re-
gions of China, where the most productive jobs 
are. But their contribution to poverty reduction 
is greatest in the western regions, where living 
standards are lower.17 In such situations, soci-
etal choices are necessary. Assessing and map-
ping spillovers is an important first step toward 
informed decision making.

Can the development payoffs from 
jobs be quantified? 

Earnings from labor provide the first and most 
direct  measure  of  the  contribution  jobs  make 
to  development.  But  transformations  in  liv-
ing  standards,  productivity,  and  social  cohe-
sion happen at a faster pace when jobs lead to 
investments in children, give people the possi-
bility to acquire new skills through their work, 
or engage them more in society. Because these 
transformational aspects are seldom reflected in 
labor earnings, good jobs for development may 
not be as attractive to individuals as they are im-
portant to society. This is why, even in a context 
of  full  employment,  there  may  not  be  enough 
jobs for women in many developing countries, 
or enough jobs connected to world markets, or 
enough jobs for idle young men. Spillovers are 
thus especially relevant in countries where gen-
der  equality  is  far  from  assured,  urbanization 
and global integration are incipient, and conflict 
is still a possibility. 

Fully valuing the development payoffs from 
jobs entails assessing the earnings they provide, 
as well as their possible spillovers. In practice,

163

BOX 5.5    Several data sources can be used to quantify the development payoffs from jobs

Household  surveys  such  as  those  used  for  poverty  analysis  are  
a  critically  important  input  for  assessing  the  contribution  jobs  
make to society. Regular up-to-date, high-quality data on activity, 
employ ment, and earnings can be used to understand employment 
dynamics. Many countries around the world collect household data 
through  living  standards  surveys  and  labor  force  surveys.  Social 
security  administrations  in  countries  with  a  high  coverage  rate  of 
social programs record information about their contributors. Unfor-
tunately, few countries trace employment histories. Such histories 
(including employment transitions) are vital to achieving an under-
standing of how long young jobseekers are unemployed, whether 
unemployment  scars  the  middle-aged,  or  how  internal  migration 
supports rural families.

Plant-level  surveys  are  another  standard  input  to  understand 
the dynamics of job creation and destruction and their implications 
for  aggregate  productivity.  Many  countries  conduct  such  surveys 
out of a sampling frame supposed to capture all units in manufac-
turing; in some cases, the coverage extends to units in other sectors, 
such  as  trade.  Other  countries  collect  data  on  production  and 
employment through administrative records; the information is less 

detailed on inputs and therefore has limited potential in the estima-
tion of changes in productivity, but it gives a more comprehensive 
picture  of  how  firms  are  born,  grow,  decline  and  die  and  how 
employment evolves as a result. Unfortunately, only a few countries 
collect information on the myriad microenterprises in the informal 
sector. This information is vital to understanding where job creation 
occurs in the economy and where it contributes most to aggregate 
productivity.

Special household surveys inquiring about values and attitudes, 
together with qualitative assessments, are important instruments for 
assessing links between jobs on the one hand and beliefs and behav-
iors on the other. These surveys often provide information on trust in 
others and civic participation, and on the characteristics of respon-
dents  and  their  jobs.  Information  from  these  surveys  can  be  com-
bined with living standards and labor force surveys to identify popu-
lation  groups  at  risk,  and  analyze  how  jobs  are  associated  with 
peaceful collective decision making. Observing individual or cohort 
groups over time allows for an exploration of possible causal links 
among jobs, trust, behaviors, and attitudes.

this  amounts  to  identifying  the  gaps  between  
the individual and the social values of jobs (if 
any)  that  are  relevant  in  a  particular  country 
context. Such an evaluation requires data, some 
of  which  many  countries  are  now  collecting  
on a more or less regular basis (box 5.5). Using 
data  to  measure  the  full  social  value  of  a  job  
calls  for  rigorous  analysis  too.  Patterns  in  the  
data may result from spurious correlations, and 
the related conclusions may be tainted if indi-
viduals and firms with fundamentally different 
characteristics selected themselves into specific 
jobs or activities. Labor economics, productiv-
ity studies, and other social sciences have devel-
oped analytical tools for the analyses required. 
Sociological and anthropological methods can 
provide texture and context missing in quanti-
tative data. In some cases, randomized trials or 
natural  experiments  can  shed  light  on  the 
mechanisms at play. But methodological pitfalls 
abound, so the safest approach is to triangulate 
the available evidence.

Living standards

Three types of spillovers can enhance or under-
mine the direct contribution jobs make to liv-

ing standards: jobs can impact the earnings of 
others, they can alter the allocation of resources 
within households in a substantial way, and they 
can  contribute  to  shared  social  goals  such  as 
poverty reduction.

Earnings of others. Jobs in subsidized firms and 
in  bloated  public  sector  agencies  have  an  im-
pact on the earnings of others, as they lead to an 
excessive tax burden and a reduction of earn-
ings  (or  the  disappearance  of  jobs)  elsewhere 
in the economy. Jobs characterized by uneven 
bargaining power between employers and em-
ployees,  or  discrimination  against  women  or 
ethnic minority groups, have earnings that are 
too high or too low relative to the output gener-
ated by the job. 

The  tools  of  public  finance  can  be  used  to 
assess gaps between the individual and the so-
cial values of jobs in the case of jobs supported 
through  transfers.  Taxation  and  government 
spending affect earnings and modify incentives 
and thus have an impact on resource allocations, 
including employment. Analyses of the tax bur-
den  applying  to  capital  and  labor,  assessments 
of  cross-subsidization  between  individuals  or 
firms,  or  evaluations  of  the  impacts  of  payroll 

164 

  WO R L D   D E V E LO P M E N T   R E P O RT   2 0 1 3

taxation can identify a gap between the individ-
ual value and the social value of a job.

A tax wedge does not necessarily imply that 
the individual and the social value of a job dif-
fer,  or  that  employment  effects  are  large.  The 
methodological pitfall to avoid in this case is to 
assume  that  individuals  attach  no  value  to  the 
taxes or contributions they pay. If workers value 
social  security  contributions  as  an  entitlement 
to  deferred  benefits,  their  net  burden  is  lower 
than the contribution rate suggests. If they value   
the contribution in full, there would be no mis-
allocation  of  resources.  In  some  systems,  con-
tributions  and  benefits  are  closely  linked;  in  
others,  the  link  is  looser  and  redistribution 
stronger.  But  even  when  benefits  are  low  com-
pared  to  taxes,  the  effects  on  employment  de-
pend on how much of the taxes employers can 
pass  on  to  employees  through  lower  wages.  In 
the extreme case, when the number of workers 
seeking wage employment is fixed, the entire tax 
is paid by workers, and employment is the same 
then as without a tax.18 In Turkey, a reduction in 
social  security  taxes  would  result  in  higher  net 
wages  and  lower  total  labor  cost  only  partially, 
thereby moderating the change in employment. 
The effect is somewhat higher, though, for lower-
skilled  workers  earning  around  the  minimum 
wage.19

The tools of labor economics can be used to 
measure the gaps between the actual earnings of 
specific groups of workers and the earnings they 
would have in the absence of uneven bargaining 
power or discrimination. Earnings functions (a 
standard tool of labor economics) can provide 
an  estimate  of  the  magnitude  of  those  gaps. 
Actual  earnings  are  lower  than  they  otherwise 
would be in the case of women, ethnic minori-
ties, and people working in the agricultural sec-
tor; they tend to be higher in the case of union 
members.  Some  gaps  diminish  with  economic 
development, others persist (figure 5.4). On the 
surface  at  least,  the  gender  and  occupational 
gaps show no sign of disappearing. 

While these exercises are informative, earn-
ings  gaps  may  result  from  differences  in  the 
characteristics of jobs or workers not accounted 
for in the analysis. Gender gaps can stem from 
discrimination but also from choices about the 
work-life balance. Union gaps may signal strong 
bargaining power but could also reflect higher 
productivity  of  organized  workers.  Rural  pay 
deficits  may  be  affected  by  unobservable  dif-

ferences  between  the  workers  who  migrated 
to  the  cities  and  those  who  stayed  behind.  So, 
even  when  the  gaps  are  rigorously  measured, 
disentangling  the  reasons  behind  them  is  an 
important step before policy conclusions can be 
drawn.

Household  allocations.  Who  holds  a  job  can 
matter for how household earnings evolve and 
are spent. Job opportunities for youth are par-
ticularly  important. A  difficult  transition  from 
school to work can lead to scarring—a negative 
impact on long-term earnings prospects, hence 
of  future  household  expenditures.  The  risk  of 
unemployment  later  in  life  is  higher  for  those 
transitions.20 
with  difficult  school-to-work 
Jobs that go to women might also benefit other 
members of society as well as the woman hold-
ing the job. Women generally have lower labor 
force  participation  rates  than  men  and  typi-
cally earn less than their male counterparts, but 
employment  outside  the  household  often  em-
powers  them.21 A  body  of  evidence  has  found 
that  spending  decisions  depend  on  the  share 
of  household  income  contributed  by  different 
members  of  the  household.  Women’s  control 
over household resources leads to more spend-
ing on food and children’s schooling.

The  impact  womens’  employment  has  on 
household  allocations  can  be  quantified  using 
standard tools in poverty and gender analyses. 
In Mexico, for example, higher women’s income 
shares were associated with more food and chil-
dren’s clothing and less alcohol.22 Similar results 
were  observed  in  Bangladesh,  Côte  d’Ivoire, 
and South Africa.23 In the Republic of Congo, a 
higher female share in total household income 
was associated with significantly higher expen-
ditures on food and significantly lower expen-
diture on clothing for adults and entertainment 
(figure 5.5).24 However, it should not be assumed 
that impacts are the same everywhere. Providing 
cash transfers in Burkina Faso boosted routine 
preventive care for children, regardless of which 
parent received the money.25 And evaluations in 
Ghana and Sri Lanka show that microcredit was 
invested to a larger extent into a business by men 
than by women.26

Another  approach  looks  directly  at  the  im-
pacts  of  women’s  employment  on  human  de-
velopment  outcomes,  such  as  children’s  educa-
tional attainment and health. In a rural setting in 
southern India, an increase in annual female in-

cent increase in labor demand for adult women 
raised the chance of having a daughter in good 
health by 10 percent.28 In addition, the children

turing  thanks  to  the  opening  of  new  factories 
closer to home were significantly taller.29 

Poverty  reduction.  Job  opportunities  and  em-
ployment transitions are major determinants of 
changes in both individual living standards and 
overall  poverty  in  a  country.  If  societies  value 
poverty reduction, a job lifting an individual or 
a household out of poverty increases the well-
being  of  others.  A  spillover  exists  then,  as  ag-
gregate welfare increases beyond the increase in

Note: Figure is based on microsimulations using data from household surveys. In each country, the 
employment rate was exogenously increased by 3 percentage points. The baseline scenario allocated 
the new jobs to those who had the highest likelihood of being employed. Earnings were imputed on the

employment likelihood among the poor.

the  well-being  of  the  individual  or  household 
escaping poverty. 

The  way  new  job  opportunities  are  distrib-
uted  is  of  major  importance  for  poverty  re-
duction. Poverty profiles, revealing the charac-
teristics  of  the  poor,  help  identify  which  types 
jobs—and in which locations—would make the 
biggest difference to them. Microsimulations us-
ing household survey data allow estimating the 
impact  of  changes  in  employment  on  poverty 
rates. For instance, increasing the employment 
rate is of highest priority in Bulgaria and Latvia, 
two aging countries. Consider the poverty alle-
viation effects of raising the employment rate by 
3 percentage points depending on who, among 
those currently not working, gets the additional 
jobs. If the jobs went to the people whose indi-
vidual  characteristics  make  them  more  easily 
employable, poverty would fall by 1.1 percent-
age  points  in  Bulgaria  and  by  1.2  percentage 
points in Latvia. If new employment opportuni-
ties instead went to the most employable among 
the  poor,  poverty  would  fall  by  4.7  percentage 
points in Bulgaria and by 4.1 percentage points 
in Latvia (figure 5.6). 

 

Productivity

Spillovers from jobs on the productivity of other 
jobs can happen through three main channels. 
Jobs in functional cities lead to greater special-
ization and mutual learning. Jobs connected to 
global markets allow for the acquisition of more 
advanced technological and managerial knowl-
edge.  And  through  the  production  process  in 
which they are embedded, jobs can have nega-
tive—or positive—effects on the environment. 

Agglomeration  effects.  The  spatial  concentra-
tion of activity is a strong driver of productivity 
growth in developing countries. Effects can ma-
terialize within sectors (localization economies) 
or  between  sectors  (urbanization  economies). 
The  sharing  of  inputs,  better  labor  matching, 
and  knowledge  spillovers  are  the  main  forces 
behind  the  geographical  concentration  of  in-
dustries  and  economic  activity  in  urban  envi-
ronments. The sharing of inputs facilitates the 
emergence of specialized producers of interme-
diate goods and services. Proximity allows firms 
to  more  easily  find  workers  to  fill  positions. 
Knowledge spillovers allow firms to learn about 
new technologies, products, and practices from 
other firms operating in the vicinity. These ag-
glomeration effects signal a difference between 
the private and social values of jobs.  

The  tools  of  urban  economics  can  be  used 
to  assess  the  potential  gains  from  agglomera-
tion.  In  industrial  countries,  as  city  employ-
ment  increases  by  10  percent,  wages  and  firm 
productivity  in  the  city  grow  by  0.2  to  1.0 
percent.30  To  give  a  sense  of  the  magnitudes 
implied,  if  wages  and  productivity  were  to  in-
crease  by  0.3  percent,  workers  moving  from  
a city with 5,000 inhabitants to a metropolis of  
5  million  would  see  their  earnings  increase  by 
23 percent.31 Nonetheless, not all workers bene-
fit equally from living and working together in 
cities, nor do they contribute equally to produc-
tivity growth. Workers with better cognitive and 
social skills tend to benefit more.32 Workers also 
enjoy  higher  wages  when  they  are  surrounded 
by a more educated labor force.33

The  association  between  urban  scale  and 
productivity has also been documented in many 
developing economies, including Brazil, China, 
India,  Indonesia,  the  Republic  of  Korea,  and 
Turkey.34 In Taiwan, China, a 10 percent increase 
in total manufacturing employment in a locality

causes employment in specific industrial sectors 
to increase between 3.0 and 7.5 percent (figure 
5.7).35  Enterprise  surveys  also  show  that  firms 
grow  faster  in  large  cities.36  In  many  develop-
ing  countries,  however,  the  poor  functionality 
of  cities  undermines  the  potential  gains  from 
proximity.  Inefficiencies  in  labor,  land,  and 
housing markets may cause poor functionality 
in cities. Poor functionality may also result from 
deficits  in  transportation  and  communication 
infrastructure, especially for smaller cities where 
market access is critical.37

But agglomeration can also come with higher 
costs, from more expensive land to worse con-
gestion and pollution in cities with 1 million to 
3 million people. In the United States, between 
1980 and 2000, the number of annual hours per 
person lost to traffic delays increased from 4 to 
22.38  Traffic  in  central  London  moves  at  only 
11 miles an hour.39 In Mexico City, the annual 
cost of traffic delays amounts to US$580 a per-
son, or 3 percent of annual per capita income.40 
Congestion  and  pollution  limit  agglomeration 
effects.41  In  California,  a  reduction  in  ozone

concentrations of 10 parts per billion would in-
crease worker productivity by 4.2 percent. 42 

Analytical tools from the management litera-
ture can be used to assess the impact of industrial 
clusters on productivity.43 In many low-income 
countries, industrial clusters account for a large 
share  of  manufacturing  employment,  includ- 
ing self-employment.44 Clustering is more com-
mon in light manufacturing industries intensive 
in  unskilled  labor,  such  as  garments,  footwear, 
furniture, and metalworking. The formation of 
a cluster often starts with a pioneer, typically a 
former trader or engineer who is able to iden-
tify a new, profitable business. Success leads to 
imitation, and a large number of relatively small 
and  similar  enterprises  emerges  in  the  vicin-
ity.  The  management  literature  can  help  iden-
tify  dynamic  clusters,  where  jobs  have  positive 
spillovers.

Global  integration.  The  fragmentation  of  pro-
duction across borders is one of the most notable 
features  of  the  global  economy.45 Value  chains 
connect  firms  and  jobs  across  borders,  be  it

through arms-length trade or through intrafirm 
transactions.  Global  integration  improves  do-
mestic resource allocation because it puts greater 
pressure on firms to be competitive. Exporting 
allows  the  most  productive  firms  to  grow.  But 
in doing so, they also exert pressure on the least 
productive ones to contract or exit. Global in-
tegration  also  generates  knowledge  spillovers. 
These  arise  through  exposure  to  new  tech-
nologies embodied in traded goods or through  
new  management  practices  in  companies  re-
ceiving  FDI.  Knowledge  spillovers  take  place 
horizontally,  between  competitors,  and  verti-
cally, through buyer-supplier relationships. 

International  economics  has  devoted  con-
siderable  efforts  to  quantifying  the  productiv-
ity impacts of global integration. In Colombia, 
productivity  increased  faster  at  the  plant  level 
during the trade liberalization period than dur-
ing  the  import  substitution  period.46  In  India, 
industry  restructuring  immediately  following 
the trade reforms of 1991, including the entry 
and  exit  of  firms,  contributed  significantly  to 
productivity increases.47 In Brazil, Côte d’Ivoire, 
and Turkey, the lowering of trade barriers led to 
a  reduction  of  markups—a  sign  of  intensified 
competition.48  Productivity-enhancing  effects 
of exports have been found in China; Indonesia; 
Korea; Slovenia; and Taiwan, China, as well as at 
the regional level in East Asia and Sub-Saharan 
Africa.49 

A specialized literature focuses on the knowl-
edge spillovers and productivity impacts of mul-
tinationals and FDI. In Indonesia, when a plant 
switched  from  domestic  to  foreign  ownership, 
its  total  factor  productivity  increased  by  13.5 
percent  within  three  years.  In  Brazil,  wages  of 
incumbent workers in domestic firms were pos-
itively affected by the share of workers who pre-
viously worked with multinationals. In Ghana, 
firms whose owners worked for multinationals 
in the same industry were more productive than 
other domestic firms.50 In developing countries, 
the knowledge spillovers from FDI may be more 
important than their impact on resource alloca-
tion (figure 5.8).51

Research can help assess whether the knowl-
edge  spillovers  from  global  integration  trickle 
down  to  small  informal  enterprises  through 
value chains. Larger enterprises are more likely 
to  become  suppliers  to  foreign  companies  or 
to  be  directly  acquired  by  multi nationals.  But 
they  tend  to  contract  out  noncore  businesses

for cost efficiency, bringing smaller local com-
panies  into  the  value  chain.  Contracting  out 
provides opportunities for small and microen-
terprises to also reap the benefits of knowledge 
spillovers.52

Research can also shed light on the obstacles 
preventing the productivity spillovers from glob-
ally  integrated  jobs  from  materializing.  Cross-
country analysis shows that the degree of labor 
market flexibility, barriers to firm entry, and in-
frastructure development substantially influence 
the impact of openness on growth.53 Knowledge 
spillovers hinge on the ability of the local econ-
omy  to  absorb  them—human  capital  and  re-
search and development capacity are important. 
Local  firms  need  a  certain  level  of  production 
and  technological  capabilities  to  be  selected  as 
suppliers by foreign companies. When technol-
ogy gaps between local firms and foreign com-
panies are large, productivity spillovers are less 
likely to occur.54 

Environmental impacts. Jobs that overuse natu-
ral  resources  or  damage  the  environment  are 
less  productive  than  their  direct  output  might 
suggest. The environmental damage they create 
imposes a negative spillover on others, resulting 
in a lower net contribution to aggregate output. 
Natural resources such as the atmosphere, wa-
ter, forests, and soil provide services useful for 
economic  activities  and  necessary  for  human 
life,  but  they  are  often  overused  because  their 
cost from a private point of view falls short of 
their true social cost.55 The emission of green-
house gases is an example of a negative spillover. 
The  tools  of  environmental  economics  can 
be used to quantify the cost of emissions associ-
ated with jobs. Worldwide, industry is respon-
sible  for  over  one-fifth  of  carbon  emission.56 
Globally, the average cost from fuel combustion 
in manufacturing is in the order of US$82 per 
job  per  year.57  However,  this  average  hides  an 
enormous diversity in the emission cost of pro-
duction across countries, industries, and tech-
nologies.  Across  countries,  a  negative  relation 
can  be  observed  between  the  annual  emission 
cost per job and the emission efficiency of pro-
duction.  Richer  countries  tend  to  have  higher 
environmental  costs  associated  with  one  job, 
but, in parallel, these jobs have a high produc-
tivity so that the emission intensity per unit of 
manufacturing output tends to be relatively low 
(figure 5.9).

hand with low emissions per unit of output

Sources: World Development Report 2013 team estimates based on IEA 2011, International Income Distri-
bution Database (I2D2), and the ILO’s Labor Statistics. 
Note: CO2 = carbon dioxide; GDP = gross domestic product. Estimates are based on data from the Interna-
tional Energy Agency and methods and emission factors from the revised 1996 Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. The figure considers only CO2 
emissions from fuel combustion associated with productive activities in the manufacturing and con-
struction sectors. Bubbles represent countries. The size of the bubbles represents the comparable size of 
manufacturing GDP in constant prices.

Policies to contain carbon emissions and re-
duce  environmental  damage  rely  on  price  and 
quantity instruments aimed at transferring the 
cost to producers. These policies should increase 
net output per job, accounted for in green terms. 
However, in the short term, they could result in 
fewer  jobs  if  natural  resources  and  labor  are 
complements in production.

Policies  also  try  to  promote  job  creation  in 
more  environmentally  friendly  industries.  Jobs 
in enterprises that produce wind mills for elec-
tricity generation, construct water and soil con-
servation  systems,  and  plant  and  manage  trees 
fall in this category. These are often called green 
jobs,  with  different  definitions  attached  to  the 
term.  Industries  matching  the  most  common 
definitions  of  green  jobs  tend  to  be  relatively 
small in many developing countries, with Brazil 
and China notable exceptions (box 5.6).58

mental spillovers from jobs, it is likely that the 
activities with the greatest potential to mitigate 
adverse  environmental  damage  in  develop-

BOX 5.6    International definitions of green jobs can be too narrow for developing countries

While the concept of green growth is well developed, there is less 
consensus on the concept of green jobs.a The Organisation for Eco-
nomic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD)  uses  this  label  for 
jobs  linked  to  environmental  industries.b  The  European  Commis-
sion  focuses  on  employment  in  industries  whose  products  are 
deemed beneficial to the environment.c Examples include jobs in 
renewable energy sectors and low-carbon manufacturing. Several 
national  governments  are  developing  their  own  definitions  of 
green jobs, both for statistical purposes as well as to inform policy 
making.

The  United  Nations  Environment  Programme  defines  green 
jobs  as  “positions  in  agriculture,  manufacturing,  construction, 
installation,  and  maintenance,  as  well  as  scientific  and  technical, 
administrative,  and  service-related  activities  that  contribute 
 substantially  to  preserving  or  restoring  environmental  quality.”d 
For the United Nations Environment Programme and the Interna-
tional Labour Organization, these jobs must also qualify as Decent  
Work.

But these definitions can be too narrow. In developing countries, 
some  jobs  associated  with  green  growth  that  have  prospects  for 
substantial expansion, such as biofuel and biomass production, may 
not  qualify  as  Decent  Work.e  Moreover,  the  focus  on  renewable 
energy  and  low-carbon  manufacturing  may  shift  attention  away 
from activities with positive environmental impacts that also pro-
vide higher earnings to the poor. 

Consider efforts toward reduced forest degradation and sustain-
able management of trees.f Tree resources outside of closed forests 
are  becoming  increasingly  important  to  satisfy  the  demand  for 
charcoal,  firewood,  timber,  and  nonwood  forest  products.  Locally 
managed  reforestation  and  regeneration  of  degraded  landscapes 
may generate income opportunities for poor people as well as posi-
tive environmental impacts. Trees with the capacity to fix nitrogen 
have been used to improve soil fertility and provide fodder, wood, 
and fuel. Such enhanced tree management has helped increase sor-
ghum  yields  by  as  much  as  85  percent  in  some  areas  and  millet 
yields by as much as 50 percent.

ing countries lie outside the modern sector, in 
areas such as agriculture and forestry manage-
ment. Agriculture and deforestation account for 
nearly  30  percent  of  the  greenhouse  gas  emis-
sions in the world.59 Low-productivity agricul-
ture  leads  to  deforestation  as  cultivated  areas 
are  expanded.60  As  such,  efforts  to  reduce  the 
environmental spillovers from jobs in develop-
ing countries are bound to concern rural areas, 
affecting  farming  and  rural  livelihoods.61  For 
example, they may involve community partici-
pation in the management of commons such as 
forests and natural habitats.

Social cohesion

If jobs change values, behaviors, and attitudes of 
people,  they  can  influence  how  societies  func-
tion, specifically, how groups in society are able 
to resolve tensions and engage in peaceful col-
lective  decision  making.  Three  such  spillovers 
from jobs to social cohesion are social identity, 
networks, and a sense of fairness. The effect of 
jobs  on  social  identity  can  be  particularly  im-

portant for youth. Jobs can contribute to social-
ization and the process of acquiring values and 
behaviors for the workplace and society.62

Social  identity.  A  job  can  influence  the  social 
groups  that  individuals  associate  with,  their 
behaviors, and the norms that shape those be-
haviors.63 The degree to which a job, or its char-
acteristics,  shapes  the  way  individuals  perceive 
themselves  in  their  community  and  society 
varies with traditions, culture, and the level of 
economic development. But when the relation-
ship is significant, a spillover from jobs to social 
cohesion exists.

Quantifying spillovers from jobs on social co-
hesion is bound to be more difficult than for liv-
ing standards or productivity. However, a rough 
assessment  is  possible  using  household  surveys 
as well as qualitative studies. For instance, about 
half of respondents in China judge their jobs to 
be  somewhat  or  absolutely  meaningful,  but  in 
Sierra Leone the share is 90 percent, potentially 
signaling the social importance of jobs in a low-
income and post-conflict setting.

Behaviors  and  norms  can  also  be  changed 
by  perceptions  about  access  to  jobs—by  rais-
ing  peoples’  expectations  and  aspirations  for 
the future—and in some cases these changes in 
perceptions can be gauged as well. For instance, 
school  enrollments  in  Bangladesh  increased 
among  girls  after  garment  factories  opened 
within  commuting  distance  of  their  villages.64 
No such effect was observed among boys, while 
some older girls dropped out of school to take 
up  the  new  job  opportunity  (figure  5.10).  As  
jobs in the fac tories became available to women, 
it  is  likely  that  parents  saw  more  employment 
opportunities  for  their  daughters  and  realized 
the importance of education. The women work-
ing in these garment factories thus set an exam-
ple for other women and girls.

Program  evaluations  are  another  source  of 
information on the spillovers from jobs on social 
cohesion.  For  instance,  the  Programa  Juventud 
y Empleo (Youth and Employment Program) in 
the  Dominican  Republic  reaches  young  people 
who  have  not  finished  secondary  school,  are 
unemployed, and are living in poor households. 
Participants  receive  a  combination  of  voca-
tional training and training in life skills, includ-
ing self-esteem, teamwork, and communication 
skills,  followed  by  internships  at  private  sector 

firms.65  The  program  has  led  to  a  decrease  in 
involvement in gangs, violence, and other risky 
be havior,  including  drug  use  and  unprotected  
sex.  Participants  described  the  positive  impact 
on their self-esteem and behaviors.

Networks. Jobs can create new contacts and be a 
vehicle to transmit information. On the negative 
side,  they  can  also  have  an  exclusionary  effect, 
moving  the  individual  further  from  the  wider 
society. Positive network effects can give people 
a stake in their community or society; negative 
effects can increase social distance.

Again,  surveys  can  inquire  about  these  dy-
namics as a first entry to gauge whether a spill-
over  exists.  In  four  countries,  participants  in  a 
survey were asked whether their job was useful 
or not in establishing contacts with other people, 
providing information about societal matters or 
other  jobs,  or  helping  with  news  about  good 
deals (on food, for example). Only a quarter of 
respondents in China, but fully three-quarters of 
those in Sierra Leone judged these network ef-
fects to be at least somewhat important (figure 
5.11). While comparisons across countries need 
to  be  interpreted  with  caution,  comparisons 
across individuals in the same country may be 
informative.

Quantitative methods are necessary to con-
textualize network effects. Surveys in Bosnia and 
Herzegovina  and  the  former Yugoslav  Repub-
lic  of  Macedonia  have  found  that  the  number 
of people willing to work or do business with 
someone  of  a  different  ethnicity  was  greater 
than the number of people in favor of intereth-
nic cooperation in schools or neighborhoods.66 
Focus groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 
late  1990s  found  that  the  workplace  was “the 
area in which there is the greatest support for 
ethnic  cooperation.”67  Business  people  work-
ing in print and packaging, food and beverages, 
construction, and retail in Trinidad and Tobago 
have  reported  that  interactions  through  work 
with  others  of  different  ethnicities  have  posi-
tively influenced their social life.68

Sense  of  fairness.  Whether  access  to  jobs  is  fair 
naturally  depends  on  a  subjective  evaluation. 
Opinion  surveys  can  provide  an  assessment 
of how fair the job market is judged to be, and 
tracking  such  evaluations  over  time  can  be  of 
guidance  to  policy  makers.  About  30  percent  
of  Chinese  respondents  feel  that  the  most- 
qualified people get jobs—an indication that rel-

atively few people judge jobs to be distributed on 
the basis of merit. In Colombia as well as  Sierra 
Leone, the percentages were significantly higher.
Beyond these subjective assessments, fairness 
in access to jobs can actually be measured rigor-
ously, building on the emerging literature on in-
equality of opportunity. This literature explores 
to what degree factors beyond talent and effort 
matter  in  accessing  jobs.  These  factors  include 
the  circumstances  in  which  a  person  is  born: 
location,  family  background,  gender,  ethnic-
ity,  and  language.69  A  society  that  offers  equal 
opportunities  would  record  little  influence  of 
these  circumstances  on  job  trajectories  much 
later in the life. In some countries, however, the 
share  of  inequality  that  arises  from  such  birth 
circumstances is large. In this case, the existence 
of  deeply  rooted  inequities  determines  the  life 
chances  from  early  on  and  becomes  apparent 
later on through the access to jobs and the re-
lated rewards.70 The approach can also be used 
to assess the importance of different factors that 
contribute to inequality in employment oppor-
tunities. Among several countries in Eastern and 
Central Europe, father’s education is a driver for 
inequity in access to jobs, especially in the Rus-

The  assessment  of  the  social  value  of  jobs  is 
important  for  the  identification  of  what  good 
jobs for development are in a particular coun-
try  context.  Such  assessments  can  be  pursued 

with  a  variety  of  means.  Some  of  them  allow 
for an actual quantification, some others for a 
qualitative treatment of the difference between 
the individual value and the social value of jobs. 
Assessing  the  social  value  of  different  types  of 
jobs can inform policy discussions about trade-
offs  and  priorities  for  developmental  policies. 
The relevant spillovers are bound to be different 
in  countries  at  different  levels  of  development 
and  with  different  characteristics,  thus  leading 
to diverse jobs agendas.

Skills or jobs—which comes first?

Since  human  capital  theory  first  established  a 
link between skills and economic performance, 
it  generally  has  been  held  that  education  and 
training are wise investments for increasing em-
ployment and earnings—and are hence neces-
sary  ingredients  for  growth  and  job  creation. 
The  risk  of  living  in  poverty  declines  with  the 
acquisition  of  basic  cognitive  skills,  especially 
numeracy  and  literacy,  and  the  associated  en-
hancement in earning opportunities. Skills, es-
pecially  cognitive  abilities,  are  strongly  related 
to productivity growth, more so than school at-
tendance rates.71 They also are closely associated 
with  structural  transformation,  especially  for 
low- and lower-middle-income countries where 
they create opportunities for people outside of 
agriculture.72 Across  1,500  subnational  regions 
in 110 countries, education emerges as the criti-
cal  determinant  of  knowledge  spillovers  and 
entrepreneurship.73  And  skills  can  shape  how 
jobs link people to neighbors, communities, and 
societies.74

But around the world, available skills are not 
fitting well with the demands of the economy. 
Skills  mismatches  are  arguably  growing  rather 
than shrinking. Albeit not easy to pinpoint, up 
to one-third of the employed in countries as di-
verse as Brazil, Costa Rica, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, 
and Tanzania are either under- or over-qualified 
for the work they do.75 Managers of registered, 
formal firms around the world judge workforce 
skills  as  an  obstacle  of  above-average  impor-
tance in the production process.76 In countries 
at all development levels, skills obstacles are also 
judged  to  be  more  acute  now  than  in  the  first 
half of the 2000s (figure 5.13).

Skills shortages are an especially serious con-
straint  for  the  most  dynamic  entrepreneurs.77 
Larger  as  well  as  younger  and  growing  firms 
tend to identify skills as a constraint more than 
medium-sized  and  smaller  firms.78  Export- 
oriented firms in Indonesia and the Philippines 
report  skills  bottlenecks  more  than  firms  pro-
ducing for the domestic market in those coun-
tries.79  Across  106  developing  countries,  firms 
that  adopt  technology  more  rapidly  and  those 
that are more globally integrated take longer to 

fill  job  vacancies  through  external  candidates 
than  other  firms—a  sign  of  skill-related  con-
straints  being  more  binding.80  On  the  other 
hand, farmers and entrepreneurs of unregistered 
firms  in  both  rural  and  urban  environments 
tend to rate skills bottlenecks as less severe.81 

The  straightforward  response  to  such  mis-
matches would be for private firms or individu-
als to upgrade skills through further education 
or  training—but  several  well-known  reasons 
prevent this from occurring. Firms and farms—
especially  smaller  ones—and  workers  seldom 
have  the  necessary  funds  nor  can  they  borrow 
for this purpose.82 Firms are also reluctant to in-
vest in training employees for fear that workers 
will leave after being trained.83 And both firms 
and workers may lack the information needed 
to identify skills gaps.

Because of such market failures, policy mak-
ers often turn to education and training systems 
to deal with high unemployment or stifled pro-
ductivity growth. Many countries are currently 
making  a  big  push  to  hone  the  skills  of  the 
current and soon-to-be workforce through in-
creased emphasis on on-the-job training and on 
pre-employment  (vocational)  education.  Tur-
key’s Public Employment Agency has expanded 
vocational  training  enrollment  almost  tenfold 
since  2007,  delivering  close  to  250,000  courses 
in 2011. India has launched the National Skills 
Mission with a stated goal of training 500 mil-
lion people by 2022.

The pitfalls of skills building

The  importance  of  skills  cannot  be  over- 
stated  (box  5.7).  But  caution  is  needed  before 
jumping  from  this  recognition  to  the  launch-
ing  of  large  skills-building  programs.  The  root 
cause  of  skill  shortages  or  mismatches  might 
not lie with the education and training system. 
Shortages  and  mismatches  may  instead  result 
from wrong signals generated by market distor-
tions and institutional failures elsewhere in the 
economy. If a civil service career pays overly well, 
young  people  may  study  to  obtain  such  jobs, 
even  if  they  need  to  queue  for  them.  This  can

Note: The figure shows the changes in the relative importance of skills obstacles between beginning and end of the 2000s. The relative skill obstacle is defined as the ratio between 
(a) the share of firm managers saying that lack of skills is a major or severe obstacle and (b) the share of firm managers rating other constraints as major or severe. A positive score 
indicates that the skills constraint became more severe relative to others.

BOX 5.7   How skills are formed, and how they can be measured

Skills  are  acquired  throughout  life.  People  learn,  adapt,  and  form 
their  skills  through  a  multitude  of  interactions  and  mechanisms 
within  the  household  and  neighborhood,  during  the  formative 
years of schooling, at work, and in training. Cognitive skills include 
verbal  ability,  working  memory,  numeracy,  and  problem-solving 
abilities.  Social  skills  are  based  on  personality  traits  that  underlie 
behaviors such as teamwork, reliability, discipline, or work effort.a 
Technical skills enable the performance of specific tasks. Because all 
jobs require a combination of skills that are formed in multiple ways 
and  in  diverse  circumstances,  policy  makers  face  complex  chal-
lenges in forging the best path for skills development.

The first months and years of life are the most crucial for skill for-
mation. This is when intelligence and learning abilities, the founda-
tions  for  the  development  of  core  cognitive  and  social  skills,  are 
cemented.b Brain maturation occurs in steps, with new skills build-
ing on earlier ones. If the foundation is strong, higher-order cogni-
tive  and  social  skills  can  be  added  later  on.  This  leads  to  higher 
adaptability in rapidly changing job environments and the acquisi-
tion  of  job-specific  techniques.  In  the  slums  of  Mumbai,  a  special 
program run in parallel to primary schooling raised children’s self-

esteem, self-efficacy, and aspirations, increasing scores on school-
leaving examinations and initial labor market outcomes.c But while 
foundations are laid early on, skills are also shaped after childhood 
and in working life.

Attention to the measurement of skills has gained prominence 
worldwide.  Achievement  tests  provide  infor mation  for  parents, 
instructors, and administrators, and enable a better understanding 
of  systemwide  performance  and  achievements.  While  the  skills 
measured on these tests appear to be purely academic in nature, 
test  scores  reflect  more  than  individuals’  cognitive  skills.  A  good 
part of the variation in achievement tests can be attributed to per-
sonality traits or social skills as well as to incentive systems. These 
personality traits and social skills are critical in predicting individu-
als’ life outcomes, including educational attainment and earnings.

More  recently,  efforts  have  gone  in  the  direction  of  assessing 
adult  competencies,  by  measuring  the  variety,  intensity,  and  fre-
quency of skills used in the workplace. These measures range from 
assessing different types of manual and workplace skills of a more 
routine  manner  to  complex  capabilities,  such  as  problem  solving 
abilities.d

lead to the acquisition of skills that are irrelevant 
in the private sector and to unrealistic expecta-
tions, as was observed, for example, in the Arab 
Republic  of  Egypt.84 Similarly,  compressed  pay 
scales  reduce  the  incentives  to  invest  more  in 
education  and  training.85  Lack  of  information 
about  employment  opportunities,  transporta-
tion costs, or housing market failures may be the 
real reasons why workers do not take available 
jobs. In all of these cases, constraints that seem to 
be skills related actually reside outside the edu-
cation and training system. 

Besides, the successful delivery of skills-build-
ing  services  is  difficult.  Pre-employment  and 
on-the-job training show varying success in the 
developing  world.  On-the-job  training  is  con-
sistently found to go hand-in-hand with higher 
labor earnings and productivity increases, even 
more so in developing than in industrial coun-
tries.86 But only a fraction of workers have access 
to it; those with less education and those work-
ing in smaller and informal enterprises seldom 
have  the  opportunity  to  benefit  from  training. 
Technical and vocational education (TVE) has 
a mixed record: compared with general educa-
tion, TVE led to higher earnings in Rwanda, Sri 
Lanka, and Thailand, more or less equal earn-
ings in Indonesia and India, and lower earnings 
in Pakistan.87 The reach of TVE in rural areas is 
often very limited.88 In some countries, TVE has 
actually  reinforced  socioeconomic  inequalities 
rather than fostered social mobility.89 Poor qual-
ity and inequitable access are key constraints in 
many countries.

Accountability  and  governance  arrange-
ments are often the weak link of skills-building 
initiatives,  with  institutional  failures  often  re-
placing  market  failures.  On  the  positive  side, 
modern and flexible skills-development strate-
gies have generally replaced old-fashioned and 
mechanical  manpower  planning  (box  5.8). 
Many countries have also created oversight en-
tities, such as the Pakistan Sindh Technical and 
Vocational Training Authority, to separate qual-
ity control and management of providers from 
financing. In India, the National Skills Develop-
ment Strategy is based on the principle that the 
institutions  in  charge  of  training,  certification, 
and accreditation should be strictly separated.90 
On  the  negative  side,  scattered  responsibilities 
across  many  ministries,  distance  from  the  pri-
vate  sector,  slow  response  to  rapidly  changing 
skill needs, and capture by providers continue to 

plague training programs and pre-employment 
education around the world.

What is being taught matters as well. Social 
skills  are  often  the  ones  missing,  but  they  can 
rarely be acquired in schools or training centers. 
In India, employers of engineers stress reliabil-
ity,  willingness  to  learn,  and  entrepreneurship 
as more important than specific technical skills, 
or  the  command  of  mathematics,  science,  or 
English.91  In  Botswana,  theoretical  and  practi-
cal knowledge of the job, as well as other job- 
specific  skills,  are  generally  considered  to  be 
less important than skills such as commitment, 
communication,  and  basic  problem-solving.92 
In Peru, 40 percent of employers complain about 
the lack of dependable work ethics and personal 
qualities such as team work, persistency, ability 
to  reach  consensus,  or  initiative  among  their 
employees.  This  subjective  assessment  is  con-
firmed by harder evidence showing that returns 
to the socioemotional trait of perseverance are 
as high as returns to average cognitive ability.93

Learning through jobs

Just as skills are important for jobs, the reverse is 
true as well. Many technical and social skills can 
be built through experience in the workplace—
shaping skills on the job carries sizable returns. 
On average across countries, the return to one 
additional year of work experience in nonagri-
cultural activities is roughly one-half the return 
to  one  additional  year  of  education  at  the  be-
ginning of work life.94 And managers put a pre-
mium on experience. In five African countries, 
managers  identified  work  experience  as  more 
important  for  hiring  decisions  than  technical 
skills and education.95

Apprenticeship programs, fostering the in-
tegration  of  education  and  learning  through 
jobs, exist in various shapes around the world. 
They range from the informal model of Sub-
Saharan  Africa  to  the  dual  model  of  Central 
Europe.  Informal  apprenticeship,  often  the 
primary  mechanism  for  technical  skills  to  be 
passed  through  generations,  can  be  strength-
ened  through  its  gradual  integration  into  na-
tional training systems.96 

The dual model, deeply rooted in Germany, 
combines  classroom-based  schooling—geared 
to building general and transferable skills—with 
learning on the job in the training company.97

BOX 5.8    Manpower planning has given way to dynamic skills development

Manpower  planning,  a  technique  that  used  macroeconomic  and 
sector forecasts to derive how many workers with specific technical 
skills would be needed was popular in the 1960s and 1970s. It was 
successful in a few cases in which it was closely integrated with the 
overall economic development strategy of the country and bene-
fited from a universal basic education system, as it did in the Repub-
lic of Korea.a But its rigidity soon became stifling. Manpower plan-
ning  generally  assumed  a  fixed  relationship  between  labor  and 
outputs, implicitly ruling out technological change. It also empha-
sized technical skills to the detriment of cognitive and social skills. 
And  it  was  slow  to  adapt  to  rapid  changes  in  the  world  of  work 
brought by globalization.b

Gradually the focus shifted from merely ensuring an adequate 
supply  of  skills  to  delivering  demand-responsive,  quality-skills 
development programs. The Republic of Korea stopped developing 
long-term macroeconomic plans with explicit industrial policies by 
the  mid-1990s.  Industrial  projections  of  manpower  supply  took  a 
backseat to the country’s new initiatives emphasizing quality and 
relevance of education and skills development.c The scope became 
broader and more integrated, replacing mechanistic forecasting. In 
the 1980s and 1990s, Singapore developed an integrated strategy 
to upgrade, retrain, and provide lifelong learning for its labor force, 
especially for those with lower levels of education and skills.

The rapid pace of globalization increasingly requires the private 
sector to be a driving force in skills development. India’s National 

Association of Software and Service Companies (NASSCOM) devel-
oped  standardized  skills  assessments  and  certification  arrange-
ments in 2006. The Korea University of Technology and Education 
(KUT)  established  the  Bridge  Model,  a  three-way  partnership  also 
involving a single major enterprise and clusters of small and medium 
enterprises (SMEs) that serve as its main subcontractors. The major 
enterprise contributes technical knowledge, the SMEs bring in the 
employees  to  be  trained,  and  KUT  supplies  the  teaching  facilities 
and  content.d Samsung  was  the  first  “bridge’”  in  2006;  five  other 
major companies have become bridges since then. 

Much  can  be  learned  from  comprehensive  skill-building  sys-
tems, especially from those of East Asia. But these systems require 
sophisticated institutional mechanisms that may be out of reach in 
lower-capacity  contexts.e  Over  100  countries  have  embarked  on 
comprehensive  National  Qualification  Frameworks,  built  around 
the definition of competencies, certification, and accreditation. But 
with  exceptions,  results  and  impact  are  sobering.f  Often,  the 
administrative capacity available in low- and middle-income coun-
tries  is  overwhelmed,  and  progress  is  held  back  by  the  lack  of 
strong buy-in from the most important players: parents, teachers, 
training  institutes,  and  firms.  Perhaps  the  most  valuable  lesson 
from East Asian countries is that skills-development systems need 
to grow organically from below while being coordinated and fos-
tered from above.

dual system is credited with fast and structured 
employment integration.98 But the dual system 
requires  more  than  the  right  economic  incen-
tives—it  is  based  on  a  social  contract  between 
employers (to offer places and invest in the fu-
ture  career  of  apprentice  as  a  common  good), 
trade unions (to accept below minimum wage 
payment for trainees), and government (to fund 
vocational  schools  and  provide  quality  con-
trol).99  Private  sector  commitment,  including 
financing of training and continuation even in 
times of economic downturns, is fundamental. 
Given such high institutional requirements, at-
tempts  to  transplant  the  dual  model  in  its  en-
tirety have seen little success. 

Building  skills  on  the  job  is  promising,  be-
cause skills continue to develop and accumulate 
after formal schooling ends, in teenage years and 
during  working  life.100  Jobs—especially  early 

experiences—can also shape behaviors and at-
titudes, including the willingness to contribute 
to society at large.

Importantly, jobs also support the transmis-
sion  of  knowledge  through  interactions  with 
other people. Knowledge spillovers underlie the 
agglomeration effects observed in cities and in 
production clusters.101 But knowledge spillovers 
from jobs also occur in rural areas. During the 
Green Revolution in India, farmers with experi-
enced neighbors made larger profits than those 
with inexperienced ones.102 Benefits from social 
learning at the village level were substantial.103

Jobs  can  also  ignite  skills  building  by  put-
ting  people  in  contact  with  the  outside  world. 
Working  in  foreign-owned  companies,  or  in 
firms  integrated  in  international  value  chains, 
allows  the  acquisition  of  new  technical  and 
managerial skills. This learning then spurs imi-

tation and can have cascading ripple effects.104 
In  Singapore,  India’s  Tata  group  was  the  first 
international company to partner with the Eco-
nomic Development Board in 1972 to establish 
a company-owned training center for precision 
engineers. This partnership model was success-
fully  replicated  in  subsequent  years  with  other 
foreign  companies,  eventually  leading  to  the 
consolidation of various institutions in 1993 to 
form  Singapore’s  Nanyang  Polytechnic.  Today, 
the  polytechnic  has  become  a  source  of  inter-
national  expertise  on  industry-led  training.105 
Intel’s  decision  to  establish  its  semiconductor 
assembly and test plant in Costa Rica has equally 
contributed significantly to that country’s pros-
pects and skill building system.106

Jobs need skills, pull skills, and build skills

Some skills are necessary for productive employ-
ment to emerge in the first place. And they cannot 
be acquired on the job. Without numeracy and 
literacy skills, the prospects of improving employ-
ment  opportunities  and  earnings,  whether  
in agriculture or in urban settings, are thin. To-
day,  more  than  one-tenth  of  15-to-24-year-olds 
worldwide  are  functionally  illiterate,  and  that 
does not bode well for their future.107 Also, social 
skills  assume  an  ever  more  important  role  as 
complements to basic cognitive skills. Given that 
skill building is cumulative, securing the founda-
tion on which much of the later path of skill ac-
quisition  follows  remains  an  absolute  priority. 
Many countries are not there yet. 

With this foundation in place, jobs can pull 
skills.  Employment  opportunities  increase  the 
demand for education, which systems then have 

to meet. The role of policy here is to ensure that 
signals  are  adequately  transmitted,  providing 
incentives to continue skill accumulation by the 
young  and  those  of  working  age  alike.  In  the 
Dominican  Republic,  providing  students  with 
information about the actual returns to second-
ary school education led to substantially higher 
school attendance.108 In India, informing rural 
women about job opportunities led to increased 
schooling  for  girls  and  delayed  marriage  and 
childbearing for women.109 On the other hand, 
privilege in access to jobs distorts the signals. It 
hurts and discourages, rather than encourages, 
the building of skills.

Jobs themselves can build skills, especially at 
entry into the labor market. Given the negative 
long-term  effects  of  troubled  school-to-work 
transitions,  placing  emphasis  on  supporting 
first-time  job-seekers  should  have  significant 
payoffs. 

But  jobs  may  neither  pull  nor  build  skills 
to  a  significant  degree,  even  if  the  founda-
tional  cognitive  skills  are  in  place.  This  occurs 
in  situations  where  the  benefits  from  agglom-
eration  and  global  integration  are  present  but  
not adequately exploited. Countries undergoing 
rapid urbanization often have sizable knowledge 
spillovers  to reap but may fail to  move up the 
value-added ladder. If so, they can be caught in 
traps of low productivity and low skills.110 Such 
traps arise when skills are insufficient to spur in-
novation  and  the  demand  for  skills  is  too  low 
to  encourage  their  acquisition.  In  those  cases, 
more relevant schooling and skill building at the 
secondary, technical, and likely higher levels are 
needed as a prerequisite for the creation of good 
jobs for development.

and  the  Inter-American  Convention  on  Hu-
man  Rights.  Each  of  these  provides  explicit 
protections  for  a  range  of  labor  rights. At  the 
national level, countries include workers’ rights 
in constitutions, national laws, and regulations. 
National laws clarify details on specific interpre-
tations and applications of international rights 
and standards.

  6.  The core international labor standards are the 
subject of eight conventions covering the four 
areas:  Convention  87  (1948),  the  Freedom  of 
Association and Protection of the Right to Or-
ganize Convention; Convention 98 (1949), the 
Right  to  Organize  and  Collective  Bargaining 
Convention; Convention 29 (1930), the Forced 
Labor  Convention;  Convention  105  (1957), 
the  Abolition  of  Forced  Labor  Convention; 
Convention  100  (1951),  the  Equal  Remunera-
tion  Convention;  Convention  111  (1958),  the 
Discrimination  (Employment  and  Occupa-
tion) Convention; Convention 138 (1973), the 
Minimum  Age  Convention;  and  Convention 
182  (1999),  the  Worst  Forms  of  Child  Labor 
Convention.  See  “Conventions,”  NORMLEx 
(Information  System  on  International  Labour 
Standards)  database,  International  Labour  
Organization, Geneva, http://www.ilo.org/dyn/
normlex/en/.

  7.  For  example,  Convention  122  covers  employ-
ment policy, Conventions 81 and 129 address la-
bour inspections (129 for agriculture), and Con-
vention 144 involves tripartite consultations.

  8.  ILO 1998.

  9.  Hassel 2008. For example, the safeguard policies 
of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) 
are  aligned  with  the  core  labor  standards.  See 
IFC 2012.

10.  In  theory,  freedom  of  association  provides  a 
channel  for  workers  to  demand  better  work-
ing conditions. Safety and health are covered by 
ILO conventions, national laws, and regulations 
and an increasing number of voluntary private 
sector codes of conduct.

Cities  have  pecuniary  costs,  such  as  higher 
prices  for  housing,  and  nonpecuniary  costs, 
such as worse pollution and more crime. Costs 
of living also increase with city size. Emerging 
evidence  from  industrial  countries  also  shows 
a wage growth effect, and not only a level effect, 
in larger cities. See Freedman 2008; Holmlund 
and Storrie 2002; Wheeler 2006.

Employed  are  considered  overqualified  if  their 
education  (years  of  schooling)  is  one  standard 
deviation  above  the  mean  observed  for  the  re-
spective occupation; they are considered under-
qualified if their education is one standard devia-
tion  below  the  mean  observed  per  occupation. 
The  two-digit  ILO  definition  of  occupations  is 
used.

76.  This is a comparison of relative constraints. For 
each country, the percentage of firms that rate 
skills  to  be  a  severe  or  very  severe  constraint 
is divided by the average of such rating for all 
other obstacles. This allows for a cross-country 
comparison independent of the level of the sub-
jective answers. 

77.  Estimating the conditional correlation between 
the  relative  skill  constraint  and  a  number  of 
variables using the World Bank’s enterprise sur-
veys  for  105  countries,  one  finds  a  significant

Cameroon, Cape Verde, the Democratic Repub-
lic of Congo, the Arab Republic of Egypt, Mali, 
and Nepal. Firm owners are asked to single out 
the most important obstacle to operating their 
business, with the number of obstacles varying 
by  survey.  The  highest  percentage  is  recorded 
in Egypt, where 6 percent of firm owners chose 
skills as the most important obstacle of a total of 
21 choices; the lowest was in Afghanistan, where 
5 percent of firm owners named skills among 12 
obstacles. Rural investment climate assessments 
were  made  in  Benin,  Burkina  Faso,  Ethiopia, 
Indonesia,  Mozambique,  Nigeria, Tanzania,  Sri 
Lanka, and the Republic of Yemen and returned 
similar  results  as  to  the  importance  of  skills 
(Sawada 2011).

88.  No golden rule exists about how many second-
ary students should be in the vocational branch. 
Most  advanced  countries,  with  stronger  de-
mands—and  rewards—for  specific  technical 

skills, have between 40 and 50 percent of their 
students in the vocational track. In the develop-
ing world, the average is about 33 percent based 
on  UNESCO  statistics  (http://www.uis.unesco 
.org/Pages/default.aspx).

89.  See Tan and Nam (2012). For advanced coun-
tries, on average, the employability of students 
graduating from TVE is similar to that of stu-
dents’ graduating from general tracks, but they 
earn somewhat lower incomes.

given  four  choices  from  which  to  choose  the 
biggest  bottleneck  to  hiring:  education  (a 
school-leaving  certificate  or  degree);  technical 
skills (for instance, welding or accounting) not 
necessarily  taught  at  school;  social  skills  (for 
instance, attitude, workplace behavior, arriving 
on time, trustworthiness); or work experience.
96.  ILO 2011b; Nübler 2008. The ILO has also con-

moto and Elder (2010). 

97.  Biavaschi  and  others  2012  for  the  World  De-

many,  the  initial  transition  does  not  hinge  on 
finding employment in the training firm. Even 
though training and on-the-job learning takes 
place in a specific firm, skills learned  appear to 
be transferable (Winkelmann 1996).

poor youths (16 and 29 years of age who had 
not  completed  secondary  school)  show  sig-
nificant results. For young female participants, 
pregnancy  rates  are  down  and  employment 
chances up. For both women and men, job sat-
isfaction  and  aspirations  improved  markedly 
(Ibarraran and others 2012).

overs exist through jobs whose holders have a 
higher education degree (which is a proxy for 
advanced skills). One additional year of college 
education per worker is associated with a spill-
over—in addition to the effect on the student’s 
income and employment chances—of increas-
ing the respective state’s productivity growth by 
6 to 9 percent. See also Ciccone and Peri 2006;

Diverse jobs agendas

Countries differ in where the development payoffs from jobs are greatest. 
These payoffs depend on the country’s level of development, demography, 
endowments, and institutions.

Countries face different jobs challenges as 

they move along the development path. 
In  agrarian  economies,  most  people  are 
still engaged in agriculture and urbanization has 
not  yet  picked  up.  In  urbanizing  countries,  pro-
ductivity growth in agriculture has risen enough 
to free up large numbers of people to work in cit-
ies. Formalizing countries generally have more de-
veloped economies, where the coverage of social 
protection  systems  is  large  enough  to  envision 
extending it to the entire workforce. 

In  some  countries,  the  jobs  challenge  is 
shaped  by  demography  with  special  circum-
stances  affecting  particular  groups.  In  coun-
tries with high youth unemployment, prolonged 
joblessness  and  idleness  affect  large  numbers 
of young people, with many seeing limited op-
portunities  for  the  future.  Aging  societies  also 
face generational issues, but these stem from a 
decreasing share of the working age population 
and  increasing  costs  related  to  providing  and 
caring for a growing number of old people. 

Natural endowments, including geography, 
can  create  unique  jobs  challenges.  Resource-
rich countries may have substantial foreign ex-
change earnings, but this wealth often does not 
translate  into  employment  creation  beyond 
the exploitation of the natural resources. Small 
island  nations  cannot  reap  the  benefits  from 
agglomeration and global integration because 
of  the  size  of  the  population  and  geographic 
remoteness.

Finally, the strength of institutions can define 
a  country’s  jobs  challenge.  In  conflict-affected 
countries, institutions are fragile, private invest-
ment is largely out of reach for the time being, 
and restoring social cohesion through jobs takes 
on particular importance.

These  criteria  are  not  mutually  exclusive. A 
country may be both resource rich and conflict 
affected,  or  it  may  belong  to  the  formalizing 
group and be characterized by high youth un-
employment. Still, focusing on the key features 
associated  with  each  type  of  country  situation 
helps  to  clarify  which  jobs  would  make  the 
greatest contribution to development in a par-
ticular context. This allows for a richer analysis 
of  the  potential  tradeoffs  among  living  stan-
dards,  productivity,  and  social  cohesion  in  a 
specific country situation. And it provides clues 
about the nature of the obstacles to job creation 
and how they can be removed (question 6). 

Agrarian economies

In  countries  where  a  majority  of  the  popula-
tion lives in rural areas, wage employment is not 
the prevalent form of work. For instance, about 
half of the employed population in Kenya is en-
gaged in farming, whereas self-employment in 
nonagricultural household businesses and wage 
employment in informal enterprises account for 
slightly more than one-third.1

 

Diverse jobs agendas

Formal employment, including wage labor-
ers  in  registered  private  enterprises  and  the 
entire  public  sector,  typically  accounts  for  less 
than 10 percent of total employment in agrarian 
economies.  The  share  of  wage  employment  in 
manufacturing is much smaller. A comparison 
across  several  French-speaking  Sub-Saharan 
 African countries puts the fraction at less than 5 
percent of total employment even in the capital 
cities—less than 3 percent in Cotonou and Lomé 
to 8 percent in Yaoundé; only Antananarivo has 
more than 10 percent.2 Across Sub-Saharan Af-
rica, one-quarter or less of formal sector work-
ers are women; only in Senegal does the fraction 
exceed  one-third.3 If  anything,  employment  in 
the  formal  sector  has  trended  downward  over 
the past two decades as state-owned enterprises 
have been privatized and foreign trade has been 
liberalized. 

In this context, the notion of unemployment 
needs  to  be  interpreted  with  caution.  Unem-
ployment  rates  can  technically  be  computed, 
but given the prevalence of poverty in agrarian 
economies, a substantive share of the labor force 
is  unlikely  to  remain  idle  for  long.  Underem-
ployment  and  low  earnings,  rather  than  open 
unemployment, are the challenges most people 
face  in  agrarian  economies.  Household  survey 
data from Mozambique show that an astound-
ing 81 percent of those at work were living on 
less than US$1.25 a day in 2003, and 95 percent 
were living on less than US$2.00 a day.4

In agrarian economies, the main avenues to 
improving  living  standards  involve  increasing 
productivity  in  farming,  creating  a  dynamic 
economic  environment  in  cities,  and  promot-
ing labor reallocation from rural to urban areas, 
thereby  sparking  a  positive  spiral  of  produc-
tivity  growth  and  improvement  in  living  stan-
dards. Together, these approaches should lead to 
the expansion of off-farm employment oppor-
tunities, which are in turn an important driver 
of poverty reduction.

Mozambique  illustrates  the  jobs  challenges 
faced  by  agrarian  economies.5  Thanks  to  im-
portant mining discoveries and a commodities 
boom, as well as Maputo’s privileged position as 
one of the ports closest to Johannesburg, Mo-
zambique has had one of the best growth per-
formances in Sub-Saharan Africa over the past 
decade. Yet, after falling substantially during the 
1990s, probably as a consequence of the end of 

the civil war, the poverty rate remained basically 
unchanged between 2003 and 2008, at around 
55 percent of the total population.6

Agriculture is the locus of much of Mozam-
bique’s poverty. Over 80 percent of employment 
is in agriculture, yet the sector accounts for only 
30  percent  of  gross  domestic  product  (GDP).7 
Value added per hour worked in agriculture is 
one-seventh  that  of  services  and  one-twelfth 
that  of  manufacturing.  Yields  have  been  stag-
nant over the past decade. About 95 percent of 
agricultural  workers  work  on  small  plots,  the 
use of modern technology is low, and access to 
extension services is minimal.

Evidence suggests that growth in agriculture 
delivers more poverty reduction than other sec-
tors  in  lower-income  countries,  because  poor 
people  are  concentrated  in  the  sector  and  be-
cause  they  participate  more  in  the  growth  in 
agriculture than in the growth in other sectors.8 
Since  1700,  virtually  every  example  of  mass 
poverty  reduction  has  actually  begun  with  an 
increase in agricultural productivity.9

Constraints  on  agricultural  growth  vary 
depending  on  the  availability  of  land  relative 
to  the  availability  of  farm  labor.  Compared 
with other areas of the developing world, Sub- 
Saharan Africa was traditionally seen as a conti-
nent of ample land and scarce labor. While that 
may still be true in some areas, it no longer ap-
plies  to  countries  in  the  south  and  east  of  the 
continent.  In  Mozambique,  the  average  farm 
size is less than 1.5 hectares. As the area under 
cultivation  declines  relative  to  the  size  of  the 
population, producing sufficient food becomes 
a major issue unless yield-enhancing technolog-
ical changes take place. In many agrarian econo-
mies in Sub-Saharan Africa, these changes have 
yet to occur. Unlike many parts of Asia, where 
the Green Revolution has increased cereal yield 
and  the  poverty  incidence  has  declined,  cereal 
yield  has  remained  low  and  poverty  incidence 
high  in  these  Sub-Saharan  countries  (figure 
6.1).  Some  Asian  economies,  such  as  Cambo-
dia, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, and 
Myanmar, face similar challenges.

Public sector investments are important driv-
ers  of  productivity  growth  and  intensification 
of smallholder agriculture. Technology is often 
a  public  good.  Because  farmers  can  reproduce 
improved  varieties  of  rice  and  wheat,  private 
seed  companies  cannot  reap  the  benefit  of  in-

troducing new varieties and so tend not to make 
the effort. Hybrid seeds of maize, sorghum, and 
millet  cannot  be  reproduced  by  farmers,  and, 
hence, the private sector supplies seeds. But even 
in  these  cases,  basic  research  is  carried  out  by  
the public sector. As a result, public support is 
necessary  to  develop  biological  and  chemical 
technologies.

These  are  enduring  collaborations  between 
advanced agricultural research centers and na-
tional  programs  in  Sub-Saharan  Africa.  They 
have  developed  improved  varieties  of  cotton 
and  cassava  in  ways  that  are  reminiscent  of 
the  long-term  collaboration  in  rice  and  wheat 
research  between  international  agricultural  re-
search centers and national programs in Asia.10 
The recent surge in the production of high-value 
crops  for  export,  including  in  Mozambique,  is 
also encouraging.11 Aside from these examples, 
however, few improved crops appropriate to the 
African climate have been developed.

Gravity  irrigation  systems  are  a  local  pub-
lic  good  as  well.  Irrigated  land  accounts  for 
only  5  percent  of  the  total  cultivated  area  in 
Sub-Saharan Africa. Lowland rice yields in ir-
rigated areas in Sub-Saharan Africa in general 

and  Mozambique  in  particular  are  compara- 
ble  with  yields  in  Asia.12  In  such  areas,  im- 
proved varieties developed in Asia or crossbred 
with  local  varieties  have  been  adopted.  This 
observation suggests that, as far as lowland rice 
is  concerned,  Asian  technology  could  be  di-
rectly transferred to the irrigated areas of Sub- 
Saharan Africa.

While  the  intensification  of  crop-based  ag-
riculture has been associated with a significant 
increase  in  the  use  of  inorganic  fertilizer,  the 
application of fertilizer per hectare is far lower 
in  Sub-Saharan  Africa  than  in  any  other  re-
gion of the world. One of the major reasons is 
the high fertilizer prices relative to grain prices. 
Fertilizer  prices  are  usually  two  to  three  times 
higher in Sub-Saharan Africa than in Asia and 
Latin  America  because  of  poor  infrastructure 
and trade logistics.13 Another major constraint 
on fertilizer application is the lack of credit for 
smallholders,  given  that  land  ownership  titles 
are  seldom  secured  and  hence  cannot  be  used 
as collateral.14 Therefore, productivity growth in 
agriculture also requires a favorable investment 
climate including improved access to infrastruc-
ture and credit.15 

 

Diverse jobs agendas   

193

The job structure in the cities is dominated 
by  self-employment,  with  petty  commerce 
growing quickly. If agriculture matters most for 
poverty reduction, successful urbanization may 
hold the key to more rapid productivity and in-
come growth as well as social cohesion. In most 
of  Sub-Saharan  Africa,  however,  urbanization 
has failed to create the dynamism observed else-
where in the developing world. Migration from 
rural to urban areas continues, but migrants are 
simply swelling the ranks of the self-employed 
earning subsistence wages. In the absence of dy-
namic cities, migration is driven by despair, and 
not hope. In Mozambique, for example, young 
people are moving to urban areas, but few are 
moving into regular wage employment. Mean-
while,  levels  of  trust  are  falling  and  are  lowest 
among young workers.16

Some  have  argued  that  the  jobs  challenge 
in these urban areas can be addressed through 
the  creation  of  greater  opportunities  for  self-
employment.  For  example,  building  space  for 
informal markets around bus stops would allow 
more rural migrants to make a living. But self-
employment of this sort is unlikely to support 
the agglomeration effects and knowledge spill-
overs that make cities thrive elsewhere. 

An  alternative  approach  is  to  create  condi-
tions  for  labor-intensive  light  manufacturing 

to take off. This approach focuses on identify-
ing activities that may hold latent comparative 
advantage  and  on  removing  the  constraints 
that dissuade private firms from taking up these 
activities.  In  fact,  there  are  many  informal  in-
dustrial clusters in urban areas in Sub-Saharan 
 Africa.  They  produce  garments,  leather  shoes, 
simple  metal  products,  and  furniture,  among 
other things, though seldom for export.17 These 
clusters have spontaneously developed, suggest-
ing a potential comparative advantage in these 
industries.  Reducing  logistics  costs,  removing 
red  tape,  and  addressing  coordination  issues 
could create the necessary conditions to attract 
foreign investors to these clusters, especially at a 
time when wage increases in coastal China are 
encouraging  the  relocation  of  some  industries 
where low labor costs are a key competitive fac-
tor (box 6.1).18 

Jobs,  which  start  to  trigger  agglomeration 
effects  and  make  connections  to  the  global 
economy,  are  good  jobs  for  development  in 
agrarian countries. To create more of these jobs 
and  become  centers  of  economic  dynamism, 
cities  need  to  be  more  functional.  But  even  in 
the most optimistic scenario, it will take time to 
complete  the  urbanization  process,  so  increas-
ing productivity in agriculture is a priority for 
reducing the high poverty levels.

Conflict-affected countries

Jobs are among the most pressing issues in coun-
tries in conflict or emerging from it.19 They are 
critical for restoring the livelihoods of individu-
als  and  families  affected  by  war  and  violence, 
reintegrating ex-combatants, and rebuilding ev-
erybody’s sense of belonging in society. They are 
also key to jump-start economic activity, recon-
nect people, and reconstruct networks and the 
social fabric. Alongside security and justice, jobs 

are central to breaking cycles of violence, restor-
ing confidence in institutions, and giving people 
a stake in society.20 

Yet the obstacles to creating jobs in conflict-
affected  countries  are  staggering  and  confront 
policy  makers  with  overwhelming  questions. 
How  can  jobs  be  generated  quickly  for  demo-
bilized soldiers, displaced persons, and vulner-
able groups affected by violence or war? What 
kinds of government programs can have a quick

BOX 6.1    Can agrarian Ethiopia compete in manufacturing?

The labor productivity of workers in well-managed firms in Ethiopia is compa-
rable  with  that  in  China  and  Vietnam,  although  wages  are  only  a  quarter  of 
those  in  China  and  half  those  in  Vietnam.  Ethiopia  thus  has  the  potential  to 
compete  globally  in  apparel  thanks  to  a  significant  and  growing  labor  cost 
advantage. It is also close to a state-of-the-art and well-located container port 
in Djibouti and has duty-free access to the markets of the European Union and 
the  United  States.  The  binding  constraint  on  Ethiopia’s  competitiveness  in 
apparel is poor trade logistics, which wipe out its labor cost advantage and cut 
the country off from the higher-value time-sensitive segments of the market. 
Establishing a fast-track channel for moving apparel through customs, provid-
ing free and immediate access to foreign exchange, reducing the cost of letters 
of credit, and setting up an industrial zone closer to Djibouti would alleviate the 
most important trade logistics bottlenecks. These steps would also put Ethio-
pia in a position to attract investors to lead the industry in the same way that 
China and Vietnam have done.

Ethiopia also benefits from an abundance of natural resources. Raw materi-
als such as skins for the footwear industry and hard and soft timber for the fur-
niture industry are available. But they are expensive. A cubic meter of timber 
costs US$667, compared to US$344 in China and US$246 at most in Vietnam. So 
urban consumers in Ethiopia buy imported modern furniture, which is cheaper 
and of better quality. Yet Ethiopia has enormous unexploited potential in tim-
ber, particularly bamboo. Reforms could make the country’s furniture industry 
competitive  in  the  domestic  market,  create  more  productive  jobs,  and  save 
 foreign exchange.

BOX 6.2    Conflict can increase labor force participation 

among women

Out of necessity, women often intensify their economic activity during periods 
of  conflict.  Post-conflict  programs  that  target  women  can  help  them  take 
advantage  of  the  window  of  opportunity  presented  by  conflict  and  assume 
new roles that contribute meaningfully to local economic recovery. Women in 
North  Maluku,  Indonesia,  were  active  participants  in  the  rapid  recovery  and 
poverty reduction that occurred in the wake of nearly a year of intensely violent 
civil strife. “Since 2002, when the conflict ended, I have run a retail shop for 
extra income to fulfill our family needs. . . . I received support money that I used 
for my business capital from the Ternate city government. . . . Ten years ago, I 
was only a housewife because I didn’t have the capital to run the business as I 
do now,” a 38-year-old married woman reported.

engine  for  employment  creation?  Moreover, 
countries affected by conflict are often poor to 
begin with. Their opportunities, resources, and 
capacity are scarce; data for planning may sim-
ply not exist.

Conflict  environments  range  from  situa-
tions  with  high  levels  of  criminal  violence  to 

civil wars and other forms of internal conflict. 
Less frequently, they involve hostilities between 
states. When entire countries are affected by in-
ternal or external conflict, the jobs challenge is 
particularly  daunting  because  of  institutional 
breakdown and fractured connectivity with the 
outside world. If conflict is localized, constraints 
are less severe where functioning infrastructure, 
services,  and  institutions  can  be  extended  to 
conflict-affected regions once hostilities become 
manageable.  Conflict  situations  are  generally 
further  complicated  by  large  numbers  of  dis-
placed people. At the end of 2010, an estimated 
15.4 million people sought refuge from conflict 
outside their home countries, and another 27.5 
million were displaced internally.21 

Conflict  can  fundamentally  disrupt  jobs  by 
destroying or damaging infrastructure and ac-
cess to markets, as well as through altering in-
centives. In Sri Lanka, conflict in the north dis-
rupted economic activity and created favorable 
conditions for the insurgency to recruit among 
the newly unemployed.22

Even during war, however, people work. Jobs 
disproportionately  involve  low-pay  or  unpaid 
work,  such  as  subsistence  agriculture  or  petty 
trading.  Youth  in  rural  areas  in  post-conflict 
Liberia  reported  working  two  to  four  jobs  at  a 
time.23  Across  countries,  conflict  increases  fe -
male labor force participation, as women work to 
help their households cope with income shocks 
and to compensate for the absence of men who 
are  fighting  (box  6.2).24  In Afghanistan,  female 
employment  rates  were  higher  in  high-conflict 
than  in  low-conflict  areas;  in  Nepal,  they  in-
creased more than in high-conflict areas.25 

Some jobs in conflict-affected countries may 
involve illegal activities that persist in the after-
math  of  conflict  because  of  weak  governance 
and  lack  of  legal  alternatives.  Even  if  these  ac-
tivities  are  limited  in  scope,  they  may  under-
mine the creation of good jobs for development 
by  distorting  incentives  and  generating  rents. 
In Afghanistan, poppy cultivation is an impor-
tant source of income for rural households.26 In 
Somalia,  piracy  creates  jobs  for  some  through 
the  employment  of  speed  boat  crews  and  re-
lated land-based operations.27 In Liberia, young 
people  in  rural  areas  have  supplemented  their 
income  by  working  in  illegal  mining,  rubber 
tapping, and logging.28

Jobs  are  central  to  recovery  in  countries 
emerging from conflict, but the barriers to job

creation can be especially steep (box 6.3). Firms 
in  conflict-affected  countries  report  that  po-
litical  instability  is  the  most  severe  bottleneck 
to  business  followed  by  the  lack  of  electricity 
(figure  6.2).  Simply  getting  basic  services  up 
and running can be a major issue. Corruption 
and the lack of finance are also among the top 
constraints. Security risks because of high crime 
rates  or  armed  conflict  reduce  returns  to  in-
vestment and can persist even after the armed 
conflict has officially ended. Firms may need ad-
ditional funds to hire private security or to pay 
bribes.  The  loss  of  skills  because  of  migration 
and disruptions in schooling can also create ob-
stacles for firms.

Demobilization  and  reintegration  of  former 
combatants  are  major  challenges  for  countries 
emerging from conflict. Although ex-combatants 
make  up  a  relatively  small  share  of  the  total 
population,  unemployment  and  idleness,  par-
ticularly  of  young  men,  are  stress  factors  that 
can  strain  and  potentially  undermine  fragile 
post-conflict environments.29 Jobs can compen-
sate for the loss of identity and status associated 
with the dissolution of armed forces and militias 
and the income lost from theft and looting. Jobs 
can also help deter further involvement in gangs 
and violence. Yet not all jobs are alternatives to 
violence, especially if they provide little income 
and the work is drudgery. 

Most  disarmament,  demobilization,  and 
reintegration  programs  include  some  form  of 
employment  support  such  as  emergency  tem-
porary jobs, cash for work, public employment 
services,  small  grants,  or  vocational  training. 
Temporary  employment  programs  can  play 
an  important  bridging  role  by  providing  jobs 
quickly to ex-combatants and other vulnerable 
populations in the absence of other options. Ev-
idence on whether temporary programs reduce 
conflict and contribute to rebuilding communi-
ties is less clear. Cash-for-work programs can be 
costly and may strain stretched public budgets, 
may  create  poor  quality  and  unsustainable  as-
sets, and can be divisive and lead to tensions if 
they are targeted only at certain groups. 

Broadly  targeted  community-based  pro-
grams  may  be  more  conducive  to  stability.  In  
the Democratic Republic of Congo, where many 
ex-combatants have had a difficult time finding 
jobs,  associations  of  ex-combatants  and  com-
munity members share information about em-
ployment opportunities and social support and 

BOX 6.3    Solving jobs challenges is urgent in South Sudan 

The  Republic  of  South  Sudan,  the  world’s  newest  country,  exemplifies  the  
challenges  countries  face  emerging  from  conflict.  South  Sudan  has  natural 
resources, including oil, yet more than four-fifths of the population lives in rural 
areas, and most depend on subsistence farming and cattle raising. Half of the 
population lives in poverty, which is especially deep in rural areas, according to 
the  2009  household  survey.  Only  slightly  more  than  one-fourth  of  the  adult 
population is literate, and prospects for future human capital development are 
dim: almost half of 10- to 14-year-olds are working, with only slightly more than 
one-third in school.a

The International Organization for Migration estimates that 4 million peo-
ple were displaced during the Sudanese civil war, and that nearly 1.9 million 
have  returned  since  the  signing  of  the  Comprehensive  Peace  Agreement  in 
2005.b The return of internally displaced persons creates substantial pressures 
on already poor communities. The new government of South Sudan is aiming 
to demobilize 150,000 soldiers over the next six to eight years.c Access to land 
rights and conflict among nomadic groups are also notable challenges for jobs, 
as is the legacy of overemployment in the public sector, which is not sustain-
able given severe fiscal pressures.

Creating jobs is one of the most immediate concerns facing the new gov-
ernment—jobs that can contribute to peace and stability, provide sustainable 
living  standards  through  legal  and  nonviolent  activity,  and  foster  economic 
recovery. Generating these jobs involves building an enabling environment for 
private  sector  investment.  That  will  take  time,  however,  and  alternatives  are 
urgently needed for groups whose lack of jobs can threaten stability, including  
internally displaced persons, ex-combatants, and youth.

also  help  manage  disputes.30  Programs  can  be 
tailored to facilitate the reintegration of youth, 
particularly young men, who have been involved 
in  conflict.  In  some  cases,  such  as  the  Demo-
cratic  Republic  of  Congo,  Liberia,  and  Sierra 
 Leone,  young  ex-combatants  have  no  memory 
of peaceful times or normal civilian life. 

Ultimately,  conflict-affected  countries  need 
to attract private investment. The state can play 
an  enabling  role  by  strengthening  regulations 
and  institutions,  rebuilding  basic  infrastruc-
ture,  and  providing  security.31  Partnerships 
between the public and private sectors, donors, 
and  civil  society  can  help  to  rebuild  markets 
and  investor  confidence.  Connecting  farmers 
and  entrepreneurs  through  value  chains  has 
the potential to spark innovation and employ-
ment growth.32 Business associations can sup-
port entrepreneurship and help solve collective 
action  problems  by  restoring  law  and  order, 
roads, and electricity.33 As security is restored,

however, the jobs focus can shift from targeted 
public programs to employment creation in the 
private sector. But it would be naïve to expect 
conflict-affected countries to become dynamic 
economies overnight.

Tackling  the  jobs  challenge  faced  by  con-
flict-affected  countries  is  a  formidable  task:  it 
requires creating jobs that contribute to peace 
and  stability,  that  are  an  alternative  to  illegal 

economic  activity  and  violence,  and  that  start 
the  long  process  of  economic  recovery.  In 
conflict  settings,  jobs  can  also  have  develop-
ment  payoffs  for  social  cohesion  by  involving 
people in productive activities that strengthen 
self-esteem  and  give  them  a  sense  of  identity 
and status, by rebuilding networks, and by giv-
ing people a sense that opportunities are fairly 
distributed.

Urbanizing countries

Urbanizing  countries  endowed  with  abundant 
unskilled labor have the potential to enter a vir-
tuous jobs circle. The integration of these coun-
tries into the world economy can lead to the cre-
ation  of  extensive  employment  opportunities, 
especially  in  light  manufacturing.  These  jobs 
may involve hard work, relatively low pay, and 
limited or negligible benefits, but in general they 
are  preferable  to  jobs  in  agriculture.  They  can 
also be the entry point to a process of economic 
and technological upgrading that leads to better 
jobs  in  the  future.34  Employment  opportuni-
ties for the unskilled thus provide avenues out 
of poverty for large numbers of households. In 
countries  in  which  women’s  jobs  choices  have 
been  restricted,  new  employment  opportuni-
ties  in  urbanizing  economies  can  bring  about 
important changes at the household and society 
levels. 

This has been the story of several East Asian 
countries over the past half century. In many re-
spects, it has also been the recent story of Ban-
gladesh,  where  industrialization  is  growing  in 
large cities such as Chittagong and Dhaka. The 
industrial  sector  now  accounts  for  nearly  30 
percent  of  value  added,  up  from  20  percent  in 
1990, and the urbanization rate is approaching 
30 percent, double what is was in 1980.35 Exports 
as  a  percentage  of  GDP  tripled  between  1990 
and 2010, with much of the increase in a thriv-
ing ready-made garment industry that is highly 
intensive in female labor. This structural trans-
formation, along with improvements in agricul-
tural  productivity,  has  had  a  major  impact  on 
living standards. GDP per capita has doubled in 
the past two decades and the share of the popula-
tion living below US$1.25 a day fell from 70 per-
cent in 1992 to 43 percent in 2010.36 Productivity 
and earnings growth still lag behind some of its 
neighbors, but Bangladesh’s story is remarkable 
because the country was often held out in the de-
velopment literature as a hopeless case (box 6.4).
These successes have been built on modern-
ization  in  the  agricultural  sector,  an  industrial 
sector  able  to  absorb  low-skilled  surplus  farm 
labor, and supportive social policies.

Faster  technology  adoption  has  led  to  pro-
ductivity increases in agriculture. Farmers have 
shifted  from  growing  low-yield,  single-crop, 
deep-water  rice  to  double  cropping  of  short-

maturity,  high-yield  rice.  There  has  also  been 
a  pronounced  shift  away  from  sharecropping 
into fixed-rent leasehold tenancy. Landless and 
marginal  farmers  have  been  the  major  ben-
eficiaries  of  this  change.  Simultaneously,  credit 
constraints  have  been  relaxed  thanks  to  the 
country’s well-known microfinance institutions. 
Access  to  finance  has  facilitated  human  capital 
accumulation,  especially  in  women’s  educa-
tion  and  health,  and  promoted  investments  in 
microenterprises.

Despite  the  still  considerable  labor  surplus 
in  rural  areas,  real  wages  in  agriculture  have 
increased from the monetary equivalent of less 
than 2.5 kilograms of rice a day in 1983 to more 
than 6.0 kilograms today. The seasonal hunger 
associated  with  the  monga  period—between 
transplanting  and  harvesting  paddy—is  reced-
ing. Remittances from women working in fac-
tories  and  from  men  working  in  construction 
have also helped reduce rural poverty. 

The movement of labor out of agriculture has 
been facilitated by close urban proximity, result-
ing from Bangladesh’s high population density. 
Special links allowed by proximity also may have 
supported productivity growth among laborers 
engaged  in  rural  nonfarm  sectors.  The  ready-

BOX 6.4   Development pessimism about Bangladesh was 
understandable, but has been proven wrong 

In 1975, the first book on the economy of Bangladesh commented: “If the prob-
lem of Bangladesh can be solved, there can be reasonable confidence that less 
difficult problems of development can also be solved. It is in this sense that 
Bangladesh is to be regarded as the test case of development.”a In the same 
spirit, a well-known study on famines concluded that Bangladesh was “below 
poverty equilibrium.”b

Such  a  negative  perception  of  the  viability  of  the  Bangladesh  economy  
was  conditioned  by  the  adverse  initial  conditions  facing  the  country  after 
 independence—high  population  density,  a  limited  natural-resource  base, 
underdeveloped 
infrastructure,  frequent  natural  disasters,  and  political 
uncertainty.

This negative perception has given way to optimism in global development 
circles because of Bangladesh’s positive record of socioeconomic development 
in recent decades. Some countries have done well in human development indi-
cators, and others have done well in economic growth, but Bangladesh belongs 
to a rather small group of countries that have done well on both fronts, the ini-
tial pessimism notwithstanding. This is the crux of the surprise.

made garment industry has been an important 
part of the jobs story in urbanizing Bangladesh. 
About  3  million  women  are  working  in  this 
sector,  which  has  a  strong  export  orientation. 
Construction has been an important employer 
for men moving out of rural agriculture. Many 
low-skilled workers go abroad as well, especially 
to the Gulf countries. Remittances are growing 
by about 10 percent every year.37 

Light manufacturing opens up opportunities 
for large numbers of workers in urbanizing econ-
omies  because  skill  requirements  are  modest. 
Firms demand some education but it is generally 
limited. In Bangladesh, for instance, 87 percent 
of regular urban wage workers in 2005 had some 
education  but  only  28  percent  had  secondary 
schooling or more.38 These education levels are 
considerably  higher,  though,  than  the  educa-
tional  attainment  of  workers  in  agriculture,  so 
opportunities in the garment industry stimulate 
schooling, especially for girls. Urbanization has 
other beneficial effects on women, as well. Grow-
ing labor earnings increase the opportunity cost 
of raising children, which, in turn, may raise the 
age  of  marriage  and  reduce  the  birth  rate.  To 
the extent that women’s educational attainment 
and labor market participation rise, the status of 
women in society is enhanced. 

BOX 6.5  The entrepreneurs of Bangladesh are local

The ready-made garment industry in Bangladesh has grown rapidly over the 
past  three  decades,  and  the  country  now  ranks  among  the  largest  garment 
exporters in the world. While the early successes have been attributed to an 
initial technology transfer from the Republic of Korea, such a one-time infusion 
of  knowledge  alone  is  insufficient  to  explain  the  sustained  growth.  In  this 
respect, the pattern of development in Bangladesh is similar to that in East Asia, 
where investment in human capital and the importation and assimilation of 
technological and managerial knowledge from advanced countries played a 
critical role in promoting industrialization.

Primary data collected from knitwear manufacturers and garment traders 
can  be  used  to  explore  the  process  of  the  continuous  learning  of  advanced 
skills and expertise. The data show that the initial infusion of specific human 
capital attracted highly educated entrepreneurs to the industry, that the divi-
sion of labor between manufacturers and traders facilitated the expansion of 
the industry, and that enterprise growth has endured because of the continu-
ous learning from abroad by the highly educated entrepreneurs. These factors, 
taken together, account for the high profitability of garment manufacturing in 
Bangladesh.

Sources: Mottaleb and Sonobe 2011; Sonobe and Otsuka 2006.

On the social policy front, both governmen-
tal and nongovernmental organizations have es-
tablished pro-poor, pro-youth, and pro-women 
programs.  These  have  been  instrumental  in 
reducing  population  growth  and  encouraging 
more effective public and private investments in 
education and health. 

Agricultural  modernization,  labor  migra-
tion,  and  social  policies  have  altered  the  jobs 
landscape  of  Bangladesh,  but  these  trans-
formations  have  not  involved  a  substantial 
formalization  of  the  economy.  The  share  of 
jobs  benefitting  from  legal  protection  or  so-
cial insurance has not increased much over the 
past decade. The booming construction sector 
remains  largely  informal.  Corporate  social  re-
sponsibility  among  export-oriented  corpora-
tions in Bangladesh is making some difference 
in the ready-made garment sector, but worker 
unrest has been recurrent. But corporate social 
responsibility is mainly associated with exports 
to  industrial  countries  and  may  become  less 
relevant  if  the  sector  diversifies  its  exports  to 
other  developing  countries.  Corporate  social 
responsibility is unlikely to be a workable op-
tion  in  construction.  But  while  formalization 
has  not  advanced,  the  development  of  entre-
preneurship  has  been  remarkable,  leading  to 
the creation of thousands of nationally owned 
medium and large firms within a mere two de-
cades (box 6.5). 

Bangladesh stands out as an intriguing case 
that is important to understand, especially given 
its starting point. The government has provided 
some  support,  with  export  processing  zones, 
bonded  warehouses,  and  special  treatment  of 
garments at ports. Large infrastructure projects, 
such as the Jamuna Bridge linking the prosper-
ous  eastern  and  lagging  western  regions,  have 
made it easier to move around the country. But 
government  has  not  played  the  leading  role  in 
the  transformation.  Corruption  is  a  problem 
and the cost of doing business is high. Power fail-
ures are frequent, many roads are unpaved, and 
those  that  are  paved  are  highly  congested.  De-
spite these obstacles, agricultural modernization 
has  occurred  thanks  to  the  Green  Revolution  
associated  with  the  development  and  diffusion 
of  high-yielding  varieties  of  rice  and  access  to 
finance.  Labor  has  moved  out  of  agriculture 
through  industrialization,  and  social  policies

have  been  supportive  through  family  planning 
and social protection.

Urbanizing  countries  like  Bangladesh  have 
the potential to exploit several spillovers. But a 
key challenge for them is to find a way to move 
up the value-added chain and diversify manu-
facturing exports. Apart from ready-made gar-
ments, few sectors have grown substantially in 

Bangladesh.39  The  pharmaceutical 
industry 
has developed, and the different pattern of de-
velopment there relative to that of the garment 
industry  is  intriguing.  But  the  high  skill  levels 
required by the pharmaceutical sector and other 
higher  value-added  export  sectors  are  unlikely 
to make them a source of jobs for the masses of 
youth with only primary education.

Resource-rich countries

Investments  in  extractive  industries  can  repre-
sent a sizable fraction of a developing country’s 
GDP and lead to spectacular increases in export 
revenue, but they do not create many jobs. The 
number of people at work during the construc-
tion phase may be sufficient to generate dyna-
mism at the local level, but once the mines and 
fields are in operation, employment goes down 
dramatically. Perhaps the most extreme example 
is  the  liquid  natural  gas  project  in  Papua  New 
Guinea. The investment cost of the project ex-
ceeded twice the country’s GDP at project start-
up,  and  the  project  may  lead  to  double-digit 
growth  rates  for  many  years.  But  it  is  unlikely 
to generate more than 1,000 direct jobs in the 
longer term (table 6.1).

Links to the rest of the economy tend to be 
weak as well. Port facilities, transport corridors, 
and logistical, financial, and accounting services 
are needed. In some cases, oil refining and ore 
processing  can  also  be  carried  out  within  the 
country. All these services are bound to generate 
high-value-added jobs in major cities and hubs. 
But even after including all backward and for-
ward links, the ratio between the total number 
of jobs generated and the number of direct jobs 
is likely to remain in the single digits. Taking into 
account direct and indirect job effects, extractive 
industries may not account for more than 1 or 

2 percent of total employment in resource-rich 
developing countries.

In  addition,  extractive  industries  can  have 
important negative impacts on jobs elsewhere in 
the economy. These effects are often considered 
manifestations of Dutch disease, a reference to 
the  experience  of  the  Netherlands  after  large 
natural  gas  fields  were  discovered  in  the  prov-
ince of Groningen in the late 1950s. The ensuing 
export revenue led to strong real exchange rate 
appreciation,  deterioration  in  competitiveness 
in sectors exposed to international competition, 
and a loss of jobs in these tradable sectors.

Some  industrial  countries  confronted  with 
resource  booms  have  successfully  protected  
or  fostered  the  diversification  of  their  econo-
mies.  Norway  offers  what  may  be  the  most 
striking  example.  With  strong  backing  from 
the  labor  movement,  centralized  collective- 
bargaining agreements ensure that real wages do 
not grow more rapidly than the productivity of 
the  tradable  sectors,  excluding  oil. Wage  mod-
eration supports employment opportunities for 
everybody, to the point that the unemployment 
rate remained close to 3 percent during the re-
cent global financial crisis. Oil revenue is used 
for  long-term  investments  but  is  not  immedi-
ately converted into higher labor earnings.

Among  oil-rich  countries  elsewhere,  the 
United Arab Emirates has also managed to di-
versify its economy through financial and logis-

tics services. But overall, in the Gulf states, na-
tional citizens have become direct beneficiaries 
of the oil bonanza through well-paid jobs in the 
public sector. In the larger countries, these jobs 
are rationed, with some groups, such as women 
and  youth,  having  less  access  than  those  with 
good  connections.  Menial  jobs  are  performed 
by immigrants on temporary contracts who re-
ceive modest pay and benefits. Jobs are a win-
dow to rent sharing for some but do not give a 
stake in society to others.

This  tension  between  jobs  for  productiv-
ity  and  jobs  for  social  cohesion  may  be  even 
more difficult to avoid in developing countries, 
because  they  lack  the  institutional  strength  of 
Norway or the implementation capacity of the 
United Arab Emirates. In resource-rich develop-
ing countries, the concern is not only about los-
ing competitiveness in tradable sectors but also 
about missing out on the benefits of urbaniza-
tion. Indeed, the price of land in major agglom-
erations becomes prohibitively high in resource-
rich developing countries. By one measure, the 
most expensive city in the world is Luanda (ta-
ble 6.2). According to this measure, 3 of the top 
5, and 9 of the top 50 most expensive cities in the 
world are in resource-rich developing countries.
Because they do not have the economic den-
sity  of  London,  New  York,  or  Tokyo,  cities  in 

resource-rich developing countries find it diffi-
cult to reap the benefits of agglomeration. Spe-
cialization  in  the  production  of  commodities 
(including agricultural products such as  cocoa) 
may  be  an  important  reason  why  urbaniza-
tion has failed to deliver growth in countries in 
Sub-Saharan Africa.40 These wealthy consump-
tion  agglomerations  are  nonetheless  attracting 
rural  migrants,  thereby  fueling  local  inequal-
ity, discontent, and crime. None of the cities in 
resource-rich  developing  countries  among  the 
top 50 in the world according to cost of living 
is among the top 50 according to quality of life.
While  extractive  industries  fail  to  create  
many jobs, they do contribute to the local econ-
omy  through  other  channels.  A  recent  survey 
of  employees  of  large-scale  mining  projects  in 
Papua  New  Guinea  shows  that  they  make  re-
mittances  both  in  kind  and  in  cash  to  their 
households. Most remittances in kind were for 
construction  and  building  materials  (41  per-
cent),  followed  by  transport-related  items  (28 
percent).41 Cash contributions were used most 
often for school fees (29 percent) and transpor-
tation-related  items  (12  percent).  Employees 
also reported accommodating relatives visiting 
from  rural  areas.  Some  of  their  guests  helped 
with housework, and some obtained education 
at the host’s expense.42

Artisanal mining can flourish in parallel with 
major investments and raise the living standards 
of local communities. In Papua New Guinea, the 
number of grassroots alluvial miners is two to 
three times greater than the number of people 
working in the formal extractive industries sec-
tor, even if contractors and temporary workers 
are counted among the latter. Some of the large 
extractive projects, such as Ok Tedi Mine, hap-
pen to be in poor areas. Thus, the artisanal min-
ing taking place around them helps spread the 
wealth.

But poverty maps show a significant level of 
spatial dispersion in living standards and a per-
sistence of poverty over the past three decades.43 
The  deepest  and  most  persistent  rural  poverty 
in Papua New Guinea occurs in areas with no 
known mineral resources.

When  large  extractive  projects  close,  arti-
sanal and small-scale mining can also contrib-
ute  to  the  local  economy  by  cushioning  the 
decline in earnings. For example, in Misima in 
Papua  New  Guinea,  local  people  had  become 
used to making a living around the only large 
mine project, Misima Mines Limited. When the 
project closed in 2004, the economy of Misima 
ground  to  a  halt,  and  local  residents  found  it 
hard to make ends meet. Artisanal and small-
scale  mining  provided  an  avenue  for  income 

for  some:  each  hard  rock  miner  could  earn 
the  equivalent  of  US$50,000–$75,000  a  year, 
and  each  alluvial  miner  could  make  around 
US$10,000  a  year.  This  income  became  the 
main  contribution  to  the  local  economy,  to-
gether with remittances sent by those ex-Mis-
ima Mines Limited employees who found work 
in large mines elsewhere.44 

And even in mining areas, social impacts are 
more mixed than the positive effect on living 
standards suggests. The influx of money from 
mining enclaves has enabled men to pay high 
prices for brides and marry multiple wives on 
an  unprecedented  scale,  which  might  have 
contributed  to  a  decline  in  women’s  status. 
Around  Porgera  Mine,  the  abandonment  of 
older  wives  and  the  increasing  number  of 
women taken from other tribal groups are con-
sidered  factors  in  the  increased  incidence  of 
domestic violence and tension with neighbor-
ing groups. In Lihir, when groups of landown-
ers  received  compensation  and  royalty  pay-
ments,  no  women  were  given  authority  to 
control  the  accounts.45  In  addition,  children 
normally help out in artisanal and small-scale 
mines. In Misima, because of clear restrictions 
and  training  by  the  Wau  Small-Scale  Mining 
Center,  children  are  less  involved  in  mining 
than  before,  but  child  labor  remains  a  con-

202 

  WO R L D   D E V E LO P M E N T   R E P O RT   2 0 1 3

cern.46  Finally,  land  disputes  often  take  place 
among artisanal miners as people tend to tres-
pass on other’s land to find minerals.47 

Beyond local communities, the boom in ex-
tractive industries is affecting jobs in the main 
agricultural sector of Papua New Guinea. Palm 
oil exports have been growing steadily in recent 
years and now exceed the exports of all other ag-
ricultural crops combined. Remarkably, the pro-
duction of palm oil fruit involves 18,000 small-
holder  blocks  around  the  main  plantations.48 
While this sector makes a significant contribu-
tion to the economy, improving rural livelihoods 
and  generating  employment,  the  extractive  in-
dustries boom is undermining the competitive-
ness of palm oil exports through higher wages 
for skilled employees and higher logistics costs.

The higher wages paid to skilled workers are 
also eroding the effectiveness of the public sec-
tor.  Entire  departments  in  government  and  in 
education  and  training  institutions  have  been 
depleted because their staff leaves for more at-
tractive opportunities in the extractive industries 
sector.  Mining  companies  complain  about  the 
shortage of skills at the same time as they poach 
people  away  from  the  education  and  training 
system,  where  they  could  help  build  skills.  For 
instance,  among  181  interviewees  in  a  recent 
survey on large-scale mining projects, 58 work-
ers (or 32 percent) had at least a university de-
gree.49 Raising salaries in the public sector may 
be needed, but that would create other problems. 
Absenteeism is rife and service delivery is poor. 
Without strengthened accountability, higher sal-
aries would only transform many public sector 
jobs into a window for rent sharing.

An  encouraging  development  has  been  the 
success  of  some  landowner  companies  around 
mining  enclaves.  These  companies  may  have 
built  up  a  good  work  ethic  and  developed  ef-
fective business practices in places that were far 
removed from the modern economy only a few 
years  ago.  Not  all  landowner  companies  have 
been  successful,  however,  and  this  model  may 
fail to spread the wealth from extractive indus-
tries beyond the surrounding areas (box 6.6).

The challenge of resource-rich economies is 
often framed in terms of transparency, which is 
certainly  important  for  social  cohesion.  How-
ever, accounting for the money involved in ex-
tractive industries is only part of the solution. 
Equally  important  is  ensuring  that  resources 
flow  from  booming  enclaves  and  hubs  to  the 
poorer  parts  of  the  country,  especially  in  the 
form of basic infrastructure and service deliv-
ery. Focusing the flow of resources on the de-
mand side rather than on the supply side (for 
example, on health insurance rather than pub-
lic  hospitals)  may  contribute  to  productivity 
rather than to the creation of new windows for 
rent sharing.

Beyond  public  finance,  the  concentration 
of  wealth  in  mining  enclaves  and  urban  hubs 
requires attention to spatial pricing issues. The 
benefits of agglomeration cannot be reaped if 
urban  land  becomes  prohibitively  expensive. 
Active efforts are needed to increase the avail-
ability of urban land and keep urban housing 
affordable. Despite such efforts, the cost of la-
bor is bound to be much higher in mining en-
claves and urban hubs. Labor policies need to 
take  these  disparities  into  account  and  avoid 
making  workers  too  expensive  in  poorer  and 
more  remote  areas  through  minimum  wages 
or mandated benefits that mimic the wages and 
benefits  available  in  the  booming  parts  of  the 
country.

The  main  challenge  facing  resource-rich 
countries is to spread the wealth in ways that do 
not undermine productivity growth and social 
cohesion spillovers. Good jobs for development 
in this context are those that generate output (as 
opposed to just absorbing it) outside the extrac-
tive industries sector. Incentives for firms to cre-
ate jobs and for people to work are important 
if  the  economy  is  going  to  diversify  its  export 
base.  The  abundance  of  foreign  currency  can 
be a constraint because of exchange rate appre-
ciation. The experience of some countries, most 
notably  Norway,  shows  how  sovereign  funds 
that are used for long-run investments can man-
age this foreign currency problem.

BOX 6.6    Landowner companies can build capacity while spreading the wealth

Firms linked to local landowner groups in Papua New Guinea are 
developing  increasingly  diversified  businesses  and  are  able  to 
compete regionally, even nationally, thereby generating jobs with 
a range of skill levels. The origin of these firms is the communal 
ownership  of  land  in  Papua  New  Guinea,  which  has  meant  that 
mining companies have had to pay compensation for land to com-
munities rather than to individuals. As a result, some of the land-
owner  companies  have  up  to  300,000  shareholders.  National 
agencies  negotiate  with  individual  resources  projects  for  local 
landowning  groups  to  have  privileged  rights  to  supply  selected 
services to the project. 

The  most  successful  landowner  companies,  including  Trans 
Wonderland,  Anitua,  the  iPi  Group,  National  Catering,  and  Star 
Mountain,  are  locally  managed.  Their  business  activities  extend 
beyond the core job streams of the extractive industries sector in 
exploration,  construction,  and  extraction.  For  example,  they  pro-
vide logistical services through a franchise truck-ownership struc-
ture and catering services that reach out to all Papua New Guinea 
including to customers outside the natural resource sectors.

The key to the successes of these companies may be the clear 
separation  between  their  social  roles  and  their  business  model, 
which builds on solid corporate governance. The landowner origins 
and commercial focus allow them to partner with landowner groups 
in other resource project areas, which helps them to build scale and 
management depth. Expatriates with a genuine interest in develop-
ment  seem  to  have  played  an  important  part  in  achieving  the 
proper balance.

Not all landowner companies have been equally successful. Most 
exist purely to distribute rents from mines to communities and have 
no  ambitions  of  building  sustainable  economic  opportunities  for 
their members. Two of four companies established in Central Prov-
ince never gained a foothold because the funds that were supposed 
to serve as equity vanished. Even the successful landowner compa-
nies may be unsustainable beyond the construction phase of extrac-
tive  industries,  during  which  the  demand  for  support  services  is 
exceptionally  high.  Skeptics  wonder  whether  building  work  skills 
through the  development  of  these businesses is  really  more valu-
able than investing in service delivery through local infrastructure.

Small island nations

The  jobs  agendas  of  small  island  nations  are 
shaped by their market size and their geography. 
Because  of  their  size,  these  countries  cannot 
exploit economies of scale or reap the benefits 
of  agglomeration  or  specialization.  As  islands, 
many  of  them  are  characterized  by  fragmen-
tation—an  already-small  population  spread 
thinly  over  large  areas.  For  example,  Fiji  has  a 
population  of  around  860,000  people  and  a  
total  territory  of  18,274  square  miles,  but  this 
land is fragmented across a total 332 islands. Yet 
jobs in cities and clusters rely on scale and den-
sity to create positive spillovers. 

With  limited  domestic  markets,  small  is-
land nations need to look outward to overcome 

problems  of  scale.  Exporting  to  larger  foreign 
markets  is  difficult,  however,  as  the  disadvan-
tage  of  smallness  manifests  itself  in  the  form 
of  higher  production  costs.  Given  that  small 
countries  are  price-takers  in  world  markets, 
these  cost  premiums  are  hard  to  pass  on  to 
customers. The only way these economies can 
export  is  by  accepting  lower  profits  and  labor 
earnings. But in industries such as electronic as-
sembly and clothing, even if capital earns nega-
tive returns and wages are zero, the unit cost of 
production in a tiny economy would still exceed 
prevailing world prices. 50 

A number of small island nations, especially 
those located in the Pacific Ocean, are also con-
fronted with the challenge of remoteness. When 
small islands are located far away from economic 

204 

  WO R L D   D E V E LO P M E N T   R E P O RT   2 0 1 3

centers, the cost of trading with them may be-
come  prohibitive.  In  the  case  of  Pacific  island 
nations,  the  average  GDP-weighted  distance 
to trading partners is about 11,000 kilometers, 
compared with about 8,000 kilometers for small 
countries  in  the  Caribbean  (figure  6.3).51  Not 
surprisingly,  these  Pacific  island  nations  also 
trade less relative to other small countries.

Smallness  and  fragmentation  further  raise 
the costs of public services and infrastructure. A 
road, an energy network, or a government min-
istry that serves 100,000 people is likely to have 
a higher cost per user than one serving 10 mil-
lion people. High fixed costs have to be spread 
across  a  smaller  number  of  people,  and  often 
across a larger number of locations, which im-
plies higher costs of doing business. 

These geographic challenges are fundamen-
tal to the economic experience of these small is-
land nations. Unfortunately, policies cannot al-
ter these disadvantages, but they can be partially 
offset  through  integration  with  bigger  econo-
mies.  Canada’s  seasonal  agricultural  worker 
program  with  Caribbean  and  Latin  American 
countries  is  an  example.  Several  other  similar 
bilateral  agreements  have  been  introduced.52 
In fact, tighter political relationships with large 
economic  centers  are  found  to  be  associated

nations.53 

Migration is one of the key channels for eco-
nomic  integration. As  workers  move  to  larger 
economic  centers,  they  gain  access  to  larger 
markets, cheaper inputs, and more investment. 
Thus, the labor force is put to more productive 
use and can earn higher incomes. In turn, re-
mittances  from  migrants  improve  living  stan-
dards at home. Moving labor to larger markets 
also allows workers and entrepreneurs to inter-
act  with  more  dynamic  firms,  thus  acquiring 
better  and  more  diversified  skills  and  gaining 
exposure to new ideas. 

Emigrants account for over 20 percent of the 
total population in a majority of these countries. 
On average, remittances are responsible for over 
8  percent  of  GDP  in  Pacific  island  countries 
and for 5 percent in other small island nations 
(figure 6.4). In fact, migration is behind several 
success stories. Samoa has a long history of mi-
gration  into  New  Zealand,  through  a  treaty  of 
friendship in existence for more than 30 years, 
and  the  Cook  Islands  are  in  a  free  association 
with New Zealand. Both have been able to reg-
ister sustained growth in contrast to the experi-
ences of other Pacific island nations.54

It may take time for the benefits from migra-
tion  to  materialize,  as  a  comparison  of  Tonga 
and Fiji illustrates. Tonga has more than 40 years 
of substantial migration and receives large per 
capita  remittance  flows.  In  Fiji,  international 
migration is a much more recent phenomenon. 
Household  surveys  show  that  more  than  90 
percent  of  households  receive  remittances  in 
Tonga, compared with 43 percent of households 
in Fiji.55

The  different  historical  paths  influence  the 
impact of migration on the domestic economy. 
In  countries  with  a  more  mature  migration, 
household behavior at home is more tilted to-
ward  business  activities.  In  both  Tonga  and 
Fiji,  migration  and  remittances  lead  to  higher 
savings,  but  they  have  a  different  impact  on 
household  income  generation.  In  Tonga,  both 
the number of emigrants and the level of remit-
tances  received  are  associated  with  increasing 
income from business activities. In Fiji, by con-
trast, remittances do not seem to affect business 
income  and  have  a  negative  relationship  with 
wage earnings—as if migration just served as a 
substitute for wage employment in the domestic 
economy. 56

Note: GDP = gross domestic product. Nineteen small island nations are included in panel a on migration and 15 small island nations in panel b on remittances. The variation of 
remittances in Pacific Island countries over time is driven by missing data from Samoa.

Migration does not always lead to a win-win 
situation,  however.  For  example,  large  remit-
tance  flows  raise  the  prospect  of  Dutch  dis-
ease—the appreciation of the real exchange rate 
due to the abundance of foreign currency. Brain 
drain is also a salient feature in these countries, 
at  least  in  the  short  term.  Their  migrants  are 
more educated than their general population. In 
12 of 19 small island nations, more than 30 per-
cent of total emigrants are skilled workers; in 14 
of them, skilled emigrants represent more than 
40 percent of the domestic skilled population.57 
While  these  migrants  experience  large  income 
gains, send substantial remittances back, and do 
transfer knowledge, they do not appear to trade 
with their home countries or invest in them to 
any large degree.58 In Caribbean countries, the 
outmigration  of  health  personnel  has  raised 
particular concerns because of its negative im-
pact on health systems.

On  the  other  hand,  migration  and  remit-
tances  can  promote  human  capital  accumula-
tion.  The  possibility  to  migrate  may  motivate 
greater  investments  in  education,  and  remit-
tances may finance them. Short-term migration 
can offer workers better training and education 
opportunities,  which  adds  to  domestic  human 

capital  stock  once  the  migrants  return.59  Evi-
dence from Fiji suggests that migration oppor-
tunities increase the probability that household 
members  will  acquire  tertiary  education.60  Re-
sults from qualitative surveys in Fiji also indicate 
that  workers  are  prompted  to  acquire  special 
skills for migration.61 

Viable jobs in small islands are traditionally 
associated  with  the  exploitation  of  natural  re-
sources including fisheries, forestry, mining, and 
tourism.  When  niche  opportunities  exist,  low 
business  costs  become  less  critical  for  attract-
ing  investment.  In  Fiji,  sugar  production  and 
tourism are the largest sources of employment. 
As the most important agribusiness, sugar pro-
duction contributes about 8 percent of exports 
and  employs  over  10  percent  of  total  popula-
tion.  Annually,  half  a  million  visitors  come  to 
Fiji, while the local population is less than one 
million. Tourism has become a main source of 
employment growth in the formal sector.62 

The  reliance  on  natural  resources,  however, 
raises the vulnerability of these countries. These 
sectors  tend  to  be  more  susceptible  to  natu-
ral  shocks—both  natural  disasters  and  volatile 
rainfall patterns. As with geographical disadvan-
tages, policies cannot eradicate the vulnerability. 

206 

  WO R L D   D E V E LO P M E N T   R E P O RT   2 0 1 3

But jobs exploiting natural resources should not 
undermine the fragile ecosystem of the islands. 
When conducted in a sustainable manner, tour-
ism  and  fisheries  have  positive  environmental 
impacts.

Ensuring  a  broad  distribution  of  the  rents 
from  jobs  in  the  natural  resource  sectors  is 
challenging.  For  example,  Vanuatu’s  impres-
sive growth has not had an impact on the lives 
of  most  residents.  The  country’s  development 
has been driven by foreign investment in tour-
ism,  financial  services,  and  land  development, 
and  only  a  relatively  small  proportion  of  the 
urban population is reaping the gains. This has 
increased inequality and may lead to disruptive 
social trends.63 

A  closer  look  at  the  Mauritius  miracle 
shows how small island nations might be able 
to diversify into activities not based on the ex-
ploitation  of  natural  resources.  Between  1977 
and 2009, real GDP grew at 5.1 percent a year 
in  Mauritius,  compared  with  3.2  percent  for 
Sub-Saharan  Africa  overall.  The  World  Eco-
nomic Forum ranks Mauritius as the second-
most-competitive  country  in  the  region.  This 
sustained  growth  has  been  accompanied  by  a 
profound structural transformation over time. 
Poor  at  independence  in  1968,  Mauritius  has 
transitioned from a sugar economy to manu-
facturing  textiles  and  apparel  to  knowledge-

intensive services in tourism, finance, and in-
formation communication technologies.64 

Many explanations have been offered for the 
Mauritius  miracle.  There  is  no  doubt  that  the 
focus  on  trade  and  foreign  direct  investment, 
and on using export processing zones to target 
light manufacturing industries, has been a criti-
cal element of Mauritius’ success. The country 
also boasts low corruption levels and a favorable 
regulatory  environment,  coupled  with  strong 
public-private  sector  cooperation  and  flexible 
institutions.65  But  the  circumstances  that  al-
lowed  Mauritius  to  embark  on  this  remark-
able  development  path  were  exceptional.  They 
included the quota system that used to govern 
garment  exports.  Other  small  island  nations 
may not enjoy such opportunities these days.

Small  island  nations  face  unique  difficul-
ties because they cannot benefit from the gains 
of  scale  or  specialization.  These  difficulties  are 
intensified  in  places  such  as  the  Pacific  island 
countries, which are far from major centers of 
economic activity. The experience of Mauritius 
shows what might be possible with strategic pol-
icies, strong institution building, and a dose of 
luck. But for many small island states, establish-
ing links with nearby economic centers, maxi-
mizing the benefits of migration, and exploiting 
niche markets while preserving their fragile eco-
system point the way forward.

Countries with high youth 
unemployment

Young  people  are  much  more  likely  to  be  un-
employed than older adults. In most countries, 
unemployment rates for youth, defined as 15–
24 years old, are usually between two and three 
times  the  overall  unemployment  rate  (figure 
6.5). And the unemployment rate captures only 
one aspect of the problems young people face in 

their transition from school to work. In agrarian 
countries, for example, open unemployment is 
low and youth employment difficulties are likely 
to manifest themselves in poor job quality and 
low earnings. In countries with high youth un-
employment, job quality may be a problem for 
those  young  people  who  do  find  work.  In  the 
Arab Republic of Egypt, informality is two times 
more common among 15- to 24-year-old work-
ers  than  among  35-  to  54-year-olds.66  Highly

segmented  labor  markets  offer  limited  scope 
to make the transition from informal to formal 
jobs. In Tunisia, even in those sectors that largely 
employ youth labor, employment is often tem-
porary and informal.67 

The  stakes  in  youth  unemployment  are 
high.  Recent  events  in  the Arab  world  and  in 
southern Europe have highlighted the discon-
tent of educated youth whose employment op-
portunities  are  falling  short  of  expectations. 
The Arab Spring may boost transparency and 
accountability in the region, but if jobs do not 
follow,  greater  instability  may  result.68  Youth 
employment  problems  have  economic  costs, 
not only in the short run but also in the lon-
ger term. Unemployment among young people 
can  lead  to  permanent  scarring  effects  in  the 
form  of  lower  future  earnings.69  The  lack  of 
job opportunities may also lead to discourage-
ment. Some of the decline in youth unemploy-
ment in the aftermath of the global crisis is ac-
tually driven by young people dropping out of 
the labor force.70

Many  countries  with  youth  unemployment 
problems  have  very  large  youth  cohorts.  In 
Zimbabwe,  where  43  percent  of  the  working-
age population is between 15 and 24, the youth 
unemployment  rate  is  three  times  higher  than 
the  overall  unemployment  rate.  The  Middle 
East and North Africa, which has especially high 
youth  unemployment,  is  an  overwhelmingly 
young region. More than 100 million people are 
between  the  ages  of  15  and  29,  making  up  30 
percent of the region’s population and about 47 
percent  of  the  working-age  population.  Youth 
cohorts  this  large  are  not  only  likely  to  face 
higher unemployment rates but also tend to ex-
ert downward pressure on labor earnings.71

But demography is far from the whole story. 
Not  all  countries  with  pressing  youth  employ-
ment  problems  have  “youth  bulges.”  In  Sri 
Lanka, less than one-quarter of the working age 
population is between 15 and 24, but the youth 
unemployment rate is more than three times the 
overall rate. And even where youth cohorts are 
large,  young  people  may  encounter  other  bar-
riers to employment. Poor information on job 
seekers  and  on  employment  opportunities  is 
one  reason  why  young  people  face  more  diffi-
culties than adults in finding jobs. Where private 
and public agencies and other sources of labor 
market  information  are  not  well  developed, 
personal  networks  are  important  for  match-

ing  people  and  jobs. A  majority  of  workers  in 
most Middle Eastern and North African coun-
tries have found their jobs through family and 
friends.72  Adults  tend  to  have  better  networks 
than  young  people  going  through  the  transi-
tion from education to employment. If a large 
percentage of a person’s network is unemployed, 
the chances of that person finding a job are low.
A  skills  mismatch  is  the  other  common 
explanation.  Close  to  40  percent  of  the  firms 
 surveyed  through  investment  climate  assess-
ments  in  the  Middle  East  and  North  Africa 
report  that  the  limited  availability  of  skilled 
labor  is  a  major  constraint  on  business.  Lack 
of formal schooling, which has increased sub-
stantially in the region, is not the cause. In fact, 
youth  unemployment  rates  tend  to  rise  with 
educational  attainment  in  many  countries.  In 
Morocco, young people with a university edu-
cation  had  an  unemployment  rate  in  2009  of 
17  percent,  3.7  times  the  rate  for  those  with 
primary  education  or  less.  In  Tunisia,  23  per-
cent of university-educated youth were unem-
ployed in 2010, compared with 11 percent for 
nongraduates.73 In Tunisia, it takes graduates 28 
months on average to find a job, compared with 
19 months for nongraduates.74 Not only has un-

employment been increasing, but the employ-
ment  deficit  is  expected  to  grow  more  among 
university  graduates  than  among  people  with 
less education (figure 6.6). 

The paradox of high unemployment among 
the  highly  educated  is  related  to  the  growth  
path of countries in the Middle East and North 
Africa, where the civil service and state-owned 
enterprises  have  long  been  the  employers  of 
choice  and  education  systems  were  built  to 
feed  them  with  staff.  Students  aspire  to  public 
sector  jobs,  where  benefits  are  generous  and 
employment  is  stable,  and  focus  on  obtaining 
academic credentials rather than skills that en-
hance  employability.75  There  is  a  striking  dif-
ference between the preferred educational path 
of youth in the region and that of youth in the 
high-performing East Asian countries. In 2009, 
one-quarter or less of the university students in 
Algeria, Lebanon, and Saudi Arabia were major-
ing in science, technology, or engineering.76 In 
some  East  Asian  countries,  such  as  China,  the 
Republic of Korea, and Malaysia, that share was 
more than two-fifths.77 

Prescriptions  on  how  to  address  the  jobs 
challenge  in  countries  with  high  youth  unem-

ployment  usually  build  on  these  two  explana-
tions.  The  poor  flow  of  information  between 
employers and jobseekers is seen as a justifica-
tion for active labor market policies that focus 
on improving the match between labor supply 
and  demand.  Counseling  can  help  jobseekers 
understand what they have to offer and where 
the opportunities are. Temporary employment 
programs may provide a first job and make em-
ployers realize the value of a young worker. As 
for skills, the contrast between high educational 
attainment  and  high  unemployment  rates  is 
seen  as  an  indication  of  a  disconnect  between 
the quality and relevance of schooling and the 
actual  needs  of  the  labor  market.  Improving 
youth employment prospects, it is argued, will 
critically  depend  on  restructuring  education 
and  training  systems  to  produce  marketable 
skills rather than credentials.78 In the short term, 
training programs are indeed the most obvious 
response to provide unemployed youth with the 
practical skills employers need.

The  potential  impact  of  these  prescriptions 
is  limited,  however.  Better  information,  coun-
seling,  and  temporary  employment  programs 
can certainly help some jobseekers, but whether

they would make a major dent in the aggregate 
unemployment  rate  is  unclear.  Better  matches 
between  jobseekers  and  employment  oppor-
tunities would result in large increases in total 
employment  only  if  there  were  many  unfilled 
vacancies. But that is not the case in the Middle 
East and North Africa. Part of the high unem-
ployment  rate  among  graduates  stems  from 
the  fact  that  the  demand  for  skilled  labor  de-
rives mainly from public administration, where 
growth is constrained by budgetary issues, and 
by  increasing  privatization  and  deregulation.79 
Meanwhile,  the  main  sources  of  private  sector 
growth  (such  as  construction  and  low-value-
added services) demand unskilled workers, for 
the most part.80

The  problem  is  similar  with  training  pro-
grams.  Educated  youth  have  the  capacity  to 
learn quickly. If employers wanted it, they could 
even provide on-the-job training as needed. But 
training may not change aspirations.

Despite its diminishing absorption capacity, 
the public sector in the Middle East and North 
Africa  region  remains  the  main  client  of  the 
higher  education  system  and  thus  shapes  stu-
dent expectations and choices. The public sector 
still accounts for about one-third of overall em-
ployment in countries such as the Arab Republic 
of Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, and the Republic of Ye-
men.81 In some of these countries, public sector 
employment  has  recorded  modest  growth  in 
recent years, but budgetary pressures will inevi-
tably result in a severe contraction in the future. 
Aspirations remain, however, and, for many of 
the unemployed youth who have pursued uni-
versity  education  in  the  expectation  of  getting 
a public sector job, there is a sense of a broken 
promise.

Information,  counseling,  and  training  are 
unlikely to overcome this frustration. Addressing 
the jobs challenge of countries with high youth 
unemployment rates requires a dynamic private 
sector  that  can  create  employment  opportuni-
ties commensurate with the education and aspi-
rations of new entrants to the labor market.

Growth alone may not be enough. After all, 
few countries have had a better economic per-
formance than Tunisia, the first country in the 
Arab  world  in  which  jobs  discontent  erupted 
into political turmoil. Between 2000 and 2010, 
its GDP expanded at an average annual rate of 
almost 5 percent; meanwhile, the overall unem-

ployment rate remained at 14 percent or above, 
and  the  rate  for  university  graduates  exceeded 
30 percent. 

The key questions are why growth in Tunisia 
and other countries with high youth unemploy-
ment  has  not  been  more  labor  intensive  and 
why  the  sectors  that  have  expanded  the  most 
rely on unskilled workers. The answers may be 
in  the  product  market  more  than  in  the  labor 
market. Although many countries in the region 
have  implemented  reforms  to  reduce  red  tape 
and  improve  the  overall  business  climate,  dis-
cretion,  arbitrariness,  and  unequal  treatment 
still hinder competition and private sector de-
velopment, especially in skills-intensive sectors 
such as telecommunications. In many countries 
in  the  Middle  East  and  North  Africa,  connec-
tions  with  political  power  may  matter  more 
for success than entrepreneurial capacity.82 The 
perks often extend to the workers in these cos-
seted businesses, under the form of job security 
and other benefits, adding to the frustration of 
those left out.

Firm  dynamics  provide  some  evidence  of 
the difficulties associated with job creation and 
employment  growth  in  these  countries.  Rates 
of new firm registration are low in most coun-
tries in the region.83 And even when they do get 
started, small firms face barriers in growing into 
sizable  companies.  The  vast  majority  of  Tuni-
sian formal firms are small: 86 percent of them 
are  one-person  entities,  and  only  0.4  percent 
have 100 workers or more. But these large firms 
account  for  more  than  one-third  of  all  jobs, 
more than all the one-person firms combined. 
A study of their dynamics over a decade shows 
that micro- and small firms hardly ever become 
large  firms.  Moreover,  one-person  firms  only 
very rarely graduate into the small size category, 
and many are likely to shut down.84

While countries with high youth unemploy-
ment may face a large youth bulge or education 
quality  issues,  problems  are  often  on  the  de-
mand  side,  with  limited  competition  reducing 
employment opportunities, especially for highly 
skilled youth. Many countries in the Middle East 
and  North Africa  would  have  greater  scope  to 
generate more jobs for young people if the bar-
riers to firm entry and growth were eased. This 
prospect  is  unlikely  to  materialize,  however,  as 
long as political connections remain more im-
portant  than  entrepreneurial  capacity  to  enter 

210

into the modern sector. Ending privilege, more 
than improving labor market matching or up-
grading skills, is thus the priority for countries 
with high youth unemployment. Dynamism in 
more skills-intensive sectors would lead to faster 
growth  by  putting  educated  youth  to  work.  It 

would  result  in  higher  living  standards  by  re-
ducing  the  burden  protected  activities  put  on 
others.  And  it  would  reinforce  a  sense  of  fair-
ness in society—a sense that young people can 
get ahead by what they know rather than who 
they know.

Formalizing economies

The  challenge  of  formalization  is  present  in 
economies where a large share of the labor force 
is already covered by labor legislation and social 
protection  programs,  and  reaching  universal 
coverage seems attainable. But going in that di-
rection  raises  serious  tradeoffs.  Formalization 
is  often  seen  as  necessary  to  strengthen  social 
cohesion. It is also bound to increase the living 
standards of those who get under the purview 
of labor law and gain access to social protection. 
But formalization may reduce productivity if it 
distorts incentives or puts a burden on firms.

Formalizing  economies  are  characterized 
by already large or growing urban populations 
where many residents have incomes well above 
poverty  levels,  yet  where  many  still  work  in 
informal  employment.  The  emerging  middle 
classes  in  these  economies  demand  advanced 
public  services,  including  tertiary  education, 
health care, and pensions. They are often frus-
trated by poor governance. They may perceive 
taxes  and  public  sector  benefits  as  useless  or 
unfair  and  resent  the  weak  physical  and  in-
stitutional infrastructure, as well as the exces-
sive  regulatory  load.  These  frustrations  beget 
avoidance  and  evasion  of  regulations,  and,  in 
such a climate, informal jobs not only persist 
but can even proliferate.85

This state of affairs, sometimes described as 
an informality trap, reflects a weak social con-
tract.86 That a large share of a country’s urban 
labor force is informal is sometimes interpreted 

as a sign that the state is unable to enforce regu-
lations and citizens are unwilling to comply with 
them.87

The  prevalence  of  informal  employment  in 
these  relatively  advanced  economies  can  nur-
ture  poverty  and  social  exclusion.88 Almost  by 
definition, informal workers lack legal job pro-
tections and social insurance coverage, making 
them  more  vulnerable  to  workplace  abuses, 
health  risks,  and  the  vagaries  of  the  business 
cycle. Informal workers face a higher probabil-
ity of poverty and often perceive themselves as 
poor.89  Men  represent  a  majority  of  informal 
workers,  but  the  probability  for  them  to  work 
in  the  informal  sector  is  generally  lower  than 
for women, making informality another source 
of gender inequality. In Peru, informality rates 
are 76 and 66 percent for women and men, re-
spectively.  In  South  Africa,  the  corresponding 
rates are 37 and 30 percent. The Arab Republic 
of Egypt is a notable exception, with rates of 23 
and 54 percent, respectively.90

Informality is also associated with low pro-
ductivity.  Most  informal  workers  are  either 
 self-employed  or  work  for  small  unregistered 
firms, with low capital per worker, limited tech-
nology, and no scale economies. In Turkey, the 
differential in total factor productivity between 
formal and informal firms is 19 percent in man-
ufacturing and 62 percent in services.91 A study 
in six Latin American countries finds that labor 
productivity is 30 percent higher in formal firms 
than in informal firms.92 The use of public ser-
vices by the informal sector, without proper tax

contributions,  puts  a  burden  on  formal  firms 
and lowers their productivity as well.93

It  does  not  follow  that  formalization  alone 
would increase productivity. Evidence shows that 
firms do not become more profitable simply by 
formalizing.94 Low productivity may reflect self- 
selection  by  workers  and  firms,  who  choose 
whether to formalize depending on the balance 
between  the  associated  benefits  and  costs.  For 
many workers, the poor quality of social protec-
tion and the possibility of relying on others in 
case of adverse shocks may make informal sector 
employment a preferred alternative. An analysis 
of labor market dynamics in Brazil and Mexico 
confirms that a substantial part of the informal 
sector workforce, particularly the self-employed, 
appears to voluntarily exit from the formal sec-
tor.95  Self-selection  also  occurs  in  the  case  of 
firms. A business tax reduction and simplifica-
tion adopted in Brazil in 1996 led to a significant 
increase in formality among microenterprises.96 
In  other  cases,  workers  with  limited  access  to 
asset  accumulation  find  themselves  trapped  in 
low-productivity informal jobs or use this sec-
tor as a last resort to escape unemployment. In 
Colombia  and  Argentina,  evidence  shows  that 
a  large  share  of  workers,  particularly  low-skill 
workers, are systematically less likely to work in 
the formal sector despite being willing to work in 
it.97 In any case, informality is clearly a multilay-
ered  phenomenon  with  some  workers  trapped 
in this sector and others self-selecting into it.98

Personal  views  about  informality  are  actu-
ally  very  diverse.99  For  example,  some  partici-
pants in a focus group of young women from a  
better-off  neighborhood  in  Durban,  South  
Africa, associated good jobs with formal occu-
pations such as doctor, lawyer, teacher, nurse, or 
police woman: “Being a police-woman is a good 
way  to  make  a  living  because  they  get  benefits 
and  they  help  protect  the  community.”  Other 
participants, from a poorer neighborhood, iden-
tified  good  jobs  as  those  in  farming  (“because 
you  can  sell  the  veggies”)  or  sewing  (“because 
you can make a lot of money”). But other infor-
mal sector jobs were seen as bad because they in-
volved financial precariousness and hard work-
ing conditions. Among them were working as a 
domestic worker (“because you have to go door 
to door asking people if they have a job for you. 
. . . [They] would pay you R30 and say because 
you are just helping”) or cutting grass (“because

In the long run, the informal sector tends to 
be larger in countries where labor productivity 
is  lower,  government  services  are  weaker,  and 
the  business  environment  is  less  flexible.100  A 
controversial question is how much labor mar-
ket and business regulations actually contribute 
to  informality.101  Responses  by  firms  surveyed 
in  investment  climate  assessments  suggest  that 
labor  legislation  is  not  necessarily  the  main 
cause  of  informality,  not  because  the  laws  and 
regulations  are  irrelevant,  but  because  they  are 
regarded with irreverence. Corruption and taxa-
tions are seen as the most vexing obstacles firms 
face  (figure  6.7).  Recent  research  also  indicates

BOX 6.7    The debate on how to reduce informality is intense in Mexico

Having  at  least  one  member  working  in  the  formal  sector  allows 
Mexican families to have a regular source of income, health cover-
age for all, and, through these, access to the support of social net-
works.  A  case  study,  based  on  both  ethnographic  and  statistical 
evidence, makes the case that households whose members fail to 
secure formal jobs are more likely to fall into poverty because of the 
risk  of  catastrophic  health  expenses.  They  are  also  less  likely  to 
secure social support from relatives and neighbors.a Formal employ-
ment is thus critical for living standards in Mexico.

Despite  a  GDP  per  capita  around  US$14,000  in  purchasing 
power  parity  terms,  Mexico’s  informal  employment  has  ranged 
from 50 to 62 percent of total employment depending on the defi-
nition used. This rate is considered high given the country’s devel-
opment  level  and  has  not  shown  consistent  signs  of  decline  in 
nearly two decades. Several studies argue that restrictive labor leg-
islation is a factor explaining Mexico’s large informal economy.b The 
country has tried unsuccessfully to reform its main labor law, which 
was  enacted  in  1973  and  which  is  tied  to  rights  enshrined  in  the 
1917 constitution. 

Weak enforcement is another factor behind informality in Mex-
ico.  The  government  announced  a  doubling  of  inspectors  at  the 
Ministry of Labor in 2012, from 300 to 600. This number still com-
pares unfavorably with other countries.c Labor courts are also over-
stretched: cases may take between three and six years to reach a 
conclusion.d

This  stagnation  in  the  reform  of  legislation  and  enforcement 
contrasts with the expansion of a successful cash transfer program, 
Oportunidades,  and  a  noncontributory  social  insurance  program, 

Seguro Popular. Oportunidades covers nearly one-fifth of the total 
population and nearly all the rural poor, making it one of the best-
targeted poverty reduction programs in the country. Seguro Popu-
lar  is  the  most  rapidly  growing  program,  claiming  a  coverage  of 
more than 50 million by April 2012.e But some preliminary research 
finds that non-contributory programs in general, and Seguro Popu-
lar, in particular, may induce informality or, at least, discourage for-
mal employment.f

Meanwhile,  the  debate  about  the  universalization  of  health 
insurance is very much alive in Mexico. Academics and policy mak-
ers argue over it, and it is also a topic of political controversy. Much 
 pivots on how much universalization will cost. Estimates vary widely 
from no incremental costs because of efficiency and tax collection 
gains to relatively large costs when accounting for long-term demo-
graphic changes. These differences originate from different meth-
odologies, which indicate the complexity of the topic and the diffi-
culty in gauging the full implications of the reform.g 

Mexico’s debate on formalization needs to be cast in a broader 
context. In recent years, poverty and unemployment have increased 
while real wages have been stagnant. But other measures of well-
being, such as access to education, health, and social security, have 
continued to improve.h Average productivity has been growing, but 
slowly, which can be due to an excessive churning of jobs and firms.i 
Demographic trends still show high fertility rates for a large share of 
the population, which leads to a social reproduction of poverty and 
informality.j Whether sweeping changes in labor and tax legislation 
as well as in the organization of social protection would substan-
tially reduce informality is still an open question.

that it is business regulations, more than labor 
regulations, that help explain changes in infor-
mality and unemployment.102

Addressing  the  jobs  challenge  faced  by  for-
malizing  economies  requires  extending  social 
protection and the purview of labor laws with-
out choking off economic dynamism. Previous 
attempts  by  Latin  American  countries  to  for-
malize through heavy-handed regulation, man-
dated benefits, and ill-designed social insurance 
programs led to populist enthusiasm but also to 
lower productivity and eventually to economic 
stagnation and poor quality of social protection.

Efforts to reduce informality have taken a new 
twist in recent years. In several Latin American 
countries, sweeping changes in the organization 
of  social  protection  are  being  implemented  or 
proposed.  First,  transfer  programs  have  esca - 
lated. Brazil and Mexico introduced cash trans-
fer  programs  in  the  late  1990s  that  now  cover 
nearly  one-fifth  of  their  populations.103  Brazil, 
Chile,  and  Mexico  have  also  introduced  non-
contributory programs for senior citizens, and 
other  countries  are  following  suit.  More  radi-
cally,  policy  makers  are  debating  whether  to 
make the coverage of social insurance universal,

moving  away  from  the  current  contributory 
systems  toward  the  funding  of  benefits  from 
general tax revenue.104 This reform would cer-
tainly expand the number of beneficiaries, but 
whether it would encourage firms to formalize 
is a matter of intense debate, especially in Mex-
ico (box 6.7).105

So far, few countries have managed to sub-
stantially reduce informality. Rapid growth and 
strengthening  institutions  in  Brazil  and  Chile 
have  made  them  recent  exceptions.  In  both 
cases, changes in labor market regulation have 
had limited effect. Patient accumulation of hu-
man capital and sustained growth have paid off. 
But strengthened rule of law, effective policies, 
and a better perception of the role of the state 
have also helped.

Those who see informality as the outcome of 
a weak social compact argue that the way for-
ward  involves  a  combination  of  enhanced  en-
forcement  of  regulations,  improved  quality  of 
public services, and greater policy coherence.106 
If  informality  is  associated  with  production 
units  that  evade,  elude,  or  stay  outside  regu-

lation,  a  three-pronged  strategy  may  be  war-
ranted.107  For  those  who  clearly  work  outside 
the purview of regulations, the reach of human 
development and social protection services and 
activation  policies  should  be  expanded.  For 
those  who  work  in  stunted  firms  that  legally 
avoid  becoming  formal,  regulations  should  be 
simplified  and  their  burden  eased.  Finally,  for 
those in firms that evade regulations, enforce-
ment  should  be  strengthened.  For  this  three-
pronged  strategy  to  have  a  chance  of  success, 
workers  and  employers  need  to  perceive  the 
state  as  a  reliable  and  fair  partner.  If  the  state 
is not able to generate a sense of trust through 
the provision of efficient and good-quality ser-
vices,  neither  regulatory  reform  nor  increased 
enforcement will succeed in increasing formal-
ization substantially. 

The  key  is  to  build  formal  institutions  and 
programs  that  are  not  too  costly  and  that  are 
valued by workers. The jobs agenda of formal-
izing  economies  is  closely  linked,  then,  to  the 
development  of  effective  regulation  and  social 
protection systems.

Aging societies

Declining fertility rates and, in many countries, 
rising life expectancy have led to rapidly aging 
populations in several regions of the world. To-
day’s aging societies are concentrated in indus-
trial  countries,  in  Eastern  Europe,  and  in  the 
Southern Cone of Latin America. China entered 
the aging phase in 2010; and India, the Islamic 
Republic of Iran, Singapore, and Thailand will 
experience  significant  aging  in  the  relatively 
near future.108 

The old-age dependency ratio measures the 
number of people 65 years or older in relation 
to  the  number  of  people  in  the  working-age 
population (15 to 64 years). When this ratio is 
high, the working-age population faces pressure 

to generate income to meet the needs of the el-
derly generation. The old-age dependency ratio 
in  the  Islamic  Republic  of  Iran  and  in  Singa-
pore will rise almost fivefold between now and 
2050. These two countries will have four and six 
 elderly people, respectively, for every ten 15- to 
64-year-olds. China’s old-age dependency ratio 
will rise by a factor of almost four. Many already 
aging  societies  in  Eastern  Europe  as  well  as  in 
Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay, will experience 
a rise in the ratio—a doubling or even more in 
most cases—between now and 2050. 

The reasons for these surges in dependency 
ratios vary across countries. In most, the elderly 
live  longer;  in  some,  there  are  fewer  people  of 
working age. Low fertility rates in Bulgaria con-
tributed  to  a  population  decline  of  15  percent

Note: The simulation assesses the decrease in the total labor force based on the assumption that age-specific labor force participation rates remain constant between 2011 and 
2050.

between  1990  and  2010—and  by  2050,  the 
country is projected to have lost almost 40 per-
cent of its population compared with its peak in 
the mid-1980s. Other Eastern European coun-
tries, such as Bosnia and Herzegovina, Moldova, 
Romania,  and  Ukraine,  are  expected  to  follow 
the same pattern; China’s population will be 50 
million less in 2050 than it is now. In India and 
Singapore and in the Southern Cone countries 
of Latin America, population growth is slowing 
down and will start to decline by the middle of 
the century.

If the labor force participation rates of older 
workers  are  significant  today  and  if  these  lev-
els can be maintained, the impact of aging on 
average income can be cushioned considerably. 
But that may not be enough. If age-specific par-
ticipation  rates  remain  constant,  some  coun-
tries, such as Thailand, would be able to limit 
the absolute decline in its labor force, but many 
others would not. The impact in many Eastern 
European countries, Cuba, and China would be 
stark  because  of  the  decline  in  the  size  of  the 
working  age  population.  Between  2011  and 
2050, Bulgaria would face a 40 percent drop in 

its workforce, Poland 28 percent, and China 17 
percent (figure 6.8).109

Aging  affects  jobs  through  several  chan-
nels.110 Lower fertility may imply higher num-
bers of women ready to seek and take up jobs,  
although little evidence of this has been  observed 
in Eastern Europe over the past 20 years. Smaller 
cohorts of young people could reduce innova-
tive  capacity.  Disability  rates  increase  in  older 
age  groups  and  thus  further  affect  the  labor 
supply  in  aging  populations.111  Understanding 
how  aggregate  savings  will  be  affected  is  also 
important, given that savings drive investment, 
growth, and job creation. Savings typically de-
cline  among  older  age  groups.  This  decline 
could be offset if young people were to build up 
additional  buffers  to  support  their  longer  life 
spans,  especially  if  public  retirement  schemes 
prove unsustainable or are absent. Expenditure 
patterns also vary with age. The rapid rise in the 
long-term care industry in high-income coun-
tries is an example. In the United States, the in-
dustry now counts more than 3 million formal 
jobs,  and  an  estimated  10  million  Americans 
50  years  or  older  (roughly  one-quarter  of  this 

 

Diverse jobs agendas

age group) provide care to one or both of their 
parents.112

Raising  productivity  is  ultimately  essential 
for maintaining living standards in aging soci-
eties where fewer people are working. In many 
Eastern  European  countries,  the  productivity 
gains required would be substantial (figure 6.9). 
If  they  do  not  materialize,  falling  living  stan-
dards will threaten those population groups that 
are vulnerable to poverty.113

Through  jobs,  aging  also  impacts  intergen-
erational  relations  and  social  cohesion.  Migra-
tion and aging have put stress on the traditional 
family-based  support  systems  for  China’s  ru-
ral  elderly,  raising  the  possibility  that  they  will 
have to continue working at later ages and will 
not have assistance, financial or otherwise, from 
their  children.114  The  older  generation  can  feel 
not only neglected, but also excluded. In Poland, 
a 55-year old man felt that “age is a great barrier. 
I’ve submitted my CV and they tell me I am too 
old, they tell me if you were 35 years old we could 
hire you. I have 20 years of experience and they 
expect me to be 35 years old?”115 

Social  security  and  health  systems  in  many 
aging  middle-  and  higher-income  countries 
are  barely  sustainable  as  currently  designed. 
Systems  inspired  by  the  Bismarckian  model, 
where social welfare and insurance are financed 
through  labor  taxes  on  a  pay-as-you-go  basis, 
are particularly vulnerable. A decline in the con-
tribution  base  shrinks  the  resources  available 
for  pensions  and  health  care  at  the  same  time 
that  an  increasing  elderly  population  makes 
more  claims  on  both  systems.  The  health  care 
cost  for  people  age  70  years  and  above,  with 
higher disability prevalence rates, is two to three 
times higher than the cost for people of prime 
working  age.116  While  education  expenditures 
may fall in many aging countries in the medium 
term,  that  in  itself  will  bring  about  further—
and often painful—adjustments as schools close 
and teachers lose their jobs.

The  magnitude  of  adjustments  needed  in 
social  welfare  systems  is  daunting.  In  a  repre-
sentative Eastern European country, the public 
pension system alone could reach a deficit of al-
most 7 percent of GDP in 2050 compared with 
2 percent today.117 To balance the accounts, the 
retirement  age  would  need  to  increase  or  the 
ratio  of  pension  benefits  to  earnings  at  retire-
ment would have to be cut, or some combina-
tion of the two. Such changes could cause mate-

rial hardship for elderly people. The adjustment 
process itself is likely to be painful economically, 
socially,  and  politically.  The  experience  of  sev-
eral  high-income  countries  shows  that  imple-
menting the necessary reforms can stretch social 
cohesion to the limit.

Aging  also  can  make  a  society  less  mobile, 
which  can  have  economic  consequences.  In 
Ukraine,  for  example,  aging  is  taking  place 
against  a  relatively  high  pre-crisis  level  of 
growth  with  very  little  creation  of  jobs.  Some 
firms, though, are desperately looking for work-
ers, both highly skilled and manual. The elderly 
are usually less mobile than the young, and the 
housing market makes changing residence dif-
ficult.  Low  internal  mobility  represents  a  sig-
nificant  bottleneck  to  increasing  activity  and 
raising productivity (box 6.8).

In aging societies like Ukraine, good jobs for 
development are those that keep labor force par-
ticipation  rates  high,  especially  for  the  elderly. 
These  jobs  can  contain  the  decline  in  average 
income while at the same time protecting the vi-
ability of the social insurance system, which, in 
many countries, is under significant fiscal stress. 
Through  these  two  channels,  such  jobs  would 
also  contribute  to  supporting  social  cohesion.

BOX 6.8    In Ukraine, the impact of aging is compounded by migration and declining fertility

Ukraine’s population is shrinking. This country, which stretches from 
the heavily industrialized Russian-speaking east to the more agricul-
tural and predominantly Ukrainian-speaking west, was home to 52 
million people when the Soviet Union broke apart. Today, there are 
6 million fewer people; by 2050, the population will have fallen to 35 
million. Fertility rates are sharply down, from about 2.0 at the end of 
the 1990s to below 1.5 today, albeit with an upward tick in recent 
years.  The  elderly  dependency  ratio  is  22  percent  and  will  reach 
more than 40 percent over the next 30 years.

The effect of this population aging on jobs is amplified by inter-
national migration. Between the turbulent transition years and the 
middle of the last decade, about 2.5 million Ukrainians emigrated, 
mainly to the Russian Federation and Western Europe. Every year, 
around 80,000 people leave the country,a and recent studies have 
shown  that  the  possible  positive  impacts  of  migration  through 
remittances, return migration, and diaspora involvement have not 
(yet) shown their desired impacts.b People ages 25–29 years, espe-
cially women, are withdrawing in large numbers from the labor mar-
ket: the female participation rate dropped from 78.1 percent to 70.9 
percent between 2001 and 2010.c

Achieving high degrees of efficiency in the labor market is key to 
counterbalancing the impact of aging. But regional labor markets 

show little integration, as reflected by the high dispersion of unem-
ployment rates. In some parts of the country, employers complain 
bitterly about the lack of workers with adequate skills, and at the 
same  time  they  cannot  fill  available  unskilled  jobs.  Yet,  internal 
mobility  is  low  in  Ukraine  by  international  standards  and  has 
declined in recent years. The lack of affordable housing has emerged 
as major barrier to mobility, also hindering registration for benefits 
in new locations. Rental property is scarce, often expensive, and can 
absorb up to 50 percent of household incomes in the big cities.d

Eventually,  Ukraine  may  face  a  vicious  jobs  circle.  A  declining 
labor force and a lackluster productivity performance put the social 
insurance and welfare systems at risk of becoming unsustainable. 
The  inability  to  provide  benefits  to  an  aging  population,  and  the 
stress that reforming the system could bring about, could become a 
source of social tension. As participants in focus group discussions 
mentioned, this tension would be amplified by the perception that 
the distribution of jobs is unfair and that jobs in the public sector 
require bribes.e The decline in employment rates could also under-
mine  civic  engagement.  Although  low,  the  level  of  political  and 
community  participation  among  the  employed  is  about  twice  as 
high as among the unemployed and 25 percent higher than among 
the inactive population.f

The development of home-care models for the 
elderly  can  also  support  the  twin  objectives  of 
keeping a high employment rate and containing 
social  insurance  costs.  Proactively  attracting—
and  integrating—migrants  and  managing  to 
create virtuous circles with the diaspora prom-
ises equally large returns.

Measures such as raising the retirement age 
can contribute to labor force participation and 

financing  of  the  welfare  system,  but  not  all 
groups have the same life expectancy. Typically, 
professional,  technical,  and  skilled  workers 
can  expect  to  live  longer  than  manual  work-
ers, especially those in hazardous occupations. 
Keeping the skilled at work longer is a way to 
increase average labor productivity and offset 
the decline in employment rates.

A targeted investment climate?

Creating an investment climate conducive to job 
creation in the private sector is a top policy pri-
ority. The question is whether the government 
should aim for a level playing field or focus its 
efforts on the specific areas, types of activities, 
firm sizes, and sectors with the greatest poten-
tial  to  create  good  jobs  for  development.  Jobs 
challenges vary depending on a country’s level 
of development, its endowments, its demogra-
phy, and its institutions. Ensuring free entry and 
competition across all sectors is a fundamental 
requisite  for  growth.  But  given  the  often  lim-
ited fiscal space and administrative capacity of 
developing countries, creating an enabling busi-
ness environment across the entire economy can 
be challenging, and the relevant question is how 
policy priorities should be set. 

The  conventional  wisdom  views  targeting 
with a skepticism that stems from often disas-
trous  experiences  with  industrial  policy. While 
targeting was common in Latin America during 
its import substitution phase, by the 1980s the 
consensus was that interventions favoring spe-
cific sectors led to rent seeking, economic stag-
nation, and external vulnerability. Slow growth 
in  India  until  the  1990s  was  also  attributed  to 
policies that favored local industrial groups and 
undermined competition. The success of several 
East Asian countries in industrializing has reig-
nited the debate on the merits of targeting and 
the role of the state, but the potential for institu-
tional failures remains the main concern.118 The 
dominant  view  holds  that  policy  makers  lack 
both the information and the capacity to “pick 
winners” when they select activities to target. In 
the absence of a solid information base, and tak-
ing into account the institutional failures com-
mon in developing countries, a risk exists that 
potential  beneficiaries  from  targeted  support 
could unduly influence the decision process.

Targeting is not necessarily industrial 
policy

The investment climate is the set of public goods 
and public policies that shape the opportunities 
and incentives for firms to invest productively, 
create jobs, and expand.119 It encompasses a wide 

range of policy levers: ensuring stability and se-
curity,  enhancing  financial  markets,  providing 
infrastructure services, reducing regulatory and 
tax  burdens,  and  improving  the  quality  of  the 
workforce. The natural inclination is to equate 
a  targeted  investment  climate  with  industrial 
policy. If some activities result in large produc-
tivity  spillovers  (because  of  learning-by-doing, 
for instance, or because of greater specialization 
and integration), targeting can imply support-
ing such activities. In recent years, productivity 
spillovers associated with various activities have 
been  reexamined  from  different  viewpoints, 
with both academics and practitioners propos-
ing practical approaches for their identification 
(box 6.9). 

The  targeting  of  the  investment  climate 
may not necessarily be aimed at industrial sec-
tors, however. Targeting can focus on gender, as 
when policies aim to increase labor market par-
ticipation by women, or on spatial concerns, as 
in urbanization policies or policies for regional 
development.  Or  it  can  focus  on  firm  size,  as 
when policies support the development of small 
and medium enterprises. Good jobs for devel-
opment differ across countries. The jobs agenda 
may involve making smallholder farming more 
productive in an agrarian economy, preserving 
international competitiveness in a resource-rich 
country,  or  fostering  competition  in  activities 
employing skilled labor in a country with high 
youth unemployment. In each case, the logic for 
targeting  lies  in  tackling  market  imperfections 
or government failures that are preventing jobs 
from contributing more to development.

An  example  is  targeting  in  the  agricultural 
sector.  The  underlying  logic  is  based  on  the  
notion  of  public  goods.  The  biggest  obstacles 
to  agricultural  development  are  the  lack  of 
appropriate  technologies  and  adequate  infra-
structures.  As  arable  land  becomes  scarce,  the 
development of yield-enhancing technologies is 
indispensable.120 But incentives to generate these 
technologies are undermined because they can 
be replicated freely.121 Thus, public policy plays 
a role by supporting the development and dis-
semination of such technologies. Because yield-
enhancing  technologies  are  fertilizer  intensive

BOX 6.9    Once again, the debate rages over industrial policy

Industrial  policy  is  an  approach  to  state  economic  stewardship  in 
which  direct  support  is  given  to  particular  sectors  in  pursuit  of 
national  goals.  Industrial  policy  fell  out  of  favor  in  the  1980s,  but 
today it is getting recognition again. The emerging views, however, 
draw criticism and have led to a new round of debate. 

Arguments  for  industrial  policy  rest  on  three  types  of  market 
failures: knowledge spillovers and dynamic scale economies, coor-
dination failures, and information externalities. In the first, industrial 
policy  is  derived  from  the  observation  that  knowledge  spillovers 
and dynamic scale economies differ across industries. Coordination 
failures arise when markets fail to correctly signal the future payoffs 
of investment projects, such as large-scale infrastructure projects, 
and the private sector tends to underinvest on its own. Information 
externalities  exist  when  knowledge  on  the  profitability  of  invest-
ment opportunities is limited and the risk of free riding discourages 
investment and innovation. 

Building on these rationales, several approaches further develop 
thinking on industrial policy. The New Structural Economics stresses 
the  shift  in  comparative  advantage  that  results  from  changes  in 
endowments. The large productivity spillovers from infrastructure 
and  associated  coordination  failures  justify  a  leading  role  for  the 
state. To identify the industries to be supported, this approach pro-
poses to learn from countries with similar endowments but some-
what  higher  income  levels.  Exports  with  a  solid  track  record  by 
these  countries  indicate  which  sectors  could  have  a  comparative 
advantage as the economy grows.a 

A  second  approach  emphasizes  the  policy  process  and  espe-
cially public-private partnerships. In this view, the dialogue between 
the government and businesses can help to overcome coordination 
failures and elicit information from the private sector on the most 
relevant productivity spillovers.b 

For a third school of thought, what matters is not just any coordi-
nation  failure  or  externality,  but  spillovers  of  productive  knowl-
edge—mastering ways of doing things. Such knowledge is different 
from codified, public knowledge and is acquired and accumulated 
through experience. This approach claims that spillovers of produc-
tive knowledge associated with different industries can be sizable. 
To identify industries worth supporting, the approach proposes to 
rank products by how much productive knowledge is embedded in 
them and to focus on products that are similar to what is being pro-
duced currently but embody a higher knowledge content.c 

Opponents of industrial policy cast doubts on its alleged ratio-
nales, but above all, they question the practicality of its implemen-
tation. For instance, while admitting the existence of potentially siz-
able knowledge spillovers and dynamic scale economies in certain 
industries, skeptics question the whether the public sector has the 
capacity to identify these industries. A related concern is the ability 
of  the  public  sector  to  make  industrial  policy  a  dynamic  process: 
applying credible sunset clauses to old industries, and reallocating 
resources  to  new  industries.  More  generally,  skeptics  believe  the 
knowledge  and  skill  requirements  for  successful  implementation 
exceed the capacity of the public sector. d

and sensitive to the availability of water, public 
investments in infrastructure—including roads 
and irrigation facilities—are often essential. The 
Brazilian  government,  for  example,  viewed  in-
vestment  in  adaptive  agricultural  research  as  a 
prerequisite for development. It therefore sup-
ported a research corporation (EMBRAPA) that 
focused on technology generation and transfer 
and  played  a  critical  role  in  the  success  of  the 
Brazilian agribusiness sector.122

The emergence of dynamic cities is another 
case in point. From Dublin to Shanghai, com-
petitiveness  initiatives  increasingly  involve  cit-
ies,  more  than  countries.  This  shift  is  a  result 
of agglomeration effects: the level playing field 
evokes a flat world, whereas urbanization poli-
cies correspond to a world with spikes of eco-
nomic activity. Dynamic cities may offer more 
favorable  tax  treatment,  easy  access  to  land, 
simplified administrative procedures, and sup-

port for public-private partnerships. More effi-
cient logistics and public investments in major 
infrastructure facilities usually complement the 
package of incentives. A recent version of spatial 
targeting is the idea of charter cities: to attract 
businesses to a country with low credibility in 
the  eyes  of  foreign  investors,  sovereignty  of  a 
city could be handed over to another country in 
exchange for the enforcement of a credible set 
of rules.123 The objective is to strengthen the in-
vestment climate in a small part of the country, 
potentially providing a demonstration effect for

The information base for targeting exists

When  there  is  clarity  on  the  challenges  faced 
by  a  country,  it  is  also  possible  to  determine 
which  types  of  jobs  would  help  address  these

challenges.  Thanks  to  efforts  in  research  and 
data  collection,  the  information  set  for  decid-
ing whether and how to support the creation of 
more of those good jobs for development is far 
from empty. 

Consider  jobs  in  farming.  Among  staple 
crops, rice, wheat, and maize are more promis-
ing than sorghum and millet, but the latter crops 
are grown in drier and harsher conditions where 
farmers are particularly poor.124 Modern cereal 
varieties are high yielding primarily in favorable 
rain-fed  and  irrigated  areas.125  Thus,  agricul-
tural policies are bound to affect the well-being 
of  the  rural  population  differently  in  different 
regions.  The  choice  depends  on  the  country’s 
natural endowments and societal goals.126

In  nonagricultural  sectors,  the  main  obsta-
cles  to  job  creation  can  be  identified  through 
quantitative  and  qualitative  assessments  of  the 
constraints faced by enterprises. While these as-
sessments need to be interpreted with caution, 
differences in responses across enterprises reveal 
patterns  that  can  also  be  used  for  developing 
targeted policy interventions (box 6.10).127

If  creating  competitive  cities  is  a  feature  of 
a country’s jobs agenda, enterprise surveys can 
provide information on how different the con-
straints faced by businesses are in cities of dif-
ferent  sizes  (figure  6.10a).  If  the  jobs  agenda 

requires the inflow of foreign direct investment, 
enterprise surveys indicate that foreign compa-
nies are less concerned about finance, but view 
customs  administration,  transportation,  and 
licensing  as  more  severe  impediments  to  firm 
activity  and  growth  (figure  6.10b).  One  coun-
try  may  choose  to  focus  on  microenterprises, 
because  their  success  contributes  to  poverty 
reduction,  and  another  on  young  and  large 
firms,  because  they  tend  to  be  the  most  inno-
vative. In both cases, enterprise surveys can be 
used  to  uncover  the  most  relevant  constraints 
(figure 6.10c, 6.10d). For example, shortages of 
skilled  labor,  delays  in  customs,  and  stringent 
labor regulations are viewed as more severe con-
straints  by  medium  and  large  enterprises  than 
by  smaller  companies.  In  contrast,  micro-  and 
small enterprises consider access to finance and 
competition  to  be  more  serious  obstacles  to 
their  growth.  Recently,  enterprise  surveys  have 
been  conducted  for  household  enterprises  op-
erating in rural areas in selected countries. They 
can serve as additional tools for countries to fos-
ter nonagricultural sectors in rural areas.128

The  effects  of  removing  those  constraints 
also differ across businesses. Reducing barriers 
to entry fosters the growth of industries that ex-
perience higher natural turnover rates. Improv-
ing access to finance stimulates the development 

BOX 6.10    Caution is needed when interpreting results from enterprise surveys

in 

Surveys  of  entrepreneurs  and  senior  managers  can  provide  feed-
back  on  what  the  private  sector  sees  as  significant  constraints  to 
private  sector  development.  Some  care 
interpreting  their 
responses is necessary, however. The respondents will give answers 
that reflect constraints on their bottom line—without regard to the 
broader societal or welfare implications. Almost every entrepreneur 
will complain that taxes and interest rates on loans are too high. But 
that does not necessarily mean that taxes should be lowered or that 
interest rates are out of line with risks faced by creditors. Constraints 
to  the  individual  respondents  need  to  be  weighed  against  the 
broader social goals.

In  addition,  enterprise  surveys  only  target  incumbent  enter-
prises. The surveys do not reach discouraged entrants and so do not 
ask about the constraints to entry they could not overcome; nor do 
they reach those who recently closed down to ask why they are no 
longer in business. Thus the issues that may have an important role 
in  shaping  who  is  even  asked  the  questions  are  unlikely  to  be 
identified.

Any survey that asks subjective questions has to address issues 
of  comparability  of  responses.  Where  possible,  more  objective 
questions are preferable. Thus, instead of asking how constraining 
the supply of electricity is on a scale of one to five, questions can ask 
for the frequency and length of outages, or the costs of running a 
generator.  These  responses  can  more  easily  be  compared  across 
respondents and over time.

One further complication in interpreting responses from enter-
prise surveys and linking them to enterprise outcomes is the poten-
tial for a two-way causal relationship between them. It could be that 
more onerous conditions are hindering an enterprise’s ability to stay 
in business. But a firm’s poor performance, perhaps stemming from 
weak management, could also be affecting the degree to which the 
respondent complains. Performance also affects which dimensions 
of the investment climate matter the most; for example, the avail-
ability  of  skills  may  be  more  constraining  to  expanding  firms, 
whereas labor regulations may be of greater concern to firms that 
are contracting and facing the need to shed workers.

Note: The analysis is based on a city-level enterprise survey of China in 2005 for panel a, and surveys of more than 60,000 urban enterprises in 104 countries in 2006–10 for other 
panels. The bars indicate differences in the rating of constraints between firms in two groups. Ratings in the surveys range from 1 (no constraint) to 5 (severe); they are net of the 
average rating of constraints by each firm, to assess relative severity. The analysis controls for firm age, size, ownership structure, export orientation, industry, and year.

of industries that rely more on external funding. 
The  impact  of  removing  constraints  also  var-
ies  across  firm  size,  age,  ownership,  and  other 
characteristics.129  For  example,  infrastructure 
bottlenecks tend to stunt the growth of medium 
and large businesses but do not affect microen-
terprises significantly. Similarly, when the judi-
ciary  system  is  viewed  as  a  hindrance,  foreign 

companies are more likely to withdraw from the 
market than private local firms.130

Not all targeting is vulnerable to capture 
by interest groups

Capture by vested interests is arguably the most 
important  concern  about  targeting.  The  risk

that  the  potential  beneficiaries  could  unduly 
influence  the  decision  process  is  a  real  one.  A 
too-cozy  relationship  between  businesses  and 
government  can  make  it  extremely  difficult  to 
remove support, even in the event of a blatant 
failure. Policy capture by vested interest groups 
could  undermine  the  often  weak  capacity  of 
governments in many developing countries. 

Targeted activities that involve a large num-
ber  of  beneficiaries  are  less  subject  to  capture. 
For  example,  support  for  smallholder  farming, 
competitive cities, or female microentrepreneurs 
is  less  likely  to  be  influenced  by  beneficiaries. 
In every country, thousands, if not millions, of 

farmers,  urban  businesses,  and  female  micro-
entrepreneurs  are  all  bound  to  benefit  from 
targeted policies aimed at their group. But indi-
vidually they do not have the power to influence 
such policies, and they may not be able to orga-
nize as effective interest groups.

Targeted government interventions are justi-
fiable  only  if  they  are  based  on  a  solid  under-
standing of what good jobs for development are 
in a particular context and only if they can be 
designed to be resistant to capture. One example 
is  the  involvement  of  the  private  sector  in  the 
design  and  management  of  special  economic 
zones (box 6.11).

BOX 6.11    Special economic zones have a mixed record 

Special  economic  zones  (SEZs)  are  demarcated  geographic  areas 
within a country’s boundaries where the rules of business are differ-
ent from those that prevail in the national territory. These differen-
tial rules principally deal with investment conditions, international 
trade, and customs. The zones have a business environment that is 
intended  to  be  more  liberal  from  a  policy  perspective  and  more 
effective from an administrative perspective.

Before the 1970s, most SEZs were operated by developed coun-
tries. Then, starting with East Asia and Latin America, developing 
countries began to use SEZs to attract foreign direct investment, 
often  as  a  part  of  export-led  growth  strategies.  The  objectives 
broadened over time, as SEZs became instruments of trade, invest-
ment,  industrial,  spatial,  and  even  broader  economic  policies.  In 
1986,  there  were  176  zones  in  47  countries;  by  2006,  there  were 
3,500 of them in 130 countries.

SEZs have a mixed record. Their rates of return are still a topic of 
heated  debate  among  economists.  Their  performance  critically 
depends on their design and management. SEZs are more likely to 
be successful when they are an integral component of the country’s 
development strategy, are aligned with the country’s comparative 
advantage, are cluster-based, and establish linkages with the rest of 
the economy. 

For example, in Bangladesh, the SEZ program initially aimed to 
attract high-technology investments, but the government shifted 
the focus to garments, where the private sector had shown signs of 
success. The shift proved to be critical for the performance of the 
SEZ program. Building effective partnerships with the private sector 
is an important mechanism through which coordination challenges 
can be overcome. Institutionally, the partnership can be established 
through  representation  of  the  private  sector  on  the  board  of  the 
SEZ, as in the Dominican Republic and Lesotho.

A  common  element  of  many  successful  SEZs  is  the  technical 
competency of the bureaucracy responsible for constructing and 
implementing  them.  While  this  cautions  against  targeting  when 
government  capacity  is  weak,  several  Latin  American  countries 
have  recorded  successes  by  relying  on  private  sector  ownership 
and  management.  In  the  Dominican  Republic,  where  public  and 
private zones coexist, there are no clear differences in employment, 
investment, or exports by zone ownership. But the private zones 
generally offer higher-quality infrastructure and more value-added 
services  than  the  government-run  ones  and,  accordingly,  charge 
higher rents.

Connected jobs agendas

The migration of people matches opportunities across borders.  
Globalization is leading to a growing international migration of jobs  
not only in manufacturing but also, increasingly, in services.

Different  countries  face  different  jobs 

challenges,  but  their  jobs  agendas  are 
interconnected by two forces—the mi-
gration  of  people  and  the  migration  of  jobs. 
These  two  flows  have  consequences  for  living 
standards,  productivity,  and  social  cohesion  in 
sending and receiving countries. The arrival of 
migrants or the outsourcing of jobs abroad af-
fects the living standards of both migrants and 
locals.  The  availability  of  foreign  workers,  the 
development  of  migrant  networks  channeling 
savings  and  ideas,  and  the  arrival  of  multina-
tional firms bringing more advanced techniques 
are all bound to increase productivity. But fam-
ily structures as well as community life are af-
fected by the movement of people and jobs. The 
potential  gains  are  considerable,  but  there  are 
also tradeoffs.

Even  if  development  strategies  succeed  in 
addressing jobs challenges at the country level, 
mismatches between employment opportuni-
ties  at  home  and  abroad  are  bound  to  occur, 
encouraging people to leave their communities 
and try their chances elsewhere. Almost inevi-
tably, the international migration of people will 
be one of the policy levers to consider in South 
Asia and in Sub-Saharan Africa, given the pro-
jected rapid growth in the labor force in these 
regions  over  the  coming  decades.  Migration 
trends will be driven not only by demographic 
pressures but also by cultural and geographic 
proximity, as well as economic factors. 

Jobs  agendas  are  also  connected  through 
the international migration of jobs. The splin-
tering  of  production  tasks  has  facilitated  their 
delocalization  and  outsourcing  to  developing 
countries,  resulting  in  greater  trade  volumes 
and lower prices of final goods. But it has also 
led to a global redistribution of jobs in manu-
facturing,  and  the  same  trend  is  increasingly 
visible in services as well. So far, the migration 
of jobs out of industrial countries has mainly af-
fected blue-collar workers, but white-collar jobs 
are  following.  These  are  not  once-and-for-all 
moves.  Growing  labor  costs  in Asia  may  open 
up opportunities for other developing countries 
to jump-start industrialization.

Migration of workers

Precise  figures  on  the  global  number  of  inter-
national  migrants  are  not  available,  an  unsur-
prising fact given that a number of them cross 
borders illegally or do not return once their visas 
and permits expire. That is why estimates tend 
to  rely  on  population  censuses  and  household 
surveys. Even then, differences across countries 
in the way that data are gathered, and in the way 
legislation  defines  nationality  and  migratory 
status, make accurate counts difficult.1 The or-
ders of magnitude are relatively uncontroversial,  
however. There are more than 200 million mi-
grants  worldwide,  and  90  million  of  them  are

workers. Migrants represent between 2.5 and 3 
percent of the world’s population and the global 
labor  force.2  Many  are  temporary  or  seasonal 
workers and return to their home country.

Global patterns of migration

Global figures hide important differences across 
countries. Some countries are mainly recipients, 
while others are sources, and yet others neither 
host nor send significant numbers of migrants 

(map  7.1).  In  a  few  relatively  small  recipient 
countries,  the  foreign-born  population  makes 
up more than 40 percent of the total population. 
Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, and Singapore are 
in this group. Among bigger recipient countries, 
those  with  the  largest  share  of  immigrants  in 
their  population  are  Saudi  Arabia  (27.8  per-
cent),  Canada  (21.3  percent),  Australia  (21.0 
percent), and the United States (13.5 percent). 
In  absolute  numbers,  the  United  States  is  the 
largest recipient of migrants, with 42.8 million,

followed  by  the  Russian  Federation  (12.3  mil-
lion), and Germany (10.8 million). Among the 
sending countries, those with the largest num-
bers of migrants are Mexico (10.1 million), In-
dia (9.1 million), and Bangladesh (6.0 million).3 
Russia is so high on the list, because many eth-
nic Russians live in countries that were formerly 
part of the Soviet Union.

Political  turmoil  and  globalization  acceler-
ated migration flows in the first half of the 20th 
century. The partition of Bangladesh, India, and 
Pakistan involved large numbers of people liv-
ing in countries different from their birthplace. 
The decline of transportation costs, the growth 
of  Persian  Gulf  economies  following  surges  in 
oil prices, and the entry into world markets of 
developing  countries  with  large  populations 
have all stimulated a surge of migrant workers 
worldwide.

Differences in expected earnings between the 
country of origin and the country of destination 
are an important reason for people to migrate. 
Earnings  gains,  however,  are  offset  to  varying 
degrees  by  the  direct  costs  of  migration  (such 
as  transportation  fees  and  intermediation  ser-
vices) as well as by indirect costs associated with 
the difficulties of adapting to a different culture 
and society and leaving family and friends be-
hind.  These  costs  also  help  explain  aggregate 
migration  flows.  For  many  migrants,  physical 
and  cultural  proximity  (including  a  common 
language, religion, or way of life) are important 
when choosing a host country. Concerns about 
employment opportunities and personal safety 
in  the  sending  countries  are  other  important, 
sometimes  crucial,  drivers  of  migration.  More 
than  10  million  migrants  are  refugees,  and 
nearly 2 million are asylum seekers.4 

The growth rate in the global number of mi-
grant  workers  peaked  between  2005  and  2008 
and then decelerated because of the impact of the 
global economic crisis. During previous decades, 
the  growth  in  migration  flows  came  primarily 
from South-North flows; that is, from develop-
ing  to  developed  countries.  South-South  mi-
gration,  although  numerically  larger,  remained 
stable over that period.5

Skilled workers represent a growing share of 
international  migration.  Developed  countries 
increasingly implement policies to attract talent.  
Between  1990  and  2000,  the  share  of  workers 

with at least some tertiary education among im-
migrants increased from 15 to 25 percent in the 
United Kingdom, and from 25 to 30 percent in 
the United States. Stark country differences are 
also present in skilled labor migration. Some de-
veloping  countries  explicitly  promote  emigra-
tion  of  skilled  workers,  while  others  complain 
about  “brain  drain.”  More  than  70  percent  of 
citizens with tertiary education in Haiti, Jamaica, 
and Trinidad and Tobago live abroad. The share 
of  skilled  workers  among  migrants  is  particu-
larly high in African countries (map 7.2).6

Highly  skilled  migrants  fall  into  a  range 
of  categories  including  technology  and  busi-
ness creators, scientists, scholars, students, and 
health and cultural workers. At 10 percent, their 
share of total migration is still relatively small, 
but 90 percent of them live in industrial coun-
tries.7  In  some  occupations,  the  concentration 
of  skilled  migrants  is  substantial:  27  percent 
of  all  physicians  in  the  United  States,  21  per-
cent in Australia, and 20 percent in Canada are 
foreign-trained.8 

Impacts on sending and receiving 
countries

The most direct impact of international migra-
tion is on living standards. Through their work 
in receiving countries, and through remittances 
to sending countries, migrants increase their in-
comes and those of their families. Migrants also 
contribute  to  global  output  if  their  productiv-
ity abroad is higher than it was at home, which 
may often be the case. They can even contribute 
to  output  in  the  sending  country,  as  networks 
of migrants and returnees serve as channels for 
investment, innovation, and expertise. Social ef-
fects are mixed, however. On the positive side, 
migration  connects  people  from  different  cul-
tures  in  ways  bound  to  widen  their  horizons. 
On  the  negative  side,  separation  from  family 
and friends can be a source of distress and iso-
lation in the recipient country. Large numbers 
of  immigrants  can  also  exacerbate  frustration 
among vulnerable groups in recipient countries, 
if foreigners are seen as competitors for jobs and 
public services.

The  increase  in  earnings  from  migration 
may amount to tens of thousands of dollars per 
worker  per  year.  After  controlling  for  worker

characteristics,  the  gain  may  range  from  50 
percent to more than double the difference in 
income  per  capita  between  the  host  and  the 
sending countries.9,10 Transportation costs and 
rents taken by intermediaries can reduce these 
gains, however. In some cases, these intermedi-
aries are part of illegal organizations linked to 
trafficking of people and criminal abuses, mak-

ing  migrants  a  particularly  vulnerable  group. 
In  others,  intermediaries  are  informal  agents 
who provide market-priced migration services 
in the absence of other formal mechanisms to 
address  the  existence  of  demand  and  supply 
for migration.11 Migrants also face psychologi-
cal and physical health risks, often without ac-
cess to health insurance.12 The persistent flows 

236 

  WO R L D   D E V E LO P M E N T   R E P O RT   2 0 1 3

of  migration  would  indicate,  though,  that  the 
large  gains,  actual  and  expected,  more  than 
compensate for the costs.

Evidence on the impact of migration on la-
bor outcomes in sending countries is scattered. 
If employment opportunities for those who mi-
grate  were  limited,  earnings  and  employment 
would remain unaltered. If they were plentiful, 
earnings rise and the participation rates of previ-
ously  inactive  persons  would  increase.  Studies 
for Mexico, Pakistan, and the Philippines show 
that out-migration did affect wages and unem-
ployment  rates  in  the  sending  country,  but  no 
discernable effects on labor outcomes have been 
found in Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka.13 

The  net  effects  of  migration  flows  on  em-
ployment opportunities and labor earnings de-
pend  on  the  skills  and  the  jobs  of  those  who 
move abroad. A recent study using data for high- 
and   middle-income economies shows that im-
migration of high-skill workers has positive ef-
fects on wages of both high- and low-skill local 
workers. On the other hand, emigration of more 
educated workers is associated with declines in 
wages for both low- and high-skill workers who 
remain in the country of origin.14 

Remittances are an important source of in-
come  for  households  in  sending  countries,  al-
though they do not necessarily reach the poorest 
of  the  poor.  In  different  countries,  an  increase 
in  international  remittances  is  associated  with 
declines  in  the  share  of  people  living  in  pov-
erty.15  Remittances  also  increase  savings  and 
investment in recipient families.16 And they are 
more resilient than is generally believed. Recent 
studies show that despite tougher conditions for 
migrants during the 2009 recession, remittances 
dipped only slightly.17 Results are mixed on the 
impact  of  remittances  on  income  inequality. 
Some studies find that migrants come from the 
middle  of  the  income  (or  wealth)  distribution 
and  that,  in  the  short  term,  remittances  leave 
overall inequality unaltered. Others show that in 
the medium term inequality decreases, because 
of the higher economic activity in localities with 
migrants.18 Most studies also report that remit-
tances  reduce  labor  force  participation  among 
migrants’ relatives.19

The  growing  migration  trend  among  the 
highly skilled raises concerns about the implica-

tions for developing countries. Some fear a brain 
drain, whereby developing countries would suf-
fer from the loss of valuable human resources. 20 
According to this view, developing countries put 
considerable fiscal resources into the education 
of these workers, with the intention of enhanc-
ing their productivity and creating an elite of in-
novators, thinkers, and administrators. Thus the 
migration of skilled workers not only creates a 
fiscal and distributive concern in the short term, 
but it also impairs the growth capacities of the 
country in the long term. In this view, develop-
ing countries should create incentives for skilled 
workers to return to their home country, for ex-
ample, through financial reforms of secondary 
and tertiary education. 

Others, however, see a “brain gain,” whereby 
developing  countries  benefit  from  networks, 
return migration, and the incentives for young 
people  to  improve  their  skills.  Returning  mi-
grants bring home entrepreneurial and technical 
capacities that enhance productivity in sending 
countries. Experience acquired abroad has been 
found  to  induce  higher  wages  among  salaried 
workers and higher productive efficiency among 
entrepreneurs in several countries.21 Beyond the 
individual benefits are societal benefits that may 
extend to the proliferation of a whole industry 
and the creation of new jobs in an entire local-
ity. Bangalore and Hyderabad in India illustrate 
this point: returning migrants set up informa-
tion technology and communication companies 
to  take  advantage  of  their  previous  experience 
and their links with international companies.22 
The  presence  of  highly  qualified  Indian  engi-
neers and executives in U.S. corporations paved 
the way for the rise of the Indian software indus-
try.23 The activities of migrant networks are not 
restricted to skilled migrants or corporate activ-
ities. Networks of Mexican low-skill workers in 
the United States have worked with the Mexican 
government to redirect and enhance public in-
vestment in infrastructure in their communities 
of origin.24

Networks  of  migrants  can  also  be  impor-
tant  sources  of  foreign  direct  investment  and 
know-how, both of which promote productivity 
growth in sending countries. It is estimated that 
Chinese  migrants  contributed  more  than  half 
of all foreign direct investment in China.25 The

impact of returning migrants on their commu-
nities may be more modest in smaller countries 
that lack the scale for the development of new 
vibrant businesses.26

The  increase  in  talent  migration  may  also 
bring a brain gain through its impact on human 
capital accumulation in sending countries. The 
prospect of migration raises the returns to edu-
cation  and,  thus,  fosters  investment  in  human 
capital.  However,  these  positive  effects  depend 
on the size of skill migration and the relative size 
of  the  country.  Recent  evidence  indicates  that 
large countries with low rates of high-skill emi-
gration experience a net gain in human capital. 
In  contrast,  small  countries  with  high  rates  of 
high-skill emigration suffer a net loss.27 

Social impacts are more diverse. In sending 
countries,  researchers  find  changes  in  gender 
and  family  relations  as  well  as  in  political  at-
titudes.  But  the  nature  of  these  changes  de-
pends  on  the  country.  In  some  cases,  women 
and  children  are  empowered  by  the  migration 
of spouses and parents; in others, they become 
more  vulnerable.28  Migrants  to  societies  that 
value liberty and democracy come to appreciate 
these values, whereas those in more traditional 
host  countries  may  become  more  traditional 
themselves.29 

In host countries, most studies have concen-
trated on the influence of migrants on the em-
ployment  and  earnings  of  locals,  as  well  as  on 
the fiscal consequences of migrant inflows. The 
majority  of  these  studies  finds  either  no  effect 
or a very small negative effect on the average la-
bor earnings of the locals. But the composition 
of  employment  between  locals  and  migrants 
shifts,  creating  winners  and  losers.30  The  fiscal 
consequences for host countries depend on the 
characteristics  of  the  migrants.  The  younger 
and  more  skilled  they  are,  the  higher  the  tax 
revenues.  The  impact  of  government  spend-
ing  in  host  countries  varies,  depending  on  the 
duration of migration and the family composi-
tion of the migrants. Computations of the net 
effect on the welfare systems of recipient coun-
tries are sensitive to hypotheses and estimation 
methods.31 

Last but not least, migration may also bring 
racial prejudice and exacerbate social tensions in 
host countries. This happens when migrants are 

secluded  in  segregated  occupations  or  neigh-
borhoods, preventing their genuine integration 
in society.32 It may also occur when migrants are 
perceived as competing for “nonmigrant” jobs. 
Prejudice and tensions may result in distrust of 
migrants and lead to the hardening of legal re-
quirements for entering the host country, forced 
repatriations, and even the building of physical 
walls to prevent migration. These policies may 
not  ease  tensions  unless  a  more  comprehen-
sive approach is adopted. Irregular or undocu-
mented migration is growing, partly in reaction 
to  the  lack  of  legal  alternatives  to  migration 
given  the  mounting  mismatches  between  em-
ployment opportunities in sending and receiv-
ing countries.33

Migration of jobs

Quantifying the international migration of jobs 
is even more difficult than estimating the global 
number of international migrants. The past four 
decades have been marked by the delocalization 
and  outsourcing  of  manufacturing  tasks  from 
industrial  countries  to  the  developing  world, 
especially to East Asia. More recently, the same 
pattern is observed for tasks in the services sec-
tor.  In  fact,  exports  of  services  are  the  fastest-
growing  component  of  global  trade.  And  the 
share  originating  in  developing  countries  has 
been growing steadily over the past two decades. 
But counting how many jobs are affected glob-
ally is not feasible, because the process involves 
job destruction in some countries and job cre-
ation  in  others,  in  ways  that  cannot  be  easily 
matched with each other.

The  share  of  manufacturing  in  total  employ-

industrial  countries  declined  by 
roughly  one-third  between  1970  and  2008,  as 
did its share in gross domestic product (GDP) 
(figure  7.1).34  Although  starting  from  higher  
levels,  the  pattern  was  the  same  in  Japan  as  in 
Europe  and  North  America.  The  Republic  of  
Korea industrialized in the 1970s and 1980s, but 
the  share  of  manufacturing  in  its  employment 
and GDP started declining in 1992. Meanwhile,

the share of manufacturing in total employment 
increased steadily in other East Asian countries, 
including China, for four decades. In South Asia 
and Sub-Saharan Africa, the share has been low 
and  stagnant,  whereas  it  has  declined  in  Latin 
America  and  increased  in  Eastern  Europe  and 
Central  Asia.  The  overall  pattern  is  one  where 
manufacturing  jobs  migrated  primarily  from 
Western Europe and the United States to North-
east Asia and then to the rest of East Asia.

The East Asian trends are consistent with the 
“flying  geese”  pattern  of  development,  where 
economic  transformation  is  consistent  with 
dynamic  changes  in  comparative  advantage. 
Industrialization in East Asian countries began 
with the development of labor-intensive sectors, 
gradually shifted to capital-intensive sectors, and 
then to knowledge-intensive activities. In paral-
lel, wages rose and skills increased.35 First Japan, 
then Korea, and more recently China followed a 
similar pattern. As labor costs increase further, 
light  manufacturing  jobs  are  likely  to  migrate 
away from coastal China, where most industries 
have  concentrated.  By  some  estimates,  nearly 
100 million jobs are at stake.36

The  migration  of  light  manufacturing  jobs 
out  of  coastal  China  could  open  a  once-in-a-
generation  opportunity  for  countries  in  Sub-
Saharan  Africa  and  South  Asia  to  jump-start 
their industrialization. But some observers pre-
dict that the migration will go mainly to the in-
land areas in China, where wage rates are lower 
than  on  the  coast.  This  would  be  consistent 
with the patterns of industrialization in Japan; 
Korea;  Taiwan,  China;  and  the  United  States, 
where the initial geographical concentration of 
industries was followed by dispersion within the 
same country.37 However, China’s labor market 
is relatively integrated to the point where even 
unskilled wage rates in rural areas have been in-
creasing rapidly.38 Therefore, an overall decline 
in  the  manufacturing  share  of  GDP  in  China 
might  be  unavoidable,  opening  up  the  oppor-
tunity  for  labor-intensive  industrialization  in 
other developing countries.39 

The  rapid  growth  of  labor  productivity  in 
manufacturing is resulting in the stagnation or 
even the decline of the number of manufactur-
ing jobs worldwide (figure 7.2). Global employ-
ment  in  manufacturing  increased  by  only  30 
percent from 1990 to 2008, with most of the ex-
pansion taking place in Asia, especially in China.

port markets and global value chains more than 
other jobs and are thus more likely to generate 
productivity externalities, this stagnation or de-
cline raises the prospect of a fierce international 
competition  ahead  (question  7).  If  aggregate 
numbers  of  manufacturing  jobs  are  bound  to 
remain relatively stable, successful industrializa-
tion in one region may come at the expense of 
industrial employment in another region.

Manufacturing could take off in South Asia 
or Sub-Saharan Africa if technology and man-
agement knowledge were transferred there. Such 
a transfer, however, is not simple: fostering en-
trepreneurship, nurturing a more skilled work-
force,  creating  a  stronger  investment  climate, 
and  establishing  a  more  favorable  institutional 
environment  would  be  necessary.  There  is  also 
a risk of focusing on industries that are not in 
line  with  the  potential  comparative  advantage 
of these regions.40 Combined with poor logistics 
and weak government capacity, that could mean 
that few manufacturing jobs would actually mi-
grate to these regions. Studies on the locational 
decisions  of  multinational  corporations  show 
that many factors come into play (box 7.1).

Services were once regarded largely as non-
tradable,  but  this  is  no  longer  the  case.  Both 
 country-specific and global trends show a grow-

ing share of employment and GDP in services, 
some  of  which  are  sold  across  borders.41  New 
ways of delivering services, often broken down 
into small tasks and driven by information and 
communication  technology  (ICT),  are  trans-
forming where service activities can be located 
(box 7.2). The world share of developing coun-
tries in global exports of services increased from 
11 percent in 1990 to 21 percent in 2008. Ser-
vices are now the main contributor to economic 
growth in many developing countries, including 
India.42 

The  rapid  expansion  of  trade  in  services  is 
bound to increase productivity on a global scale. 
But it also is raising fears in developed countries 
that service sector jobs will migrate to develop-
ing  countries  through  offshoring  or  interna-
tional outsourcing, much the same as manufac-
turing jobs did over the past four decades.

A  telltale  sign  of  the  potential  for  offshor-
ing  and  outsourcing  is  the  substantial  number 
of service sector tasks already being performed 
remotely  within  industrial  countries.43  In  the 
United States, service occupations that are trad-
able by nature, such as computer systems design 
and  management  consulting,  display  a  heavy  
geographic  concentration.  This  concentration 
results  partly  from  agglomeration  economies,

BOX 7.1    Why do multinationals locate where they do?

Where multinationals locate provides insights into the critical char-
acteristics in a host country that firms want or need. Traditionally, 
foreign direct investment (FDI) was categorized either as horizon-
tal—multinationals  seeking  better  access  to  larger  markets  over-
seas—or vertical—multinationals moving part of their production 
to a lower-cost location. As trade barriers and transportation costs 
have fallen and supply chains involve ever more specialized tasks, 
the importance of locating near the final market has diminished. But 
the  empirical  patterns  show  that  “costs”  need  to  be  determined 
over a range of dimensions. 

The location-decision question has been examined empirically 
by looking at how the characteristics of host countries predict the 
inflow  of  FDI  and  entry  of  multinationals.  Significant  macroeco-
nomic instability or conflict disqualifies most locations. Low wages 
can be attractive, but given that labor is often a small share of over-
all manufacturing costs, they are often not the predominant consid-
eration.  And  labor  costs  cannot  be  evaluated  separately  from  the 
quality of skills; developed countries remain significant destinations 
of FDI in part because of their highly skilled workforces. Access to 
land,  particularly  in  parts  of  Africa  and  Asia  where  land  access  is 
more regulated, can be a significant consideration. Poor or inconsis-
tent public services, including electricity, security, and transporta-
tion  infrastructure,  can  quickly  raise  costs—through  delays,  lost 
production, and the expense of privately providing these services. 

Costs associated with complying with business regulations and with 
taxes can also be important, as are the reliability and cost of contract 
enforcement  institutions.  The  literature  shows  that  the  relative 
importance of these dimensions often varies by different types of 
sectors, the degree of capital intensity, and technological sophisti-
cation. The presence of other firms is also a consideration. Quick and 
reliable access to suppliers can reduce costs and delays.

In addition to the academic literature, a number of consulting 
firms  provide  analysis  and  rankings  of  the  attractiveness  of  coun-
tries  based  on  the  views  of  top  executives  of  multinationals.  A.T. 
Kearney  has  published  a  Foreign  Direct  Investment  Index  since 
1998.  Three  dimensions  emerge  as  critical  in  its  analysis:  well- 
functioning financial markets, a strong business environment, and 
strong labor skills. A separate index for the location of services also 
emphasizes  skills,  particularly  language  skills,  and  the  degree  of 
global  integration.  Labor  typically  accounts  for  a  larger  share  of 
overall costs in services than in  manufacturing.

The evolution of supply chains into more specialized tasks oper-
ating across more diverse locations can offer opportunities for an 
increasing number of developing countries. Multinationals are not 
looking for a strong business environment across the board; they 
care about inputs and services that are specific to their needs and 
thus are location-specific.

BOX 7.2    E-links create job opportunities in developing countries, but the scale is still modest

Internet  services  are  becoming  ever  more  accessible,  including  in 
the  developing  world.  Crowd sourcing  tools  help  businesses  to 
break  up  larger  tasks  into  many  smaller  discrete  steps.  These  are 
then  offered  to  a  global  online  community  through  competition. 
The  platform  TopCoder,  for  example,  brings  together  close  to 
400,000 programmers globally.

A special type of online outsourcing, branded impact sourcing 
by some, aims to bring employment and supplementary income to 
low-income areas. Impact sourcing is estimated to represent 4 per-
cent of the entire business process outsourcing industry, account-
ing  for  US$4.5  billion  in  total  revenues  and  employing  around 
140,000 people around the globe. Sama source is a nonprofit organi-
zation based in San Francisco, working with major technology cli-
ents. It splits large projects into “micro work”—small tasks that can 
be done online using inexpensive computers—and distributes the 
tasks largely to women working with partner service providers in 
the poorest parts of the world, including remote villages, slums, and 

refugee  camps  in  countries,  such  as  Haiti,  Pakistan,  Uganda,  and 
others. Data workers develop skills in  English, computers, and a vari-
ety of project-specific tasks. Samasource has reached 1,600 women 
and youth over the past three years. 

Similarly,  RuralShores  aims  to  bring  rural  India  into  the  global 
knowledge world. It provides remote processing of noncritical busi-
ness transactions such as data entry, simple bookkeeping, expenses 
handling,  and  document  digitalization  and  archiving. RuralShores 
runs 10 centers in 7 Indian states, employing about 1,000 people. 
The centers, run as for-profit entities, are all located in remote Indian 
villages. While most employees are high-school graduates, the com-
pany  gives  preference  to  people  with  disabilities  and  young  job-
seekers  from  poor,  agrarian  families.  Impact  sourcing  does  face 
challenges that include access to clients and contracts, sustainable 
demand, robust infrastructure, effective recruitment, and identifica-
tion of investors.

supporting  specialization.  But  simple  geo-
graphic  imbalances  between  the  local  supply 
and demand for services also contribute to re-
mote provision.

Trade in services can be expected to expand 
rapidly in the coming years. Until recently, it was 
thought  that  only  labor-intensive  tasks  would 
be relocated to developing countries, allowing 
production in industrial countries to focus on 
capital- or skill-intensive tasks.44 However, de-
veloping countries are now exporting not only 
traditional services, such as transportation and 
tourism,  but  also  modern  and  skill-intensive 
services, such as financial intermediation, com-
puter  and  information  services,  and  legal  and 
technical support.45 Skilled jobs performed by 
accountants,  programmers,  designers,  archi-
tects, medical diagnosticians, and financial and 
statistical  analysts  are  increasingly  outsourced 
by firms in industrial countries.46 In India, the 
number  of  such  skilled  white-collar  jobs  has 
grown rapidly.47 However, some of the service 
jobs seen as skilled in developing countries are 
considered unskilled in industrial countries.48

India  was  a  developing  world  pioneer  in 
building a modern export-oriented services sec-
tor,  but  other  countries—Brazil,  Chile,  China, 
and Malaysia, to name a few—have also seized 
the  opportunity.49  But  outsourcing  does  not 
only  happen  between  industrial  and  develop-
ing  countries.  In  the  United  States  (the  largest 
offshoring economy), 85 percent of the service 
trade is with other industrial countries.50 Two-
thirds of service sector exports from developing 
countries are actually South-South trade.51 

Developing  countries  tend  to  specialize  in 
certain activities within the services sector. For 
example,  Brazil,  Costa  Rica,  and  Uruguay  are 
strong in professional and ICT-related services; 
Chile  in  distribution  and  transportation  ser-
vices; Mexico in communication and distribu-
tion  services;  and  Sub-Saharan  African  coun-
tries in professional services.52 This diversity in 
specialization  will  likely  lead  to  both  competi-
tion  and  cooperation,  involving  different  seg-
ments of the services sector, rather than a head-
on collision between industrial and developing 
countries. 

This new phase of globalization is bound to 
influence views and interpretations about struc-
tural transformation and the migration of jobs. 

Some  researchers  claim  that  a  “revolution”  is 
under  way  that  is  turning  services  sectors  into 
the main engine of economic growth in devel-
oping countries.53 Others argue that developing 
countries such as India and the Philippines are 
successful in exporting relatively skill-intensive 
services  not  because  of  their  comparative  ad-
vantage in such services but because of policies 
preventing  their  manufacturing  sectors  from 
taking off.54 Given the stagnation of global em-
ployment  in  manufacturing  and  the  growing 
trade in services, a relevant question is whether 
developing  countries  can  successfully  skip  the 
industrialization phase of development.

Winners and losers

The  obvious  winners  of  globalization  are  the 
workers  and  entrepreneurs  in  countries  to 
which industries and splintered tasks have mi-
grated. Outsourcing and offshoring, along with 
the attendant transfer of new technologies and 
advanced  management  methods,  contributes 
to  productivity  growth  and  improvements  in 
living standards. The development of more ef-
ficient industries and services encourage a real-
location of labor toward more productive uses. 
It  also  stimulates  the  subsequent  development 
of  other  interrelated  industries  and  sectors 
through  backward  and  forward  linkages.  The 
development  of  a  modern  services  sector  can 
lead to greater coordination in value chains and 
make a further subdivision of tasks and the re-
organization of production possible, leading to 
economies  of  scale.55  Multiple  actors—includ-
ing  multinationals,  civil  society  organizations 
and  consumers  in  industrial  countries—are 
increasingly active in efforts to improve work-
ing conditions and workers’ rights in developing 
countries.  To  the  extent  that  such  efforts  bear 
fruit,  enhanced  export  opportunities  improve 
workers’ well-being.56 In all these ways, signifi-
cant  trickle-down  effects  can  have  widespread 
benefits for recipient countries. 

The hidden winners from the migration of 
jobs are consumers at large. The improved in-
ternational division of labor expands the global 
availability  of  goods  and  services,  improving 
living standards around the world.57 This point 
can be easily understood by thinking how the 
world would look if China and India could not 

242 

  WO R L D   D E V E LO P M E N T   R E P O RT   2 0 1 3

provide cheap goods and services to the rest of 
the world.

The obvious losers are those who have lost 
their  jobs  because  of  the  declining  competi-
tiveness  of  the  industries  and  services  where 
they used to work. While skilled workers may 
easily find similar occupations in other indus-
tries without a loss in salary, many low-skilled 
workers  are  not  so  fortunate.  Low-skilled 
workers or those with industry- or occupation- 
specific skills that are no longer in demand are 
more likely to be forced to accept lower-paying 
jobs  in  different  industries  or  remain  unem-
ployed.58 Job losses could become a serious is-
sue  not  only  in  industrial  countries  but  also 
in dynamically growing developing countries, 
such as China, as their labor costs increase.

There  are  also  hidden  losers.  These  are  the 
workers  and  entrepreneurs  in  countries  which 
have  failed  to  develop  new  industries  and  ser-
vices connected to world markets and the jobs 
that go with them.59 Workers in those countries, 
however, may not perceive the lost employment 
opportunities.60

One way to mitigate the welfare losses from 
globalization,  both  apparent  and  hidden,  is 
through the international migration of work-
ers.  Income  differentials  across  countries, 
which reflect differences in the growth rates of 
different  economies,  are  important  drivers  of 
this  migration.  By  reallocating  workers  from 
stagnant or slowly growing economies to rap-
idly growing ones, the international migration 
of workers contributes to the reduction in the 

income gap created by the international migra-
tion of jobs. But jobs tend to migrate more eas-
ily than people. 

*   *   *

The  migration  of  people  and  the  migration  of 
jobs make clear that jobs challenges, despite being 
country specific, can also be global in scope. Both 
sending and recipient countries can benefit from 
these  international  movements  in  a  variety  of 
ways, from higher labor earnings to remittances, 
from  greater  productivity  to  broader  networks. 
Consumers worldwide also benefit from less ex-
pensive consumer goods. Tensions and costs are 
associated  with  these  two  migrations,  however. 
Migrant workers may suffer discrimination and 
segregation or lose their family and cultural con-
nections and identity, disrupting not only their 
own sense of well-being but also have an impact 
on communities in origin and host countries.

The migration of people and the migration 
of jobs may transform entire communities, cre-
ating  winners  and  losers.  Many  see  their  lives 
improve, but those who lose their jobs to out-
sourcing and offshoring may experience perma-
nent declines in well-being, especially if they are 
unskilled.  These  spillovers,  positive  and  nega-
tive,  are  powerful  motivators  for  the  political 
and  social  groups  that  promote  or  oppose  the 
migration of people and of jobs. But these spill-
overs are international in nature, so coping with 
them only through national policy instruments 
may prove unsatisfactory. 

QUeStION 7

Competing for jobs?

Many developing countries face a jobs agenda. 
In  some,  it  involves  offering  avenues  to  rural 
populations to move out of poverty. In others, 
it  aims  at  leveraging  the  gains  from  urbaniza-
tion and from integration in global markets. Yet 
in others, the goal is to prevent youth from be-
coming disenfranchised or to reduce the risk of 
conflict.  These  agendas  are  addressed  through 
national policies that stimulate job creation by 
the  private  sector,  especially  in  the  areas  and 
activities where development payoffs are high-
est. But jobs agendas of individual countries are 
connected through globalization: trade in goods 
and services, investment flows, and migration of 
workers. This begs the question: if jobs can mi-
grate from one country to another, do policies 
to support job creation in one country become 
policies affecting jobs in other countries—poli-
cies competing for jobs globally? 

Among  economists,  the  conventional  wis-
dom  is  that  the  number  of  jobs  is  not  deter-
mined  by  international  trade  and  investment 
but by the total number of people in the labor 
force. And in general, openness to international 
trade and foreign direct investment is beneficial 
for  all  the  countries  involved.  Thus,  globaliza-
tion  is  not  a  zero-sum  game.  From  this  point 
of view, policies to support job creation are not 
policies  competing  for  jobs,  even  as  they  may 
alter the global flows of trade, investment, and 
workers. 

The general public seems to have a less san-
guine view of the situation. Representative pub-
lic opinion polls show that firm relocation and 
tasks outsourced abroad are seen as a threat to 
employment  in  industrial  countries  (box  7.3). 
Globalization  is  perceived  as  a  head-to-head 
competition in which employment gains in one 
country can be achieved only at the expense of 
jobs in other countries.

There is merit to both views. Past the short-
term impact of outsourcing and delocalization, 
the total number of jobs in one country should 
not be substantially affected by policy decisions 
in other countries. Some firms may close or start 
activities,  others  may  expand  or  contract  their 
business, but total employment will be roughly 

determined by the size of the labor force. How-
ever, the composition of employment is bound 
to  change.  The  concern  is  that  the  share  of 
good jobs for development may decline in one 
country and increase in another. Whether that 
happens  depends  on  the  nature  of  good  jobs 
for  development  and  the  types  of  national 
policies being adopted to support job creation. 
While the public’s concern is legitimate, not all 
measures to support job creation amount to a 
 beggar-thy-neighbor policy. 

Not a competition for total employment 
but for its composition 

International  trade  and  investment  can  be  ex-
pected to lead to greater prosperity. Globaliza-
tion, including firm relocation and outsourcing, 
may  result  in  job  losses  at  home  in  the  short 
term, but the demand for labor should increase 
in the longer run, as specialization generates ef-
ficiency gains in both industrial and developing 
countries.61 Lower prices for goods and services, 
and  a  growing  consumption  demand  from 
emerging countries as they prosper, can only re-
inforce the upward trend in the global demand 
for labor. 

Empirical  evidence  to  a  large  extent  con-
firms  this  upbeat  assessment.  Labor  earnings 
and  working  conditions  improve  as  countries 
grow  richer,  and  global  integration  has  been 
good  for  growth. Across  developing  countries, 
a  1  percent  increase  in  a  country’s  openness, 
measured as the share of its foreign trade in its 
output, has been associated with a 1 percent in-
crease in GDP per capita.62 Gains may reach up 
to 1.5 percentage points on average in the case of 
openness in financial services and telecommu-
nications.63 Even in Sub-Saharan Africa, where 
trade liberalization was viewed with skepticism, 
the increase in output growth rates could be in 
the range of 0.5 to 0.8 percent.64 Evidence also 
shows that firms engaged in global markets pay 
higher  wages.  This  is  true  of  exporting  firms 
from  Colombia  to  Morocco  and  from  Mexico 
to Korea. It is also true of foreign-owned com-
panies,  whether  they  operate  in  Cameroon  or

BOX 7.3    Globalization is often viewed as jobs migrating abroad

Across  European  countries,  popular  perceptions  can  be  inferred 
from the Eurobarometer surveys. One of its questions is the follow-
ing: “What comes first to mind when you hear the word ‘globaliza-
tion’?” The options for answering this question are opportunities for 
domestic  companies  in  terms  of  new  outlets;  foreign  investments 
in  the  country;  relocation  of  some  companies  to  countries  where 
labor is cheaper; increased competition for the country; and other. 
The third option reflects perceived job insecurity. Even before the 

global crisis and the European debt crisis, when concerns about un-
employment were not exacerbated, about one-third to one-half of 
respondents see globalization as a relocation of companies abroad.
The survey also asked: “Which of the following two propositions is the 
one  which  is  closest  to  your  opinion  with  regard  to  globalization?” 
Possible answers included good opportunity for domestic companies; 
threat to employment and companies; and “do not know.” With the 
exception of Denmark, where only a small minority chose the second

option, between one-third and three-quarters of the respondents saw 
globalization as a threat to jobs.

Based on opinion polls, policies for jobs are often perceived as a 
zero-sum game in which gains for one country can be achieved only at 
the expense of others. The chairman and CEO (Chief Executive Officer) 
of Gallup put it as follows: “If you were to ask me, from all the world 
polling Gallup has done for more than 75 years, what would fix the 

world—what  would  suddenly  create  worldwide  peace,  global  well- 
being, and the next extraordinary advancements in human develop-
ment, I would say the immediate appearance of 1.8 billion jobs—for-
mal jobs.” In his view, “this raises an important distinction—not only do 
we need to create more jobs, we need to increase the number of good 
jobs. And we can’t see that quest for good jobs as an internal skirmish 
between warring political ideologies. It’s an international war.” a

Admittedly, 

the  dispersion  of  earnings 
within countries has also increased, for instance 
in the form of higher returns to education, and 
it is tempting to attribute this trend to global-
ization.  Low-skill  jobs  in  industrial  countries 
are often high-skill jobs from the perspective of 
developing  countries,  and  exporting  itself  is  a 
skill-intensive  activity.  Therefore,  international 
trade and offshore outsourcing can be expected 
to increase the relative demand for skills at both 
ends,  favoring  better-off  workers.  The  empiri-
cal  results  on  this  possible  effect  vary  widely, 
however.66  For  sure,  all  policies  create  winners 
and  losers,  and  the  distribution  of  labor  earn-
ings has widened in parallel with globalization, 
but a causal relationship is difficult to establish. 
Overall, widening disparities may have more to 
do with technological progress and financial lib-
eralization than with globalization. 

A  different  perspective  arises  when  consid-
ering  the  composition  of  employment,  rather 
than  the  level  or  dispersion  of  labor  earnings. 
Globalization  provides  developing  countries 
with the opportunity to connect to world mar-
kets and derive productivity spillovers boosting 
their economic growth. Manufacturing jobs in-
tegrated  in  global  value  chains,  as  well  as  jobs 
in  technologically  advanced  services  and  in  fi-
nance, are often seen as tickets to rapid devel-
opment. However, rapid technological progress 
and  economies  of  scale  may  mean  the  global 
number of some of these jobs will not increase 
much.  For  jobs  in  manufacturing,  the  experi-
ence of the last few decades has shown a relative 
stability of their global numbers together with a 
dramatic change in their spatial distribution. If 
so, policies for job creation could lead to a com-
petition not for the level of employment but for 
the jobs with the highest development payoffs.

The  experience  of  Japan  and  the  United 
States illustrates the point. In the 1950s, Japan 
exported  cheap  labor-intensive  products  in 
exchange  for  goods  embedded  with  more  ad-
vanced  knowledge  and  technology.  This  strat-
egy generated much needed revenue for Japan’s 
post–World War II recovery. More importantly, 
it  contributed  to  Japan’s  productivity  growth 
and  built  the  foundation  for  the  production 

of more sophisticated goods. In the 1970s and 
1980s,  Japan  not  only  began  exporting  steel, 
semiconductors,  and  automobiles  but  turned 
into a leading supplier. As the major exporter of 
these products, the United States suffered from 
Japan’s expansion.67 The United States had been 
characterized by its fluid labor markets. Yet, the 
potential welfare loss from the decline of Pitts-
burgh,  Detroit,  and  other  industrial  centers 
could  be  substantial,  even  if  labor  was  reallo-
cated smoothly.68 This competition was resolved 
by “voluntary export restraints”—a special form 
of quota that actually granted all quota rents to 
Japan but prevented a complete decline of such 
employment in the United States, indicating the 
importance attributed to these industries.69 

Concerns are similar for developing countries 
nowadays. Consider the opportunities opened by 
the increase in labor earnings in the coastal areas 
of  China.70  Some  labor-intensive  manufactur-
ing jobs connected with global value chains will  
migrate out of China in search of lower produc-
tion  costs.  Given  rapid  technological  progress,  
the global number of jobs in light manufactur- 
ing  is  unlikely  to  increase  much.  Low-income 
countries in both Sub-Saharan Africa and South 
Asia  aspire  to  attract  some  of  those  jobs,  so  a 
competition is involved. Tension is not limited 
to labor-intensive manufacturing jobs. A simi-
lar logic underlies government efforts to attract 
high-tech companies, as Costa Rica successfully 
did  with  Intel.71  This  is  also  the  logic  behind 
government  efforts  to  foster  services  exports, 
exemplified by the success of Brazil, Chile, India, 
Malaysia, and the Philippines.72

Because  technological  progress  and  global-
ization  connect  markets  to  an  unprecedented 
level, they also result in competition over other 
types  of  jobs  with  high  development  payoffs. 
Jobs located in a global hub can generate large 
productivity  spillovers.  London  stands  as  one 
of  the  most  economically  vibrant  cities  in  Eu-
rope largely because it serves as an international 
financial  center.  The  financial  industry  entails 
scale  economies  and  is  supported  by  density. 
Therefore, the number of global financial cen-
ters is limited, and their formation is shaped by 
location, history,  and national policies. Similar 
logic  applies  to  international  transportation 
hubs such as Singapore, clusters of information 

246

and  computer  technology–related  industries 
such as Silicon Valley and Bangalore, and so on. 

or an adverse effect on the social welfare of an-
other country.

Policies for jobs: Different degrees of 
competition

Even if globalization may result in a competition 
for  good  jobs  for  development,  not  all  efforts 
to support job creation amount to beggar-thy-
neighbor policies. Whether they do so depends 
on the type of instruments used and the nature 
of the spillovers from jobs.73

Because  globalization  involves  international 
trade and foreign direct investment, it is natural 
to  first  consider  trade-  and  investment-related 
instruments. Some of them, such as import tar-
iffs, export subsidies, and local content require-
ments, are ruled out by multilateral trade agree-
ments; others, such as improving access to credit 
for private exporters and identifying and remov-
ing  specific  constraints  faced  by  foreign  inves-
tors, are not. But in reality these are just a nar-
row subset of policies for jobs. When bidding to 
attract  foreign  direct  investment,  governments 
can  compete  directly  through  tax  holidays  or 
through  dedicated  physical  infrastructure  and 
human resources. They can also compete indi-
rectly, as when they take actions that appeal to 
both local entrepreneurs and foreign investors. 
For example, they can contain increases in the 
cost of labor by keeping mandated benefits af-
fordable.  Or  they  can  improve  the  availability 
and  quality  of  factors  of  production,  such  as 
worker skills and public infrastructure. In South 
Asia, for example, the quality of physical infra-
structure and the education of the workforce are 
the strongest predictors of entry of new firms.74
When considering good jobs for development 
more generally, and not just jobs connected to 
world markets, the set of policy options is even 
broader.  Urban  policies  are  another  important 
instrument to stimulate job creation by the pri-
vate  sector.  Given  the  potential  agglomeration 
of economies, relatively small interventions can 
have  large  effects.75  In  low-income  countries, 
enhancing  extension  services  may  have  a  large 
impact on farm productivity and, thus, on pov-
erty reduction. Whether this broader set of poli-
cies leads to a competition for jobs depends on 
whether policies in one country have a positive 

A key question to ask is what purpose poli-
cies  serve  (figure  7.3).  For  instance,  policies 
for  jobs  may  aim  to  improve  compliance  with 
rights,  prosecuting  forced  labor  and  harmful 
forms  of  child  labor.  Because  fundamental  la-
bor  rights  and  principles  have  been  endorsed 
by most countries, promoting compliance with 
rights  amounts  to  providing  a  global  public 
good.  Thus,  interventions  against  human  traf-
ficking or child prostitution in one country are 
unlikely  to  have  adverse  effects  in  other  coun-
tries and do not lead to a competition for jobs. 
In  the  absence  of  a  global  public  good  di-
mension,  the  second  question  is  what  market 
imperfection  or  institutional  failure  is  being 
addressed  by  the  policy  intervention.  Tackling 
the  institutional  failures  that  lead  to  conflict, 
discrimination, or lack of voice might have an 
effect on the international flows of goods, ser-
vices, and finance, but only indirectly. The risk 
that  government  interventions  in  these  areas 
will result in a competition for jobs with other 
countries is limited. The risk is also limited in 
the  case  of  interventions  aimed  at  providing 
jobs opportunities for the poor. In all of these 
cases, there should be gains in well-being in the 
developing country, and no substantial loss in 
well-being  in  other  countries.  Therefore,  jobs 
policies focused on strengthening social cohe-
sion and improving living standards should be 
acceptable as well.

The answer is less clear when government in-
terventions aim at enhancing productivity spill-
overs  from  jobs.  These  interventions  typically 
include  urban  development  policies,  invest-
ments  in  infrastructure  and  skills,  or  the  pro-
motion  of  entrepreneurship.  Because  these  in-
terventions are likely to affect the international 
flows of goods, services, and finance, the range 
of possible outcomes is broader. While no gen-
eral  rule  is  available,  interventions  that  under-
mine an open trading system most likely reduce 
aggregate well-being—probably more at home 
than abroad. On the other hand, interventions 
aligned  with  a  country’s  dynamic  comparative 
advantage could result in mutual gains. Admit-
tedly, assessing what “aligned” means in practice 
is bound to involve an element of judgment.76

But the East Asian experience, with jobs in man-
ufacturing migrating from Japan to Korea and 
Taiwan, China, and subsequently to China, and 
then to Vietnam, provides some hints. As these 

countries  followed  their  dynamic  compara-
tive advantage under the “flying geese” pattern 
of development, there were few instances of an 
open competition for jobs between them.

41.  Measuring the net effect of offshoring is complex, 
and different methodologies have been proposed. 
From a theoretical point of view, the net effect in 
a  given  country  is  ambiguous  because  offshor-
ing  may  reduce  employment  in  the  short  term, 
but the resulting specialization can induce pro-
ductivity gains that increase employment in the 
long term, although with a change in the share of 
different types of labor and occupations within 
the  total.  The  Organisation  for  Economic  Co- 
operation and Development (OECD 2007) and 
the  United  Nations  Conference  on  Trade  and 
Development  (UNCTAD  2004)  indicate  that 
offshoring  is  not  necessarily  a  zero-sum  game 
and that short-term job losses may be more than 
compensated  for  by  job  gains,  although  with 
variations across industries and sectors.

PART3

Policies through
the jobs lens

Introduction to Part 3

Most jobs are created by the private sec-

tor. While public works and targeted 
employment  programs  are  justified 
in certain situations, the primary role of govern-
ment is not to directly provide employment. It is 
to set the conditions for job creation by the pri-
vate sector, and especially to remove the obsta-
cles to the creation of more of the jobs with the 
highest development payoffs, given the circum-
stances of the country.

When  faced  with  jobs  challenges,  policy 
makers tend to look first at labor policies as ei-
ther the solution or the problem. It is important, 
then, to understand the role and the impacts of 
policies and institutions like labor market regu-
lation, collective bargaining, active labor market 
programs,  and  social  insurance.  But  the  main 
constraints to the job creation often lie outside 
the labor market, and a clear approach is needed 
to support appropriate policy responses.
•  Fundamentals are necessary for growth and 
are a precondition for strong job creation by 
the private sector. Macroeconomic sta bility, 
an  enabling  business  environment,  human 
capital,  and  the  rule  of  law,  including  the 
progressive realization of rights, are the key 
policy fundamentals.

•  Labor policies need to be adequate for growth 
to  translate  into  jobs.  Policies  should  seek  
to  avoid  the  distortive  interventions  that  
stifle labor reallocation and undermine the  
creation  of  jobs  in  functional  cities  and 
global value chains. But policies should also

ensure voice and social protection, especially 
for the most vulnerable. 

•  Policy priorities have to be established in sup-
port  of  good  jobs  for  development.  Ideally, 
policies should aim at removing the market 
imperfections and institutional failures pre-
venting the private sector from creating more 
of  those  jobs.  If  the  constraints  cannot  be 
easily singled out or are difficult to remove, 
offsetting policies may be considered.

Labor policies revisited

Labor policies can address labor market imperfections. But interventions 
can hinder dynamism in some cases, while the lack of mechanisms for 
voice and social protection affects the most vulnerable.

Labor  markets  have  imperfections  in  the 

form of inadequate information, uneven 
bargaining  power,  limited  ability  to  en-
force long-term commitments, and insufficient 
insurance  mechanisms  against  employment- 
related risks. Imperfections like these create gaps 
between  the  individual  and  the  social  value  of 
jobs. They can thus result in a level and compo-
sition of employment that are not optimal from 
a social point of view. 

Labor policies and institutions—regulations,  
collective  representation,  active  labor  market 
 programs, and unemployment insurance—can 
in principle be used to address these imperfec-
tions. Other policies, such as pensions and other 
forms of social insurance, address imperfections 
elsewhere in the economy but can have impor-
tant implications for the functioning of the labor 
market. 

Labor policies and institutions are bundled 
in  different  ways  in  different  countries  (fig-
ure 8.1).1 Their configuration tends to vary by 
level  of  development,  with  policies  and  insti-
tutions generally more developed in industrial 
countries. This is especially so for institutions 
providing a vehicle for collective voice, such as 
bargaining between employers and employees, 
and for social insurance. But the nature of the 
labor policies and institutions in any country is 
affected by more than just the level of develop-
ment  and  must  be  seen  in  the  context  of  the 

country’s  legal  traditions,  politics,  and  social 
norms and values.

The impact of labor policies is often the sub-
ject  of  heated  debates.  In  the  past  decade,  im-
proved data and methods have generated a great 
deal of new information not only in industrial 
countries but increasingly in developing coun-
tries as well. The analyses of these data have led 
to  fresh  insights.  Estimated  effects  prove  to  be 
relatively modest in most cases—certainly more 
modest than the intensity of the debate would 
suggest.  Excessive  or  insufficient  interventions 
can  certainly  have  detrimental  effects  on  pro-
ductivity.  But  in  between  these  extremes  lies  a 
“plateau”  where  effects  enhancing  and  under-
mining efficiency can be found side by side and 
most  of  the  impact  is  redistributive.  Overall, 
labor  policies  and  institutions  are  neither  the 
major obstacle nor the magic bullet for creating 
good jobs for development in most countries.

Labor regulations:  
A “plateau” effect

Labor  regulations  can  be  designed  to  address 
labor  market  failures  that  result  in  inefficient 
or inequitable outcomes. Difficulties in enforc-
ing  long-term  contracts  between  employers 
and employees may lead to excessive churning 
and underinvestment in training. Inefficiencies 
in  the  organization  of  insurance  schemes  may 
leave  workers  unprotected  in  the  case  of  dis-
missal, which could force them to curtail their 
job search before finding the right match. Un-
even market power can enable firms to set wages 
that are lower than would be agreed upon un-
der  more  competitive  conditions.  Discrimina-
tory practices can have the same effect. Uneven 
power  or  incomplete  information  may  lead  to 
an  unsafe  workplace.  These  market  imperfec-
tions  and  institutional  failures  can  affect  job 
creation and lead to gaps between what workers 
gain from employment and the social value of 
their jobs.

Employment protection legislation and 
minimum wages

Employment  protection  legislation  (EPL)  and 
minimum  wages  have  been  widely  adopted  to 
address some of these failures. EPL consists of 
rules governing hiring and termination and de-

fining the degree to which job security is guar-
anteed (box 8.1). Virtually all countries regulate 
hiring and termination in some way—severance 
payments, for example, are mandated by law or 
through collective agreements in 170 countries.2 
Similarly,  more  than  100  countries  have  rati-
fied  International  Labour  Organization  (ILO) 
conventions  regarding  minimum  wages,  and 
many others have established minimum wages 
even  though  they  have  not  ratified  these  con-
ventions.3 However, the specific nature of labor 
regulations  reflects  the  society  for  which  they 
are  written.  Important  determinants  include  a 
country’s legal tradition, as well as civic attitudes 
toward  solidarity,  inequality,  and  trust.4  The 
content, as well as the impact of regulations, is 
also  influenced  by  interactions  with  other  po-
tentially  complementary  institutions  such  as 
collective representation and social insurance. 

Views on labor regulations can be polarized, 
with  contrasting  implications  for  policy  mak-
ing.  Fundamental  questions,  such  as  whether 
labor  policies  should  protect  jobs  or  workers, 
often spark heated debates (question 8). 

For  some,  these  regulations  provide  neces-
sary  guarantees  for  workers  against  economic 
volatility  and  the  strong  bargaining  power  of 
firms.5 EPL can offer job security, deterring pre-
carious forms of employment. Minimum wages 
can  prevent  extreme  poverty  among  workers 
and  address  the  inefficiencies  that  stem  from 

BOX 8.1    Employment protection legislation covers more than firing rules

Employment  protection  legislation,  or  EPL,  can  be  classified  into 
two  main  groups  of  rules,  one  pertaining  to  hiring,  the  other  to 
 termination. Rules on hiring dictate what types of labor contracts 
are permissible under what conditions—for instance, open-ended, 
fixed-term, part-time, and apprenticeship contracts. Rules on ter-
mination govern the ending of contracts including causes (volun-
tary  and  involuntary,  justified  or  unfair),  end-of-service  compen-
sation  (severance  pay),  and  procedures  (for  instance,  third-party 
notification or approval, advance notice, and vesting periods). The 
mix and stringency of these rules result in a continuum of regula-
tion across countries, which has been subject to different measure-
ment efforts.a 

Other types of labor policies can also have implications for job 
security. Some regulations set specific conditions for the employ-
ment of women and young workers. They include maternity leave, 
the need for child care facilities, first-contract waivers, or reduced 
minimum wage for apprentices. The aim of these policies is to facili-
tate the  participation of more vulnerable population groups and to 
protect them once they are employed. Antidiscrimination regula-
tions  address  socially  unaccepted   differences  in  the  treatment  of 
workers,  with  the  goal  to  reduce  inequality  and  enhance  social 
cohesion and fairness in employment.

noncompetitive  labor  markets.6  By  establish-
ing a reference wage, minimum wages can even 
benefit uncovered workers through the so-called 
lighthouse effect.7 EPL and minimum wages are 
also seen as creating the conditions for human 
capital accumulation and associated productiv-
ity gains.8 

Critics  of  strong  EPL  and  minimum  wages 
hold  that  they  tend  to  reduce  employment, 
hinder  productivity  growth,  and  can  lead  to 
divisions in society between those who benefit 
from the regulations and those who do not. Ac-
cording to this view, to the extent that EPL and 
minimum wages raise labor costs, they can in-
crease poverty by pushing low-skilled workers, 
young people, and women into unemployment 
or into informal sector jobs.9 Hiring and termi-
nation restrictions can slow down labor reallo-
cation and hence constrain productivity growth. 
Finally, because they are often perceived as part 
of the social contract, labor market regulations 
can be difficult to reform, when circumstances 
change, generating discord and even conflict.10 

Modest impacts overall . . .

New  data  and  more  rigorous  methodologies 
have  spurred  a  wave  of  empirical  studies  over 
the past two decades on the effects of labor reg-
ulation.11  These  studies  examine  the  influence 
of  EPL  and  minimum  wages  on  employment, 
wages, the distribution of wages, and to a lesser 
extent,  productivity.  Few  have  looked  at  wider 
impacts on social cohesion.

Based  on  this  wave  of  new  research,  the 
overall impact of EPL and minimum wages is 
smaller than the intensity of the debate would 
suggest  (tables  8.1  and  8.2).12  Most  estimates 
of  the  impacts  on  employment  levels  tend  to 
be insignificant or modest.13 Studies of EPL in 
Latin America and the Caribbean, for example, 
report mixed results: negative employment ef-
fects  of  job  security  rules  have  been  found  in 
Argentina,  Colombia,  and  Peru,  while  no  sig-
nificant  effect  was  evident  in  Brazil  and  some 
Caribbean countries. Different studies for Chile 
have  reached  both  results.14  Overall,  the  ma-

jority of minimum wage studies do find nega-
tive  employment  effects,  especially  on  young 
workers. But magnitudes tend to be small and 
a number of studies report no effect, or in some 
cases, even positive effects.15 EPL and minimum 
wages can shift employment away from young 
people, women, and the less-skilled and toward 
prime-age men and the better educated.16 Their 
effects can vary within a country. In Indonesia, 
increasing  minimum  wages  during  the  1990s 
had  a  negative  effect  on  employment  among 
small  firms  but  not  on  large  firms.17  Across 
countries,  both  EPL  and  minimum  wages  are 
associated with a reduction in wage inequality.18 
EPL has clear dynamic effects, reducing labor 
market flows and increasing durations in both 
employment and unemployment.19 In this way, 
strong job security rules slow down labor real-
location and limit the efficiency gains from cre-
ative destruction. Studies on the overall impact 
of EPL on productivity are mixed, however, with 
some finding negative productivity impacts and 
others finding positive or no significant effects.20 
This mix of findings may be caused by other in-
fluences of job security rules, such as incentives 
to invest in training, which can counteract the 
lower  rates  of  labor  reallocation.  Some  coun-
tries have tried to reduce EPL by implementing 
partial (“dual-track”) reforms that increase the 
scope  for  nonpermanent  employment.  How-
ever,  unless  accompanied  by   reductions  in  the 
protection  of  permanent  jobs,  this  approach 
seems  to  result  in  the  more  vulnerable  groups 
ending up in more precarious employment.21

In  many  developing  countries  with  large 
informal sectors, the generally modest impacts 
of EPL and minimum wages may stem in part 
from poor coverage and weak enforcement. In 
Brazil,  employment  effects  of  strong  job  secu-
rity  provisions  were  negative  in  municipalities 
where  enforcement  was  strong.22  Mechanisms 
for  voice  and  representation  and  the  capacity 
of  government  to  effectively  administer  regu-
lations  influence  the  effectiveness  of  enforce-
ment. Certainly, poor rules coupled with weak 
enforcement are not a desirable combination to 
address labor market imperfections.

But  many  countries  appear  to  set  EPL  and 
minimum  wages  in  a  range  where  impacts  on 
employment or productivity are modest. Within 
that  range,  or “plateau,”  effects  enhancing  and 
undermining  efficiency  can  be  found  side  by 
side,  and  most  of  the  impact  is  redistributive. 
The distributional effects tend to be equalizing 
among those who are covered by these regula-
tions, but divisions can be accentuated between 
those covered and those who are not. With ef-
ficiency effects relatively modest on the plateau, 
countries  can  choose  where  they  want  to  be 
depending  on  their  normative  preferences  for 
redistribution.

. . . but cliffs at the edge of the plateau

However,  when  the  edge  of  the  plateau  is 
reached  (either  on  the  too-strict  or  too-loose 
side), impacts are more negative. Some studies 
have found that Indian states with more restric-

 

Labor policies revisited   

263

tive  EPL  have  significantly  lower  employment 
and  output,  and  this  effect  is  strongest  where 
dispute resolution is ineffective or costly.23 Large 
increases  in  the  minimum  wage  in  Colombia 
in the late 1990s led to significant employment 
losses, exacerbated by weak labor demand at the 
time.24  At  this  edge  of  the  plateau,  which  can 
vary  according  to  the  country  situation,  labor 
regulations can slow down job creation in cities, 
or in global value chains, and can cause coun-
tries to miss out on jobs supporting agglomera-
tion effects and knowledge spillovers. Forgoing 
the development payoffs from urbanization and 
global integration would be one way to fall off 
the cliff. 

It does not follow that minimal regulation is 
the answer. If rules are too weak, or not enforced, 
the problems of poor information, unequal bar-
gaining power, or inadequate risk management 
remain unaddressed. This cliff may be less vis-
ible than excessive labor market rigidity, but it 
is no less real.

The main challenge is to set EPL and mini-
mum wages so that they address the imperfec-
tions in the labor market without falling off the 
plateau.  The  edges  of  the  plateau  vary  across 
countries and even within countries over time, 
as  conditions  change.  In  Brazil,  for  example, 
minimum wages had negative impacts on em-
ployment  in  the  1990s  but  not  over  the  past 
decade, even though they were increasing rela-
tive to average wages.25 It is important, then, to 
monitor impacts closely and reflect on the de-
sign  and  implementation  of  regulations  and 
their  interaction  with  other  institutions.26  Al-
though EPL and minimum wages may not ad-
dress labor market imperfections effectively, in 
most countries good jobs for development are 
lacking for other reasons. 

Collective representation:  
New forms of voice

Collective bargaining and other forms of “voice” 
can  address  information  failures  at  the  work-
place in ways that enhance productivity as well 
as  employment  security  and  earnings.  For  in-
stance, workers may have knowledge about the 
details of production and operations that those 
making  decisions  do  not  have.  Employers  are 
likely  to  be  informed  about  certain  aspects  of 

the business that would be relevant and useful 
for  workers.  Information  sharing  can  gener-
ate  additional  efficiency  gains  by  providing  a 
mechanism for resolving conflicts and reducing 
wasteful turnover.

Collective representation and bargaining can 
also address problems of uneven market power 
whereby  firms  may  be  able  to  impose  lower 
wages  or  inferior  working  conditions  on  indi-
vidual  workers  than  would  be  the  case  under 
competitive conditions. 

Bargaining between firms and workers

The coverage of unions and collective bargain-
ing  varies  considerably  around  the  world  (fig-
ure  8.2).  Coverage  rates  are  generally  low  in 
developing countries, where few workers out of 
the  civil  service  or  protected  sectors  belong  to 
a trade union. In most countries where regular 
data are available, the coverage of collective bar-
gaining agreements has declined during the past 
two decades.27 The shift of employment toward 
the  services  sector,  globalization,  technological 
progress,  evolving  social  values,  and  legislative 
changes have all been advanced as causes of this 
decline.28 

The  vast  majority  of  the  evidence  confirms 
the  existence  of  a  wage  premium  in  favor  of 
union members and other workers covered by 
collective agreements. Estimates of the adjusted 
union wage effect (controlling for other factors) 
range from around 5 percent in Japan and the 
Republic of Korea, up to 15 percent in countries 
as varied as Brazil, Canada, Germany, Malaysia, 
Mexico,  and  the  United  States.29  South  Africa 
stands at the upper end, although there is con-
troversy on how high the union wage effect ac-
tually is (box 8.2). Wage effects tend to be stron-
gest  for  women  and  in  countries  where  union 
membership is high. It is also clear that unions 
and collective bargaining have an equalizing ef-
fect  on  earnings  distributions  by  compressing 
wage differentials. Research has shown that wage 
inequality falls during periods when union den-
sity is increasing and rises when union member-
ship is in decline.30 Little evidence exists on the 
impact of unions on poverty.

One relevant question is whether union wage 
gains come at the expense of reduced employ-
ment. Unfortunately, few studies have addressed 
this  question  in  developing  countries.  In  in-

Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD)  find 
that a 10 percentage point decline in union cov-
erage is associated with an increase in employ-
ment of 0.8 percentage points.31

Industrial relations and productivity

The  impact  of  collective  bargaining  on  pro-
ductivity  reflects  the  balance  of  two  opposing 
forces. On the one hand, voice may lead to bet-
ter information sharing, while higher labor costs  
under  unionization  may  encourage  manage-
ment  to  invest  more  on  training  and  technol-
ogy, leading to higher productivity. On the other 
hand, unions may also be able to negotiate re-
strictions  in  hours  worked  and  pay  rules  that 
reduce  effort,  hindering  productivity.  The  net 
effect of these forces is then an empirical mat-

ter.  The  evidence  collected  on  productivity  in 
the United States and Europe is not conclusive.32 
In  developing  countries,  effects  are  positive  in 
Malaysia, Mexico, and Uruguay, but negative in 
Brazil.33  Findings  suggest  that  unionized  firms 
undertake  more  training  than  nonunionized 
firms. But differences in the introduction of new 
technologies are not significant.

The institutional structure for collective bar-
gaining can differ considerably across countries, 
especially in the degree of centralization and co-
ordination. Arrangements vary from firm-level 
bargaining with no influence on other firms to 
industry-based  bargaining  to  centralized  bar-
gaining  with  national  coverage.  Prior  to  the 
1990s,  researchers  found  that  both  centralized 
and decentralized bargaining led to better em-
ployment  performance.  Analysis  has  been  less 
conclusive since then, however.34 

With policy changes, some developing coun-
tries  and  emerging  economies  have  extended 
worker representation and are seeing new forms 
of collective bargaining. In China, for example, 
a number of legislative reforms appear to have

BOX 8.2    Are bargaining councils the cause of unemployment in South Africa?

With unemployment rates well above 20 percent, the South African 
labor market is very different from that of other developing coun-
tries, usually characterized by low or moderate levels of open unem-
ployment.  Diverse  explanations  have  been  put  forward,  including 
growth  concentrated  in  low-labor-intensity  sectors,  skills  deficits, 
work disincentives created by social benefits, and various legacies of 
apartheid. South Africa’s distinct collective bargaining arrangements 
are also frequently mentioned as a possible explanation for the lack 
of jobs. 

Since the 1920s, bargaining over wages and working conditions 
in  most  of  South  Africa’s  manufacturing  sector  has  taken  place 
through  industrial  councils,  now  known  as  bargaining  councils. 
 Bargaining  councils  can  request  that  agreements  be  extended  to 
their entire sector, including to employers and workers who did not 
participate  in  the  negotiations.  Extensions  are  common  but  vary 
considerably  across  sectors  and  areas.  Firm-level  bargaining  also 
occurs. It has been argued that sectorwide extensions of bargaining 
council  agreements  impose  a  heavy  labor  cost  burden  on  small 
firms, undermining employment creation.a 

Estimates  of  wage  premiums  as  high  as  60  percent  for  union 
members appeared to provide some credence to this argument.b A 
substantial part of this wage effect was associated with industries 
that could possibly reflect the influence of the councils. Subsequent 
research using more recent data and better methodologies has con-
cluded that early studies overestimated the real wage effect of the 
bargaining  council  agreements.  The  latest  research  suggests  the 
wage premium is in the 10–20 percent range.c This level is signifi-

cant  but  more  in  line  with  union  wage   differentials  observed  in 
other  countries.  Evidence  also  suggests  that  bargaining  council 
extensions do have effects as well, adding around 10 percent to the 
wages of nonunion workers within the bargaining council system.d 
These results imply that the South Africa’s wage-setting institu-
tions  do  have  some  employment  effects,  especially  among  small 
firms, whose contribution to total job creation is small by interna-
tional standards. Bargaining councils are estimated to be associated 
with 8–13 percent lower employment in the firms they cover directly 
and with 7–16 percent lower employment in small firms.e 

While  these  effects  are  not  trivial,  bargaining  councils  can 
explain only a small part of South Africa’s unusually high unemploy-
ment  rates.  Given  the  number  of  workers  employed  in  industries 
covered  by  collective  agreements,  eliminating  the  employment 
effect of bargaining councils would reduce the unemployment rate 
by 1.5 percentage points, at the most.f So the main constraints to 
job creation may lie elsewhere.

One clue is the relatively small size of the informal sector com-
pared to other countries at a similar development level. South Africa 
is  different  from  these  countries  in  other  ways,  too.  During  the 
apartheid period, slum clearance, harsh licensing, and strict zoning 
regulations  rid  cities  of  black-dominated  informal  sector  niches. 
Two decades after the end of apartheid, spatial segregation remains, 
and investment in black-dominated areas is low.g The legacy of sep-
aration also results in high transportation costs for the unemployed, 
who tend to live far from where the jobs are. So South Africa’s job 
creation problems may stem primarily from urban issues.

opened  the  door  to  a  proliferation  of  unions 
and collective bargaining agreements (box 8.3). 

Voice beyond the firm

Employers’ organizations and unions also play 
roles as social and political agents. They may in-
fluence the laws that regulate labor markets and 
even  policies  beyond  the  sphere  of  labor  rela-
tions. The nature of such involvement depends 
on  the  norms  and  institutional  framework  in 
the  society  in  which  they  operate.  Historically, 
labor unions have contributed to the establish-
ment of social and labor rights, as well as to po-
litical change, in many countries. For instance, 

Solidarność,  a  Polish  trade  union  federation, 
was prominent in the fight against Communist 
rule, while the Confederation of South African 
Trade Unions played a leading role in the fight 
against apartheid.

In  some  countries,  especially  developing 
countries,  the  political  involvement  of  unions 
can  overshadow  their  activities  at  the  work-
place.35 Because their membership is strong in 
the civil service and in protected sectors, unions 
have  often  opposed  reforms  involving  fiscal 
consolidation, privatization, or liberalization. A 
comparison of economic performances in times 
of reform shows that developing countries with 
higher union membership and higher shares of

BOX 8.3    New forms of collective bargaining are emerging in China

Since  the  turn  of  the  century,  China  has  undergone  important 
changes in labor policies, including enactment of new laws regard-
ing trade unions (in 2001) and employment promotion, labor con-
tracts, and labor dispute mediation and arbitration (in 2007). These 
changes have been accompanied by rapid growth in the number of 
unionized  workers  and  workers  covered  by  wage  or  collective 
agreements (more than 150 million at present). In addition to the 
spread of unionization and  collective agreements, the International 
Labour Organization (ILO) has documented the gradual spread in 
the  direct  election  of  union  representatives  by  workers.  Such 
changes reflect a policy shift that “is intended to bring better pro-
tection of workers’ rights, to create a new balance between flexibil-
ity and security and to facilitate a dialogue between employers and 
workers on issues of mutual concern.”a

Another  notable  change  over  the  past  decade  has  been  the 
introduction  of  local,  sectoral-based  collective  bargaining  agree-
ments. The first of these agreements was negotiated in 2003 in the 
wool-sweater manufacturing industry in the Xinhe district of Wen-
ling in Zhejiang province.b This is a district known as an example of 
transparency  and  local  democracy.  Since  then,  these  agreements 
have  been  most  prominent  in  Zhejiang,  but  have  also  spread  to 
some  other  coastal  provinces.c  For  the  most  part,  local,  sectoral-

based  bargaining  has  emerged  where  industries  cluster  around  a 
district or village. By the end of 2010, this form of bargaining cov-
ered over 5 million workers through 73,000 agreements.d 

The spread of local, sectoral collective bargaining agreements 
has  occurred  against  the  backdrop  of  a  vibrant  private  sector 
increasingly facing labor shortages and an inadequately regulated 
labor  market  that  has  led  to  many  disruptive  labor  disputes.  In 
some  cases,  these  agreements  appear  to  protect  workers’  rights 
more effectively.e At the same time, the private sector can also ben-
efit from a more stable relationship with workers, a more reliable 
supply of labor, and more regular and transparent changes in labor 
costs. 

The forms of collective representation in China are diversifying, 
with government encouragement. Although evidence is only grad-
ually  emerging  about  the  consequences  of  these  changes,  some 
research  suggests  that  sectoral  bargaining  at  the  district  or  local 
level holds the most promise.f Centralized “top-down” efforts have 
been made to spur the proliferation of these agreements, with lim-
ited success. But the spontaneous spread of this spatial organization 
of collective bargaining suggests that it matches well the interest of 
the private sector in coordinating the operation of industrial clus-
ters with the interest of workers to have voice in the workplace.

employment  in  the  public  sector  (where  most 
unionized workers are) experienced deeper de-
clines in economic activity before the adoption 
of  major  reforms  and  slower  recoveries  after-
ward.36  This  finding  is  consistent  with  the  re-
forms being adopted late, and their implemen-
tation being watered-down. On the other hand, 
the level of minimum wages and social security 
benefits did not affect performance, suggesting 
that trade unions made a difference because of 
their  political  activities,  more  than  because  of 
their impact on labor costs. 

Trade unions organized around the employer- 
employee relationship are less suited to provid-
ing voice to those who do not work for a wage. 
The high incidence of self-employment in most 
developing countries, and the persistence of in-
formality more generally, have created impetus 
for  innovative  institutions  for  collective  repre-
sentation. These institutions are different from 
traditional unions because the market imperfec-

tions and institutional failures they address do 
not  involve  conventional  employer-employee 
relationships  or  workplace-based  production 
structures. They are often organized to represent 
members’ interests with a particular municipal 
authority or local government. 

Associations  of  self-employed  workers  are 
emerging  as  a  vehicle  to  demand  and  protect 
their members’ rights and improve their work-
ing conditions. Some of them have drawn their 
inspiration  from  India’s  Self  Employed  Wom-
en’s Association (SEWA), which was created 40 
years ago. In many cases, groups such as street 
vendors in Lima, Peru, or garbage collectors in 
Pune, India, may not only negotiate with gov-
ernment authorities but also resort to litigation 
in the courts. Waste pickers in Bogotá, Colom-
bia, organized to defend their right to provide 
services to municipalities (box 8.4). Street ven-
dors associations in Durban, South Africa, filed 
cases in court against the construction of malls

BOX 8.4    Recicladores forced changes in Bogotá’s solid waste management policies

Waste  pickers,  or  recicladores,  in  Colombia’s  capital  earn  a  living 
by  recycling  metals,  cardboard,  paper,  plastic,  and  glass  and  sell- 
ing  them  through  intermediaries.  Efficiency  considerations  aside, 
their  experience  shows  how  associations  of  informal  workers  can 
use legal frameworks to access rights. 

When  reforms  for  the  tendering  of  public  services  allowed 
municipal governments to give exclusive contracts to private com-
panies for collecting, transporting, and disposing waste and recy-
clables, the recicladores organized and filed legal claims. Organiza-
tions  such  as  the  Asociación  de  Recicladores  de  Bogotá  (ARB),  an 
umbrella  association  of  groups  representing  more  than  25,000 
waste pickers, played a key role in aggregating claims and taking 
cases forward. In making its case, the ARB appealed to the constitu-
tion’s provision of the “right to equality,” arguing that waste pickers 

need  preferential  treatment  and  judicial  affirmative  action  in  the 
tendering and bidding process for government contracts to man-
age waste.

In 2003, the Constitutional Court ruled that the municipal gov-
ernment’s tendering process for sanitation services had violated the 
basic  rights  of  waste  pickers.  Subsequent  cases  have  referred  to 
constitutional  provisions  including  the  “right  to  survival”  as  an 
expression  of  the  “right  to  life.”  Article  11  of  the  constitution  was 
invoked to argue the right to pursue waste picking as a livelihood 
and the “right to pursue business and trade.” Article 333 was invoked 
to argue that cooperatives of waste pickers, not just corporations, 
can compete in waste recycling markets. The most recent case in 
December 2011 halted a US$1.37 billion contract for the collection 
and removal of waste in the city.

and against harassment and confiscation of their 
inventories of goods by municipal authorities.37 
These  nontraditional  workers’  organizations 
are  increasingly  participating  in  global  institu-
tions such as the ILO. For instance, the Interna-
tional Domestic Workers Network attended the 
International Labour Conference in 2009 in or-
der to prepare for discussion and vote on a new 
ILO convention on domestic work at the Inter-
national Labour Conferences in 2010 and 2011.38

Active labor market programs: 
Effective within limits

Active  labor  market  programs  (ALMPs)  can 
improve  the  efficiency  of  job  matching  by 
transmitting  information  on  job  openings 
and  worker  characteristics  between  employ-
ers and jobseekers. They can fill the gap when 
employers  or  workers  underinvest  in  training 
because  of  various  market  failures,  and  they 
can  mitigate  the  impacts  of  economic  down-
turns  by  providing  workers  with  temporary 
employment or creating incentives for employ-
ers to hire. ALMPs are politically attractive for 
governments eager to do something about job 
creation.

The  most  common  active  labor  market 
 programs  are  job  search  assistance,  wage  sub-
sidies,  training,  and  public  works.39  In  terms 
of  size,  interventions  range  from  huge  public 

works  programs  such  as  the  Mahatma  Gan-
dhi  National  Rural  Employment  Guarantee 
Act (MGNREGA), offering work to millions in 
rural India, to tailor-made life-skill courses for 
small groups of young participants in the Do-
minican  Republic.  All  ALMPs  strive  to  foster 
new job opportunities, often for those with the 
fewest chances in the labor market. 

A panorama of programs

Job search assistance. These are services provid-
ing information on job vacancies and jobseekers 
and offering counseling and placement support. 
Evaluations  indicate  that  job  search  assistance 
can improve employment and earnings at a low 
cost—but only when job vacancies exist. By pro-
viding information and making the labor mar-
ket more meritocratic, more effective matching 
can  have  positive  productivity  effects.  But  job 
search  assistance  is  less  relevant  in  countries 
where a majority of the workers are farmers and 
self-employed.

In  many  high-income  and  some  middle- 
income countries with largely formal labor mar-
kets, job search services have been overhauled in 
the past 10 years. Although public financing re-
mains the norm, private provision of services has 
become more common. Performance contracts 
are  being  used  to  create  incentives  for  provid-
ers. These contracts must ensure that providers 
reach  those  in  most  need  and  do  not  concen-

268 

  WO R L D   D E V E LO P M E N T   R E P O RT   2 0 1 3

trate only on those who are easy to place.40 Job 
search  support  is  increasingly  being  integrated 
with  a  range  of  complementary  services  such 
as profiling to assess opportunities, life skills, or 
other  training. “Activation”  strategies  requiring 
job seekers to be brisk, are also becoming more 
common.  Ultimately,  the  success  of  job  search 
services depends on the capacity of providers to 
reach out to employers’ needs.41 

Potentially game-changing technological in-
novations  are  now  extending  the  reach  of  tra-
ditional  intermediation.42  Mobile  phones  and 
the  Internet  have  opened  up  possibilities  for 
inclusive  information  access,  connecting  un-
registered firms and hard-to-reach youth. New 
actors, including both businesses and nonprofit 
organizations, have emerged and run services in 
various country settings (box 8.5). 

Wage  subsidies.  These  are  direct  transfers  to 
employers  or  reductions  in  their  taxes  or  so-
cial  contributions  to  encourage  them  to  hire 
new workers or to keep employees who might 
otherwise be laid off. Wage subsidies work best 
when  they  are  targeted  to  particular  groups, 
such as young people who need an opportunity 

to  demonstrate  their  skills,  or  the  long-term 
unemployed who are at risk of suffering “scar-
ring” effects.43 But many studies show that they 
often do not have their intended effect of creat-
ing new jobs in a cost-effective fashion.44

The real costs of wage subsidies are often hard 
to  calculate;  the  direct  toll  on  the  public  purse 
is only part of the story. To access the subsidies, 
firms  might  replace  ineligible  workers  with 
eligible ones or dismiss and then hire the same 
worker  under  the  subsidy  program.  If  firms 
would  have  hired  anyway,  the  employment  ef-
fect of a subsidy is zero. Design can help increase 
cost-effectiveness.  Improvements  in  the  target-
ing and other features of a subsidy program in 
Turkey reduced this “deadweight loss,” although 
somewhere  between  25  and  50  percent  of  all 
subsidized  jobs  would  have  still  been  created 
without  the  subsidy.45  Proper  cost  accounting 
can reduce the estimated employment impact of 
wage subsidies by up to 90 percent.46 Aggregate 
employment effects are hence low at best. Alter-
native designs, especially to reach the young and 
low-skilled,  can  include  a  wage  subsidy  linked 
to  other  active  labor  market  programs  such  as 
training.47 The Jóvenes programs and similar in-

BOX 8.5    E-links to jobs: New technologies open new frontiers

New  technologies  are  revolutionizing  how  people  connect  with 
jobs.  Mobile  phones  have  spread  widely  and  have  penetrated  
low-income  households  around  the  world.  Over  4  billion  people 
have cell phone access, and 1.5 billion have regular access to the 
Internet.

Text messaging, voice, and mobile applications give jobseekers 
and employers access to information and job counseling  services 
that improve résumés and interview skills and establish networks. 
Voice-based  services  are  particularly  important  for  illiterate  job-
seekers.  Companies  or  nonprofit  organizations  such  as  Souktel, 
Assured  Labor,  Babajob,  and  Labournet,  operating  in  places  as 
diverse  as  Latin  America,  India,  and  the  Middle  East,  have  estab-
lished  thriving  job  matching  networks.  Souktel,  for  example,  has 
17,000 jobseekers and 600 companies registered in West Bank and 
Gaza  alone.  Sixty  percent  of  registered  employers  reported  they 
had cut recruiting time and costs by more than 50 percent. 

Some organizations, such as Assured Labor, specifically focus on 
services  for  middle-  to  low-wage  workers,  most  without  college 
degrees. Currently, Assured Labor has 150,000 registered jobseekers 
and 2,000 employers in Mexico. Similarly, Babajob and Labournet in 
India  serve  200,000  and  100,000  jobseekers  who  can  search  for 
em ployment in databases containing 40,000 and 45,000 employers, 
respectively. Labournet is unique in that it serves the informal labor 

market,  focusing  on  sectors  such  as  construction  and  facility 
management. 

While these companies and organizations have been successful, 
others such as Konbit in Haiti and PULS in Pakistan had to overcome 
significant difficulties. Challenges have included attracting sufficient 
numbers of jobseekers and employers, building trust among users, 
and  ensuring  adequate  assurance  on  the  quality  of  jobseekers.  In 
response, Konbit has tried to increase the number of users by part-
nering with a locally famous radio disk jockey and mobile phone pro-
vider  to  advertise  its  service.  Through  these  efforts,  the  company 
was successful in attracting 10,000 jobseekers in one month.

The  Internet  also  brings  together  jobseekers  and  employers 
through  online  platforms.  The  large  and  fast  growing  oDesk  con-
nects  about  350,000  companies  (mainly  small  and  medium  enter-
prises)  with  individual  contractors  worldwide.  From  April  to  June 
2012,  oDesk  posted  online  close  to  450,000  jobs  and  more  than 
280,000 job applications. Jobs range from typing, web research, and 
translation to software development and back-office legal services. 
Wages range from US$1 to several hundred US$ per hour. While this 
new phenomenon has the potential to create many new jobs and 
generate substantial new wealth, online platforms generally serve 
people with specialized and technical skills, and as such, reach few of 
the most vulnerable.

terventions in several Latin American countries 
have employed this model with positive results.48
The  impact  of  wage  subsidies  tends  to  rise 
with tight targeting and the extent of the disad-
vantage  of  the  beneficiary  group.  In  Morocco, 
the Idmaj youth wage subsidy effectively eased 
labor  market  entry  for  beneficiaries.49  Argen-
tina provided wage subsidies to employers hir-
ing  former  participants  in  large  public  works 
programs.  These  workers  exerted  more  effort 
in  searching  for  jobs  and  were  perceived  as 
more  trustworthy  than  other  similar  workers. 
That was true especially for women and young 
participants.50  But  the  narrower  the  focus,  the 
higher  the  potential  stigma  effects.  In  Poland, 
men eligible for the wage subsidies were actually 
less likely to be employed.51 

Training  for  jobseekers.  Training  is  the  most 
widely used active labor market program. The 
growing body of impact evaluations underlines 
the importance of aligning the skills taught with 
labor  demand.  These  evaluations  show  that 
positive  benefits  are  not  guaranteed  and  pro-
gram costs can be substantial. When programs 
are well conceived and implemented, however, 
they  can  benefit  those  furthest  from  jobs  the 
most. In Latin American countries, and in tran-
sition economies such as Romania, youth and 
women record significantly higher success rates 
from training than do middle-aged men.52

Some  design  features  are  critical  for  suc-
cess. Integrated programs that include both on- 
the-job  and  classroom  components  pay  off.  
Especially  in  developed  and  Latin  American 
countries,  training  for  job  seekers  now  often 
follows  this  integrated  model,  sometimes  with 
complementary services such as life skills train-
ing and counseling. Such combinations increase 
success  rates  (figure  8.3).53  The  Jóvenes  pro-
grams  in  Latin  America,  which  combine  life- 
skills  and  technical  training  with  work  experi-
ence, are a case in point. In Colombia, Jóvenes 
en Acción has increased employability of train-
ees, with an estimated rate of return of 13.5–25 
percent for female participants.54

In addition, providers need incentives to en-
sure  that  the  training  they  offer  is  relevant  for 
the needs of employers. Public training agencies 
often respond too slowly to changing demands 
from firms and jobseekers alike. Where a coun-
try’s institutional capacity and supply of training

organizations  allows,  public  training  funds  can 
be directed to private and nonprofit providers in 
competitive  terms.  Performance-based  tender-
ing can create incentives for more relevant train-
ing,  while  contracting  can  be  designed  so  that 
the toughest-to-reach groups do not lose out. In 
Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Serbia, and Slove-
nia, public employment services purchase train-
ing  programs  from  various  providers  through 
public tenders.

Research  shows  that  at  least  some  training 
programs  help  build  trust  and  civic  engage-
ment, but information about how that happens 
is  scant.  In  Tunisia,  the  inclusion  of  entrepre-
neurship training in education curricula reform 
improved  participants’  optimism  about  the 
future.55  In  the  Dominican  Republic,  partici-
pants in the Juventud y Empleo program were 
more likely to have higher expectations for the 
future, higher job satisfaction, and more inten-
sive search attitudes.56 In northern Uganda, par-
ticipation in a comprehensive intervention that 
combined grants, vocational training, life skills, 
and  psychosocial  counseling  was  successful  in 
increasing community participation.57

Public  works.  These  programs  offer  short-term 
employment  for  wages  or  food.  The  evidence 

270 

  WO R L D   D E V E LO P M E N T   R E P O RT   2 0 1 3

from  impact  evaluations  shows  that  public 
works  programs  can  be  useful  as  a  safety  net, 
especially  when  targeted  toward  those  in  the 
greatest need.58 Careful setting of the wage level 
can be a self-targeting tool as has been done in 
Colombia’s  Empleo  en  Acción  and  Argentina’s 
Trabajar programs. A similar targeting approach 
is  being  used  in  India’s  MGNREGA  program, 
which is notable not only for its scale and cost 
but also for its rights-based approach in guaran-
teeing employment (box 8.6). 

But seldom are public works a springboard 
for better jobs in the future. There is little evi-
dence that they help participants get a job after 
they leave the program.59 Compared with other 
ALMPs, public works programs have the lowest 
placement rates after completion and the high-
est  costs  per  placement  (figure  8.4).  In  Poland 
and Romania, public works have even adversely 
affected employability.60 Their productivity im-
pact, hence, tends to be very low at best.

To become a jobs ladder, public works pro-
grams  need  to  go  beyond  poverty  relief—a 
route  some  countries  already  are  taking.  In  El 
Salvador  and  Papua  New  Guinea,  participants 
in  public  works  programs  obtain  additional 
technical and life-skills support. In Sierra Leone, 
the  package  comes  with  compulsory  literacy 
and numeracy training, and in Liberia with life-
skills  training.  In  Bangladesh,  the  beneficiaries 
of a rural employment scheme were referred to 
microfinance  institutions;  three  years  after  the 
program  closed,  almost  80  percent  were  still 
self-employed  in  microenterprise  activities.61 
But  overall,  very  few  public  works  programs 
succeed in improving the long-run employabil-
ity of participants. 

Public works have the potential to contribute 
to social cohesion though, especially in conflict-
affected countries. Soon after the conflict ended 
in Sierra Leone, a workfare program was launched 
to help rebuild infrastructure and provide short-
term employment opportunities to the poor and 
ex-combatants. Public works programs have also 
been launched and scaled up in Guinea, Guinea- 
Bissau,  Liberia,  and  the  Republic  of  Yemen.  
In Serbia, participants felt socially more included 
as a result of a public works program.62

Striving to deliver better outcomes

While  many  programs  have  met  expectations 
in countries with very different job challenges, 

many  others  have  not  succeeded  in  improv-
ing outcomes for participants. Moreover, while 
some programs are affordable, others are expen-
sive. Outcomes for ALMPs depend on their de-
sign but also on the institutional capacity of the 
country to provide services on a national scale 
and on a continuous basis. 

Program  and  policy  design  has  been  re-
vamped  in  many  countries  in  recent  years  to 
achieve  better  performance.  Public  funds  in-
creasingly  finance  private  or  nonprofit  provi-
sion. In aging and formalizing countries, a forth-
coming  attitude  by  jobseekers  is  increasingly 
required for them to remain eligible for unem-
ployment and other social benefits. Such activa-
tion  measures  create  incentives  for  job  search 
through  participation  in  training  or  education 
courses, counseling and other employment ser-
vices, or public works. 

Many  industrial  countries  are  implement-
ing such policies through “one-stop shops” for 
the  administration  of  both  social  benefits  and 
ALMPs.  Germany’s  Jobcenter  and  the  United 
Kingdom’s  JobCentre  Plus  are  examples.  This 
integrated approach can in principle help work-
ers maintain or create links in society, albeit evi-
dence here is scant.63 The one-stop-shop model 
is gaining momentum in a number of develop-
ing countries as varied as Argentina, Azerbaijan, 
and Bulgaria.

Another  important  delivery  reform  is  the 
growing investment in identifying the employ-
ment constraints faced by jobseekers. Obstacles 
to finding jobs may range from inadequate skills 
to  health  issues to  difficulties  balancing  family 
responsibilities  with  work.  Statistical  profiling, 
where individual characteristics of beneficiaries 
are linked with likely constraints and appropri-
ate  remedies,  has  become  an  important  tool, 
especially  in  countries  with  significant  institu-
tional capacity.64 Comprehensive programs like 
Chile  Solidario  invest  heavily  in  linking  ben-
eficiaries to the most appropriate programs de-
pending on their constraints.

In  sum, ALMPs  can  make  a  difference,  but 
they need to be well aligned to the needs of the 
labor market and designed to address the mar-
ket imperfections and institutional failures that 
hinder desired employment outcomes. Overall, 
evaluations  of  programs  with  youth  partici-
pants show that developing countries have bet-
ter results than industrial countries in fostering 
employability. 65 The time horizon also matters:

BOX 8.6    The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act launched the biggest public 

works program in the world

Public works programs have been actively used in India since the 
1950s.  Yet  no  scheme  has  had  a  scope  or  budget  on  the  scale  of  
the  Mahatma  Gandhi  National  Rural  Employment  Guarantee  Act  
(MGNREGA).  Launched  in  2006  and  implemented  in  three  rollout 
phases, this program guarantees jobs to all districts with rural popu-
lations. The program aims to provide wage employment, improve 
the purchasing power of the rural poor, create assets for the com-
munity, strengthen natural resource management, and foster social 
and gender equality.a 

The program guarantees up to 100 days of employment a year to 
rural households with adult members willing to do unskilled work at 
a  wage  that  is  roughly  the  state  statutory  minimum  wage.b Rural 
households wanting to participate in the program are required to 
register with their respective village council (gram  panchayats) and 
are issued a free job card with photographs of all members living in 
it. A job card holder may apply for employment and the government 
must provide it within 15 days. If the government fails to do so, in 
principle  a  daily  unemployment  allowance  must  be  given  to  the 
applicant. Each household decides how to distribute employment 
among its members. Daily wages are based on the amount of work 
done  and  are  paid  directly  into  post  office  or  bank  accounts.  The 
program  includes  some  provision  for  adequate  worksite  facilities, 
including access to safe drinking water, shade, a first aid kit in case of 
accident, and crèches for women to leave their children. The pro-
gram encourages the participation of women through a mandate 
that  they  should  account  for  33  percent  of  employed  workers.  In 
addition, wages have to be equal for men and women, work has to 
be  provided  within  five  kilometers  of  the  applicant’s  village,  and 
gender discrimination of any type is forbidden.c 

Most of the public works carried out under MGNREGA are labor 
intensive; contractors and machines are not allowed on work sites. 
Projects are meant to be chosen in open village meetings (gram sab-
has) to reflect village priorities, and local councils play a substantive 
role in planning, implementing, and monitoring them. The projects 
mainly  focus  on  developing  and  maintaining  community  assets 
such as water conservation and water harvesting, irrigation chan-
nels,  and  rural  roads.  Drought  proofing,  flood  control,  and  land 
development are also supported by the program. The central gov-
ernment bears 90 percent of the total cost, covering participants’ 
wages  in  full  and  75  percent  of  materials  and  administrative 
expenses.d State governments pay for 25 percent of materials and 
administrative  costs,  the  daily  unemployment  allowance,  and  the 
expenses of the state employment guarantee council. The act also 
calls for accountability through the use of information and commu-
nication technology, social audits, and third-party monitoring.e

During the program’s first phase in 2006–07, the budget outlay 
was  US$2.49  billion.  The  program  issued  37  million  job  cards  and 
provided on average 43 person-days of work to 21 million house-
holds, totaling 0.9 billion person-days of work. Since then, the pro-
gram has expanded substantially in its coverage and budget. Dur-
ing  fiscal  year  2010–11,  55  million  households  were  provided  an 
average of 47 person-days of work, totaling 2.5 billion person-days 
at a cost of US$8.7 billion (0.51 percent of GDP).f That makes MGN-
REGA the largest workfare program in the world. Participation of the 
poor and vulnerable has been quite significant according to admin-
istrative data.

Critics argue that MGNREGA may be affecting the functioning of 
rural  labor  markets.  By  setting  the  wage  paid  by  the  program  at 
roughly Rs 100 (US$1.80) a day, it may help to enforce a sort of mini-
mum wage for all casual rural work. If that is above the normal wage 
offered, the program may be altering the supply of casual labor and 
crowding  out  private  employers.g It  may  also  be  constraining  the 
process of labor reallocation out of agriculture and into more pro-
ductive sectors. 

The  program  has  received  considerable  media  attention  be -
cause of alleged corruption, leakage, inadequate implementation, 
and the like. But few studies have attempted to assess its impact on 
rural households, rural labor markets, and productivity in a system-
atic way. Among the emerging evidence, a striking finding is that 
participation rates in areas where the program is most needed are 
not  the  highest.h  Household  surveys  show  evidence  of  rationing 
and unmet demand, limiting the poverty alleviation impact of the 
program. Yet, despite the rationing, the program is reaching poor 
people  and  attracting  women  and  disadvantaged  castes  into  the 
workforce.i One study in the state of Andhra Pradesh suggests the 
program increases expenditure on food and nonfood goods.j Evi-
dence of effects on wage levels in rural labor markets and on labor 
reallocation is still inconclusive. Studies on non-labor-market effects 
of the program are scant. 

Several  challenges  face  the  MGNREGA  program.  Addressing 
 leakage  and  transparency  is  one.  The  government  has  taken  this 
challenge  seriously, 
for  example,  through  the  adoption  of 
 biometric-unique  identification  cards.  Improving  the  quality  and 
relevance of the communal assets to generate wider and long-term 
effects  is  another  challenge.  But  the  biggest  one  is  ensuring  that 
demand for work is met, and that wages are paid fully and on time. 
Also, if the program’s objective is to lift the poorest, the program 
should accommodate those whose physical conditions do not allow 
them to perform hard manual work.k

in industrial countries, training programs show 
their  real  value  only  in  the  medium  to  longer 
run.66 But a thorough understanding of the jobs 
challenge faced and a good sense of institutional 
capacities are critical when deciding whether a 
specific ALMP could be part of the solution.

Even with these innovations, expectations for 
active labor market programs need to be kept in 
check. Job search and intermediation can work 
only  if  firms  are  creating  jobs.  Short  training 
courses cannot solve a fundamental problem in 
the education system. Activation incentives will 
be fruitless if deep-rooted discrimination causes 
people to withdraw from a job search. 

cause individuals can influence that level of risk 
(moral  hazard),  markets  do  not  provide  ade-
quate risk pooling. Social insurance is a package 
of  programs  that  can  potentially  address  mar-
ket  failures  such  as  these.  But  social  insurance 
programs are also shaped by history, values, and 
politics, so their design is not exclusively aimed 
at improving efficiency.

Some countries have introduced public un-
employment insurance systems to help work-
ers  mitigate  the  risk  of  job  loss.  Many  have 
disability  insurance  to  cover  situations  where 
illness or injury affects employment opportu-
nities.  Most  countries  also  have  social  safety 
nets  that,  while  not  directly  tied  to  employ-
ment status, can provide a coping mechanism 
when earnings are insufficient to meet a basic 
living standard.

Other social insurance programs not directly 
related to labor market risks are often tied to the 
jobs  that  people  have  or  to  their  employment 
status. The most important of these are old-age 
pensions  and  health  insurance  programs  that 
are  financed  by  payroll  taxes  (social  security 
contributions)  from  employers,  employees,  or 
both.  These  benefits  are  publicly  provided  be-
cause of imperfections in the insurance market, 
not in the labor market. However, they can have 
important  consequences  for  the  types  of  jobs 
that  are  created  and  thus  for  productivity.  Fi-
nancing  them  through  payroll  taxes  can  affect 
labor demand and employer choices on whether 
to provide insurance coverage as part of the em-
ployment contract. It can also influence work-
ers’ behavior, including their incentives to take, 
keep, and switch jobs, to work in the formal or 
the informal sector, and to engage in work with 
higher risks and returns.

From a jobs perspective, the major questions 
are twofold: how to manage labor market risks 
and how to design the financing of other types 
of  social  insurance  to  have  the  most  favorable 
impact on employment. 

Social insurance: The challenge of 
expanding coverage

Many  people  are  unable  or  unwilling  to  save 
against  major  risks  such  as  job  loss,  disability, 
the  death  of  a  breadwinner,  or  aging  without 
resources.  Because  insurers  cannot  accurately 
assess individual risk (adverse selection) and be-

Managing labor market risks

In  low-income  countries,  managing  income 
loss is more important than managing the loss 
of a job. When most people are engaged in sub-
sistence agriculture or are self-employed, open 
unemployment is not a common occurrence. In 
these contexts, social safety nets, including non-

 

Labor policies revisited   

273

contributory  cash  transfers  and  public  works 
programs,  can  be  critically  important  to  cope 
with adverse shocks.67

However,  when  wage  employment  is  more 
prevalent,  unemployment  insurance  may  be  a 
higher  priority.  Unemployment  insurance  can 
provide  income  support  to  workers  who  lose 
their  jobs  and  prevent  individuals  and  house-
holds  from  falling  into  poverty.  By  supporting 
a job search, it can result in better matches and 
efficiency  gains.  Effective  coverage  is  far  from 
complete, however; according to the ILO, only 15 
percent of the unemployed worldwide received 
benefits during the recent financial crisis.68 An-
other concern with unemployment benefit sys-
tems is that they may reduce incentives to keep 
jobs, look for jobs, or accept a job offer. Most of 
the evidence on the incentive effects of unem-
ployment benefits comes from industrial coun-
tries and is mixed. Some studies find that more 
generous benefits—either through higher bene-
fit levels, or longer duration of benefits—can in-
crease either the length of unemployment or the 
unemployment  rate.69  Exits  from  unemploy-
ment typically increase when benefits expire.70 
Over the past decade, unemployment insur-
ance eligibility and benefits have been reformed 
in a number of countries to reduce job search 
disincentives.  While  some  disincentive  effects 
are  inherent  in  any  unemployment  insurance 
system, recent studies for Denmark, France, Ger-
many, Ireland, Italy, and Spain found that even if 
workers remain unemployed for a longer period 
of time, they are eventually able to find more sta-
ble jobs.71 Studies of unemployment insurance 
in Brazil found that benefits did not affect the 
duration of unemployment, except when work-
ers  were  moving  from  unemployment  to  self- 
employment. In this case the transition period 
was  shorter,  suggesting  that  benefits  may  have 
made it possible to start a new business.72 

Concerns about job search disincentives and 
hidden redistribution have led to some interest 
in unemployment insurance savings accounts. 
While the design can vary, workers make con-
tributions to the accounts and can draw money 
from  them  during  unemployment  spells. Any 
remaining balance is paid out when the worker 
retires  and  can  be  used  as  a  pension  top-up. 
Some  countries,  mainly  in  Latin America  but 
also  Austria  and  Jordan,  have  adopted  these 
savings accounts as an alternative approach to 

insurance-based programs. But insurance sav-
ings accounts do not allow for risk pooling, so 
that young workers and workers with frequent 
unemployment  spells  may  not  have  adequate 
savings.  To  address  this  concern,  some  plans 
have  a  redistribution  feature.  For  example, 
Chile’s program includes a Solidarity Fund to 
support  workers  whose  account  balances  are 
too  low  to  provide  adequate  income  support 
during unemployment.

In all countries, disability is an important la-
bor market risk. According to recent estimates, 
the prevalence of disability is about 15 percent 
of the adult population. Rates are higher in low-
income  countries  and  in  aging  societies.73  Al-
though many people with disabilities do work, 
inactivity  rates  among  them  are  significantly 
higher  than  for  the  overall  population.  In  in-
dustrial countries, the inactivity rate for persons 
with disabilities is about 2.5 times higher than it 
is for those without disability.74 

Disability  benefits  can  provide  important 
income protection, but costs have mounted in 
some countries and the benefits can create work 
disincentives  among  the  general  population. 
Accommodation of workplaces to persons with 
disabilities is an important strategy to encour-
age them to seek employment. Benefit systems 
can  be  adjusted  to  this  end  as  well.  In-work 
payments,  time-limited  benefits,  and  working 
tax credits are all being tested in the European 
Union.75  Countries  without  disability  benefits 
need to emphasize accommodation and rely on 
social  safety  nets  where  disability  is  associated 
with poverty. 

Financing social insurance

A  salient  feature  of  social  insurance  programs 
in developing countries is their low coverage.76 
Across  the  world  only  30  percent  of  workers 
have  access  to  social  insurance;  in  Africa  and 
Asia, the share is less than 25 percent (map 8.1). 
On average, coverage rates are highest in aging 
societies  and  formalizing  countries  and  low-
est  in  conflict-affected  countries  and  agrarian 
economies,  where  less  than  10  percent  of  the 
working population is enrolled in pension pro-
grams. In general, low-income workers are the 
least likely to be covered. In most countries in 
Latin America, coverage rates are below 10 per-
cent in the bottom income quintile but above 50

percent in the top quintile.77 Even if workers are 
covered on paper by social insurance, they may 
not necessarily receive benefits. Effective cover-
age can be reduced by fiscal pressures and low 
implementation capacity.

Coverage is low for multiple reasons, includ-
ing limited fiscal space to finance programs, low 
institutional  capacity  to  manage  the  admin-
istration  and  delivery  of  benefits,  fragmented 
schemes that cover certain groups and not oth-
ers, and program design providing weak incen-
tives  to  participate.  In  many  developing  coun-
tries, workers and firms in the informal sector 
generally  fall  outside  the  scope  of  programs. 
Reaching  the  self-employed,  farmers,  and  mi-
grants is particularly difficult. Social insurance 
laws in many countries do not cover micro- and 
small enterprises, or these firms and farms opt 
out because they cannot afford minimum con-
tribution  costs.78  Weak  enforcement  capacity 
also contributes to low coverage.

Payroll taxes (including contributions for so-
cial programs) have been the dominant means 

of  financing  social  insurance  in  most  coun-
tries. But whether payroll taxes are the optimal 
model, especially for developing countries, is in-
creasingly  being  questioned.79  Financing  social 
insurance through payroll taxes may exacerbate 
the  coverage  problem  by  creating  disincentives 
for the creation of formal sector jobs. 

Studies in countries such as Colombia, Tur-
key,  and  some  transition  countries  in  Eastern 
Europe  and  Central  Asia  have  found  that  in-
creases in the levels of social insurance contribu-
tions decreased formal employment, by varying 
amounts.80  By  contributing  to  the “tax  wedge” 
(the  gap  between  total  labor  costs  and  take-
home pay), payroll taxes to fund social insurance 
can discourage both labor demand and the will-
ingness to work. The size of this tax wedge varies 
considerably across countries. It is most signifi-
cant in industrial countries, aging societies, and 
formalizing countries (figure 8.5).

However,  a  complete  assessment  needs  to 
take  into  account  the  value  that  workers  place 
on  access  to  social  insurance.  Social  contribu-

tions should not be seen as a pure tax when con-
tributors attach value to the attendant benefits. 
And the evidence largely suggests that they do.81 
When asked to name the essential elements of a 
good job, people in China, Colombia, the Arab 
Republic of Egypt, and Sierra Leone rated access 
to  pensions  and  health  insurance  equally  with 
good  wages.  In  those  countries,  workers  who 
participate in social insurance systems indicated 
that they would require substantial income in-
creases to compensate for losing access to social 
insurance.  At  the  same  time,  workers  outside 
these systems would be willing to contribute a 
significant  portion  of  their  pay  to  participate 
(figure  8.6).82  But  design  and  implementation 
matter,  because  the  value  attached  to  partici-
pation  depends  to  a  significant  degree  on  the 
adequacy  of  benefits  relative  to  contributions 
and the efficiency and transparency of benefits 
administration. The long-term credibility of the 
social insurance system is also a critical factor, 
especially in aging societies.

In  trying  to  extend  the  coverage  of  social 
protection in developing countries, two impor-
tant issues need to be addressed. The first one 
is  which  risks  are  the  priorities  to  address.  In 
low-income countries, pensions for old-age and 
disability  and  basic  health  insurance  are  more 
important than unemployment insurance. 

The second issue is how to extend the prior-
ity programs to workers in the informal sector. 
Some  countries  are  using  technology  in  inno-
vative  ways  to  make  participation  by  informal 
sector workers easier (box 8.7). But technology 
alone  cannot  overcome  the  market  imperfec-
tions and institutional failures that result in low 
social  protection  coverage.  For  instance,  mo-
bile  phones  may  make  it  easier  for  farmers  to 
pay contributions toward health insurance, but 
those less prone to be ill may still choose not to 
enroll.  This  is  why  extending  social  protection 
coverage requires adequate regulations and re-
sources, in addition to modern “technology.” 

One approach is to run a parallel system for 
informal sector workers in conjunction with the 
contributory  system.  This  approach  addresses 
the  coverage  gap,  but  if  the  parallel  system  is 
funded  out  of  general  tax  revenue,  it  discour-
ages enrollment in the contributory system and 
can hinder the development of the formal sec-
tor. These problems could be addressed to some

BOX 8.7    Modern technology can reduce social protection costs, leakage, and corruption

Innovative  technology-based  approaches  are  transforming  the 
ways  in  which  insurance  and  other  cash  benefits  are  provided. 
India’s  new  health  insurance  scheme  for  the  poor  uses  biometric 
smart cards both to verify that households are eligible and to keep 
track of hospital procedures not involving cash payments. Almost 
30 million households now hold these smart cards. According to a 
recent report from the U.K. Department for International Develop-
ment,  “evidence  from  South  Africa,  India,  Kenya,  and  Liberia  has 
demonstrated  that  electronic  payment  systems  involving  smart 
cards or mobile phones can significantly reduce costs and leakage.”a 
Another report, by the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, finds 
significant reductions in transaction costs through electronic pay-
ments in Brazil and Colombia. These “front-end” applications help 
overcome  several  problems  that  have  plagued  service  delivery  in 
the past, including the need for beneficiaries to go long distances to 
obtain benefits and for middlemen to fill out forms. 

Many developing countries lack robust systems for identifying 
people,  allowing  fraud  of  various  kinds,  and  preventing  many 
among the poor from accessing social programs. In the Dominican 
Republic,  for  example,  one-quarter  of  eligible  beneficiaries  for  a 
poverty program could not participate because they lacked proper 
documents. Poor identification also hampers efforts to coordinate 
across  government  and  donor-sponsored  programs  and  leads  to 
duplication of costs. To confront this challenge, a growing number 
of countries is moving to biometric technology. India’s unique iden-
tification program, known as Aadhaar, is the most ambitious so far, 
having collected digital fingerprints and iris scans for close to 200 

million people. Applications such as mobile phones with fingerprint 
readers that would allow online verification of identity acceptable 
to service providers are now being piloted.

Less glamorous, but just as important, is the “back-end” part of 
social protection systems, which allows tracking of transactions on a 
regular basis and generation of key indicators and reports. The Man-
agement Information Systems (MIS) are arguably even more impor-
tant  for  complex  social  insurance  programs,  especially  as  popula-
tions age and noncommunicable diseases become more prevalent. 
Keeping track of work histories allows for a better alignment of pen-
sion benefits and social security contributions. Databases of medi-
cal histories support a more efficient design of health protocols and 
payments to health care providers. 

Information is no longer the sole domain of those administering 
the program, however. One of the applications of modern technol-
ogy  with  the  most  potential  impact  is  citizen  reporting  of  acts  of 
corruption  and  negligence  through  social  media.  Massive  mobile 
phone penetration has been an especially empowering tool.

Technology is not a panacea, however, and failed projects are 
common.  In  most  cases,  the  technology  is  not  matched  with  a 
re engineering of the processes involved. Other common problems 
include  poor  planning  and  procurement  practices,  asymmetric 
information between government and vendors, and lack of trained 
personnel  to  operate  the  systems  after  they  are  in  place.  Despite 
these  problems,  the  future  of  social  protection  will  inevitably 
include creative ways of applying new technology.

extent by differentiating the level of benefits be-
tween the two systems and financing the parallel 
system on at least a partially contributory basis.83
Another  approach  is  to  partially  subsidize 
participation by farmers and the self-employed 
in  general  social  insurance  programs.  In  Viet-
nam,  those  classified  as  poor  get  their  health 
insurance cards fully paid by the budget, while 
the “near poor” get a 50 percent subsidy.84 This 
second approach may look similar to the previ-
ous one, as funding relies on general tax revenue 
too. But it has the advantage of not discourag-
ing formalization. From a social cohesion point 
of view it also allows building universal systems, 
rather than two-tier systems.

Well-designed  social  insurance  and  social 
protection  systems  have  the  potential  to  en-
hance  the  three  transformations.  Mitigating 
labor  market  distortions  and  covering  priority 
risks can compensate for lost income; it can also 
contribute  to  subjective  well-being  by  reduc-
ing  uncertainty.  Portability  of  benefits  from 
one job to another and the capacity of systems 
to  manage  transitions  can  help  workers  move 
to higher-productivity jobs and encourage risk 
taking. And extending coverage can contribute 
to social cohesion through its role in building an 
encompassing social contract.85

QUeStION 8 Protecting workers or protecting jobs?

Labor policies revisited   

277

Policies that protect people are usually hailed as 
being better than policies that protect jobs. Pro-
viding income support prevents large drops in 
consumption and mitigates the risk of poverty 
among households affected by unemployment, 
underemployment,  or  loss  of  labor  earnings. 
Relying  on  transitional  income  support  and, 
in some cases retraining programs, rather than 
measures to protect jobs allows for the realloca-
tion of labor, keeping up the process of creative 
destruction. Resources are thus allocated more 
efficiently  and  economic  growth  is  enhanced. 
Preserving  jobs  that  are  no  longer  economi-
cally  viable  through  government  transfers  and 
employment protection legislation prolongs an 
inefficient allocation of resources.

Moreover, job protection also entails a high 
risk  of  capture.  It  runs  the  danger  of  becom-
ing permanent rather than temporary, creating 
enduringly  unproductive,  subsidized  jobs.  The 
development  experience  is  full  of  examples  in 
which  explicit  job  protection  has  led  to  little 
other than large rents for business owners and 
workers in the sectors that benefited from it, sti-
fling  technological  advance,  structural  change, 
and growth.

The  conventional  wisdom,  then,  argues 
against  the  protection  of  jobs.  But  in  times 
when many jobs are lost or threatened at once 
and  few  are  being  created,  such  conventional 
wisdom needs to be revisited. The productivity 
of a protected job can still be higher than that 
of the alternative jobs the displaced worker may 
find. And the productivity gap may exceed the 
costs of keeping the job alive. This is likely to be 
the case when the alternative after displacement 
is to be jobless for a long period of time. In this 
case, in addition to the immediate loss in out-
put,  prolonged  unemployment  can  depreciate 
skills and undermine social cohesion. 

Importantly, it is the overall productivity of 
the job that needs to be considered, including its 
possible spillovers on the productivity of others. 
When  people  work  together,  or  when  they  are 
connected  through  broader  value  chains,  the 
loss of a large number of jobs may have ripple 
effects  on  productivity.  In  areas  or  activities 

where  jobs  have  important  productivity  spill-
overs, the aggregate loss of output is then more 
than  the  sum  of  the  losses  in  individual  earn-
ings. Massive job losses can then lead to ghost 
towns and depressed regions, and this prospect 
suggests that the conventional wisdom may not 
always be right.

Turnover versus decoupling

Every day, jobs are created and destroyed. Work-
ers  are  hired  and  dismissed,  or  they  quit  their 
jobs and start their own businesses; meanwhile 
some firms close and others are born. In indus-
trial countries, this process of creative destruc-
tion affects around 15 percent of all jobs every 
year.86  In  normal  times,  the  probability  of  job 
loss for an individual is largely independent of 
the probability of job loss for another. And the 
probability of landing another job is also inde-
pendent of what happens to other workers. The 
employment shock is then what economists call 
“idiosyncratic.”

But  there  are  exceptional  times,  when  em-
ployment shocks are systemic. Then, a sustained 
decoupling  of  the  normal  process  of  job  cre-
ation  and  job  destruction  occurs:  jobs  are  lost 
in  large  numbers  but  not  created  at  the  same 
pace. This is what occurs in times of severe eco-
nomic crises, when a decline in economic activ-
ity affects a broad swath of firms and industries. 
Job  destruction  accelerates,  often  sharply,  and 
job creation levels off or even decreases (figure 
8.7). This decoupling leads to unemployment in 
formalized  economies  and  under-employment 
in  less  formalized  ones.87  In  many  countries, 
droughts, floods, or other natural disasters can 
have a similar impact. After the sources of the 
crisis dissipate, job creation picks up and unem-
ployment  or  underemployment  declines.  The 
longer  it  takes  for  job  creation  to  recover,  the 
longer  unemployment  or  under employment 
lasts.

Decoupling can also occur in times of mas-
sive  structural  change  brought  about  by  rapid 
technical  progress  (for  example,  the  introduc-
tion of computers) or policy reforms (for exam-

ple, trade liberalization). Structural change can 
affect entire industries. In transition economies, 
such changes were enormous, as entire sectors 
economies  had  to  cope  with  uncertainty  and 
adapt  to  new  incentives.  Public  sector  restruc-
turing  or  the  privatization  of  state-owned  en-
terprises can cause a similar shock. In all these 
cases,  unemployment  and  underemployment 
can be large and long-lasting. 

Losses in earnings and output are more per-
vasive with systemic shocks than with idiosyn-
cratic  shocks.  But  sometimes  these  two  types 
of employment shocks can overlap. The recent 
financial  crisis  has  led  to  an  unusually  deep  
recession  in  many  countries.  In  the  United 
States, high unemployment rates have persisted, 
unemployment  spells  have  lasted  longer  than 
usual, and new job creation is still sluggish four 
years  after  the  beginning  of  the  crisis.88  Some 
argue that the crisis is not a regular cyclical per-
turbation but the manifestation of a more en-
during shift caused by technological change and 
globalization.89

Decoupling hurts

Protecting people should have primacy if shocks 
are  idiosyncratic—if  the  employment  disloca-
tion is limited and if turnover continues to be 
the norm. A variety of social protection mecha-
nisms exist that support people in their transi-
tion from one job to another. They concentrate 
on sustaining standards of living through unem-
ployment benefits and public transfers. Learning 
new skills or relocating to where job opportuni-
ties are can also play a role. By moving from an 
adversely affected activity to another job, there 
is a gain in output that over time outweighs the 
cost of the support mechanisms. Protecting peo-
ple is thus good for individuals and for society.

If massive decoupling occurs—through either 
a wider crisis or large-scale structural change— 
protecting workers will rarely be enough. Inter-
mediation services falter because jobs are sim-
ply not available. Training may help individual 
workers land a job, but it does not create many 
jobs  at  the  aggregate  level,  because  it  does  not

address  the  cyclical  or  structural  causes  of  the 
employment  shock.  Income  support  through 
unemployment  benefits  and  public  transfers 
may suffer from inadequate funds or seriously 
affect  fiscal  accounts.  Only  sustained  job  cre-
ation  can  deal  with  the  effects  of  decoupling, 
but even under the best of circumstances it may 
take several years to offset the employment de-
cline from a systemic shock. The question then 
is whether providing income support on a large 
scale  for  long  periods  of  time  is  preferable  to 
temporarily supporting employment, while job 
creation picks up.

The long-term consequences and costs of de-
coupling can be higher than is usually thought. 
During  periods  of  massive  structural  change, 
the  reallocation  of  workers  out  of  declining 
 industries  can  lead  to  large  output  losses  be-
cause little alternative employment is available. 
The  productivity  of  jobs  in  declining  indus-
tries may be low, but it can still be higher than 
the  alternatives.  Similarly,  during  crises,  firms 
might not be insolvent but rather illiquid. Death 
of  inherently  solvent  firms  could  cause  loss  of 
firm-specific  human  capital  and  intangible  as-
sets,  disruption  of  value  chains,  and  damage 
to surrounding communities. While the provi-
sion of credit would be the preferred solution, 
identifying insolvent firms might not always be 
feasible  and  could  be  marred  by  transparency 
problems.  Temporary  job  protection  policies 
can be a workable alternative to provide a life-
line for struggling, but inherently solvent, firms.
Long-term  unemployment  can  also  erode 
skills and workforce attachment. Aptitudes and 
attitudes to perform a given occupation can be 
lost.90 “Scarring” can occur, with long-run con-
sequences for finding employment with similar 
earnings.91 Human capital and skills depreciate. 
Regardless of whether decoupling is the result of 
severe downturns or major structural changes, 
workers may enter a spiral of unappealing jobs 
and lower living standards. The potential costs 
might be particularly disruptive to social cohe-
sion.  Social  networks  can  be  undone  in  ways 
that  make  it  more  difficult  for  the  dislocated 
to reengage in work and even in other forms of 
social activity.92 Prolonged periods of high un-
employment are of particular concern because 
they  can  affect  young  people’s  transition  from 
school to work, and may lead to disenfranchise-
ment from society.93 

In some circumstances, then, job protection 
can be considered. What is meant by that is not 
permanent  restrictions  on  hiring  and  firing 
through employment protection legislation, but 
rather  time-bound  policy  measures  that  miti-
gate  job  destruction.  In  other  words,  these  are 
selectively used active labor market policies that 
promote  job  creation  or  sustain  existing  jobs. 
Several  countries  adopted  policies  of  this  sort 
during the recent recession; Germany, which has 
a long tradition with such policies, averted job 
losses through a coordinated reduction of hours 
of work (box 8.8). The United States also took 
measures to protect jobs during the recent reces-
sion, most notably by salvaging its auto indus-
try. But the United States relied mostly on ag-
gregate demand stimulation and on extensions 
of unemployment insurance to protect workers, 
rather than on measures to protect jobs. In rela-
tive terms, changes in employment and unem-
ployment in the United States were much larger 
than in Germany.94

The pitfalls of protecting jobs

There  are  examples  in  developing  countries 
as  well.  Chile  and  Mexico  introduced  work-
sharing  policies  and  compensatory  subsidies 
to moderate the impact of the crisis. But these 
policies had a limited impact in their case. Given 
their novelty, they required new procedures that 
were difficult to implement quickly, resulting in 
very  low  take-up  rates.  More  important,  these 
policies are not well suited to countries where a 
large share of employment is informal, because 
they fail to reach the vast majority of employers. 
The experiences of Chile and Mexico, two coun-
tries with relatively high administrative capacity 
that have made progress in formalization, sug-
gest that the usefulness of work-sharing policies 
is limited in developing “countries.”

There are positive examples as well. The dif-
ferent  ways  in  which  China  and  many  Latin 
American  countries  handled  the  restructur-
ing  of  their  economies  through  the  1980s  and 
1990s are telling. At the beginning of its reform 
process,  China  had  hundreds  of  thousands  of 
uncompetitive state-owned enterprises (SOEs). 
But large-scale labor retrenchment would have 
pushed  workers  into  even  less  productive  jobs 
until  the  private  sector  developed  sufficiently 
to  absorb  them.  China  thus  supported  its  ail-

BOX 8.8    Kurzarbeit has become a new word in labor market policies

Kurzarbeit  (which  translates  to  “short  work”  or  “reduced  working 
hours”)  has  been  used  in  Germany  for  a  century. Under  this  pro-
gram, employees in participating firms can be asked to cut down on 
working  hours  with  a  commensurate  reduction  in  compensation. 
The  German  government,  through  the  Federal  Employment 
Agency, covers a percentage of the ensuing wage loss. Participation 
of the firm is tied to the consent of the workers affected.a Thus there 
is an emphasis on social dialogue in the implementation of the pro-
gram.  During  economic  downturns,  German  employers  tend  to 
respond by reducing the number of hours worked, thereby mitigat-
ing the loss in jobs.

More  than  a  dozen  countries  have  adopted  programs  for 
reduced working hours based on the general kurzarbeit model but 
involving  a  variety  of  designs  and  regulations.b  The  countries 
where these programs were in place before the global economic 
crisis experienced substantial increases in take-up rates during the 
2008–09 period.

As  a  response  to  the  crisis,  several  countries  implementing  a 
work-share  program  increased  the  percentage  of  wages  covered, 
extended benefit duration, and relaxed the criteria for qualifying for 
the  program.  In  Germany,  the  period  during  which  firms  could 
request subsidies was extended from 6 to 24 months; the govern-
ment  coverage  of  social  insurance  costs  was  increased  to  50  per-
cent; temporary help workers were made eligible; and the program 
was allowed to cover up to 67 percent of wage losses incurred by 

affected employees.c It is estimated that more than 1 percent of per-
manent jobs were saved in Germany through kurzarbeit.d In 2009, 
more  than  3  percent  of  the  labor  force  was  covered  by  the 
program. 

The program is touted as beneficial in that it is less expensive for 
government  to  contribute  funds  toward  paying  the  lost  hours  of 
work to the employee than to pay unemployment benefits. From 
the point of view of the employer, it helps retain skilled staff and 
reduces churning and retraining costs, thus maintaining firm pro-
ductivity. From the perspective of the employee, the scheme pre-
vents unemployment and the problems that come with it such as 
loss  of  income,  depreciation  of  skills,  decrease  in  life  satisfaction, 
and insecurity. From the societal perspective, it cushions the impact 
of the economic downturn and spreads it more evenly across the 
labor force.

However,  work-share  programs  only  benefit  formal  sector 
employees, and not even all of them. The kurzarbeit is effective in 
saving permanent jobs but has no significant impact on temporary 
employment or on the hours worked by temporary workers.e Work-
share programs are also more effective in countries with less flexible 
labor market regulations, where take-up rates are higher.f Further-
more, long-term reliance on this type of program can lead to signifi-
cant delays in necessary labor reallocation and therefore could hin-
der growth and productivity in the medium term.

ing SOEs through access to banking credit while 
rapidly  modernizing  its  economy,  preventing 
social disruptions in the process.95 Latin Ameri-
can countries also embarked on the dismantling 
of inefficient industries that had developed un-
der import substitution policies. But they did so 
more  abruptly.  Sudden  downsizing  may  have 
caused  a  more  durable  rise  in  informality  and 
led to slower productivity growth.96 

The risk with job protection policies is that 
they  can  create  permanent  inefficiency,  espe-
cially  in  countries  with  weak  institutions.  Job 
protection policies involve firms or even whole 

industries that can coordinate to engage in rent 
seeking to secure permanent government sup-
port. If such policies are adopted, it is necessary 
to  establish  and  enforce  trigger  rules  and  sun-
set clauses that define the extent and size of the 
protection.  If  the  institutional  prerequisites  to 
ensure that support is temporary do not exist, 
or are not credible, job protection policies can 
be  dangerous  indeed.  And  they  should  not  be 
considered at all if job losses do not result from 
a systemic employment shock, involving a large 
decoupling of job creation and job destruction.

Rica;  and  Bell  (1997)  and  Feliciano  (1998)  for

16.  Although  some  studies  have  found  that  youth 
employment can be positively affected by mini-
mum  wage  increases  (for  example,  Card  and 
Krueger 1995), most studies have found negative 
employment effects, although the magnitude is 
typically modest (for example, Montenegro and 
Pagés 2004 for Chile; Arango and Pachón 2004 
for  Colombia;  SMERU  Research  Institute  2001 
for Indonesia; and Neumark and Nizalova 2007

for  the  United  States).  Employment  of  women 
has been found to fall in several cases as a result 
of minimum wage increases (for example, Feli-
ciano 1998 for Mexico and Arango and Pachón 
2004 for Colombia), although Pagés and Mon-
tenegro (2007) identified a shift in employment 
toward women in Chile. Where researchers have 
looked  at  employment  effects  of  minimum 
wage increases on the less skilled, they typically 
find  negative  effects  (for  example,  Arango  and 
Pachón 2004; Kertesi and Kollo 2003; Montene-
gro  and  Pagés  2004;  and  SMERU  Research  In-
stitute 2001). In general, workers in small firms 
are  most  likely  to  be  affected  by  employment 
losses caused by increases in the minimum wage 
(Kertesi  and  Kollo  2003;  Rama  2001).  Regard-
ing  EPL,  Montenegro  and  Pagés  (2004)  found 
that  the  introduction  of  more  protective  rules 
in  Chile  had  adverse  effects  for  women  rela-
tive  to  men,  for  youth  relative  to  the  more  ex-
perienced, and for the skilled relative to the less 
skilled.  Similarly,  cross-country  analysis  by  the 
Organisation  for  Economic  Co-operation  and 
Development (OECD 2004) identified negative 
impacts of EPL on women and youth. 
17.  Alatas and Cameron 2003; Rama 2001.
18.  For  minimum  wages,  a  number  of  studies  in 
Latin America find increased wage equality (for 
example, Fajnzylber 2001 for Brazil; Gindling and 
Terrell 1995 for Costa Rica; and Bosch and Mana-
corda 2010 for Mexico). OECD (2011) identifies 
declining  real  minimum  wages  and  less  restric-
tive  EPL  as  factors  behind  increasing  inequality 
in many countries.

19.  See  Messina  and  Vallanti  (2007)  for  European 
countries; Eslava and others (2004) for Colombia; 
Haltiwanger, Scarpetta, and Schweiger (2008) for 
OECD and Latin American countries; Bentolila 
and others (2011) for OECD countries; and Ca-
ballero (2004) for 60 developing and developed 
countries. Eichhorst and others (2010), however, 
found  no  systematic  difference  in  adjustment 
to shocks by EPL differences for a sample of 20 
OECD countries.

20.  Belot, Boone, and van Ours (2007) find positive 
effects, but only in environments where workers 
invested  in  firm-specific  skills.  Koeniger  (2005) 
and  Nickell  and  Layard  (1999)  find  positive 
productivity  effects,  but  results  depended  on 
estimation  specifications.  Autor,  Kerr,  and  Ku-
gler  (2007)  find  that  increases  in  employment 
protection  had  a  negative  effect  on  total  factor 
productivity  but  a  positive  one  on  labor  pro-
ductivity. In contrast, Bassanini and Venn (2008) 
and Cingano and others (2010) find negative im-
pacts. Bassanini, Nunziata, and Venn (2009) find 
that dismissal regulations have a depressing effect 
on labor but restrictions on the use of temporary 

employment do not. All of these studies are based 
on data from industrial countries. In a study of 
developed and developing countries, Micco and 
Pagés (2006) conclude that labor regulations do 
not robustly affect labor productivity. In a study 
of Asian and Latin American countries, De Freitas 
and Marshall (1998) find that job security pro-
tections  have  a  positive  productivity  effect  in 
some  situations  and  a  negative  effect  in  others. 
Bassanini and Venn (2007) find a positive effect 
of  minimum  wages  on  productivity  in  OECD 
countries.

27.  The  share  of  workers  covered  by  a  collective 
agreement  is  generally  larger  than  the  union 
membership rates. The reason is that agreements 
negotiated  between  unions  and  employers  are 
sometimes extended to other workplaces not in-
volved in the bargaining.

unemployment and lower earnings among those 
who have suffered unemployment previously. It 
implies  that  the  negative  effects  of  unemploy-
ment  extend  beyond  the  period  of  unemploy-
ment;  see  Arulampalam,  Gregg,  and  Gregory 
(2001). The term is also used to describe the psy-
chological impacts of unemployment and its du-
ration even after unemployment spells conclude; 
see Clark, Georgellis, and Safney (2001); Knabe 
and Ratzel (2009).

Beyond labor policies

Fundamentals need to be in place, and constraints to the creation  
of jobs with high development payoffs need to be removed or offset.  
Policy coordination across borders can help.

A prerequisite  for  improved  living  stan-

dards is a policy environment conducive 
to private-sector-led job creation. Macro - 
economic  stability,  an  enabling  business  envi-
ronment, human capital, and the rule of law are 
all  necessary  ingredients.  Adequate  macroeco-
nomic  policies  mitigate  aggregate  fluctuations 
and keep key relative prices aligned. The busi-
ness  environment  provides  the  basic  public 
goods needed for the private sector to  operate: 
infrastructure, access to finance, and sound reg-
ulation. Human capital is formed through good 
nutrition, health, and education that builds hu-
man skills. The rule of law ensures the enforce-
ment of contracts; it also includes the progressive 
realization  of  rights  to  avoid  a  situation  where 
growth coexists with unacceptable forms of work. 
These are the fundamentals on which policies for 
jobs rest (figure 9.1). 

Fundamentals  alone  may  not  be  enough 
to  facilitate  job  creation  and  address  the  jobs 
 challenges faced by many developing countries. 
Labor policies need to be set within a sensible 
range—a  plateau  that  avoids  two  cliffs:  one  is 
the  misguided  intervention  that  clogs  the  cre-
ation of jobs in cities and in global value chains; 
the other, the lack of voice and social protection 
especially for the most vulnerable. 

Markets might work without much friction 
but  that  may  not  be  sufficient  to  make  small-
holder  farming  more  productive  in  agrarian 

economies, or to generate enough employment 
opportunities for young men in conflict- affected 
countries.

An active role of government, however, needs 
to be carefully considered. Jobs are mainly cre-
ated  by  the  private  sector  with  government 
intervention  justified  when  individual  incen-
tives  are  misaligned  with  social  goals—when, 
for example, employment is not rewarding for 
women,  when  young  people  are  “queuing”  to 
be civil servants, when cities are too congested 
to productively absorb more rural migrants, or 
when  logistics  costs  are  too  high  for  domestic 
firms to engage in international trade. In these 
cases, government policy should aim to remove 
the constraints that prevent individuals, farms, 
and firms from making the best choices for so-
ciety.  If  constraints  cannot  be  precisely  identi-
fied, or reforms are not politically feasible, poli-
cies can aim at offsetting the constraints rather 
than relieving them directly. In most cases, the 
policies to create good jobs for development lie 
outside of the labor market.

Domestic policies for jobs are part of the so-
lution,  but  there  is  also  scope  for  international 
coordination. Rights are a global public good—
their violation in one country harms the world. 
But policies for job creation in one country can 
affect  employment  and  earnings  in  another, 
positively or negatively, while migration policies 
can generate opportunities abroad or shut them

down.  Labor  standards,  rules  for  international 
trade  and  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI),  and 
migration  agreements  are  among  the  instru-
ments  available  to  manage  these  international 
spillovers. Inter national organizations have a role 
to play  in coordinating the important global proj-
ect of  producing and using high-quality data on 
jobs, on which sound policy making must rest.

FUNDAMENTALS

Establishing the fundamentals

A vast majority of jobs are created by the pri-
vate sector—in formal sector firms as well as in 
microenterprises and farms. The relevant condi-
tions for private sector investment and job cre-
ation are macroeconomic stability, an enabling 
business  environment,  human  capital,  and  the 
rule of law. 

Macroeconomic stability

In  its  assessment  of  the  policy  ingredients  of 
growth strategies across 13 successful develop-
ing countries, the Commission on Employment 
and  Growth  noted:  “No  economy  can  flour-
ish  in  the  midst  of  macroeconomic  instability. 
Wild fluctuations in the price level, the exchange 
rate,  the  interest  rate,  or  the  tax  burden  serve 
as a major deterrent to private investment, the 
proximate  driver  of  growth.”1  Macroeconomic 
instability also affects employment and earnings 
in the short run. According to a recent estimate, 
a  1  percent  decline  in  gross  domestic  product 
(GDP)  is  associated  with  an  increase  in  the 
unemployment  rate  of  0.19  percentage  point 
in Japan, 0.45 in the United States, and 0.85 in 
Spain.2

In developing countries, where income sup-
port  mechanisms  are  more  limited,  the  short-
term impact of macroeconomic instability is of-
ten not so much on open unemployment as it is 

on the composition of employment. Economic 
downturns lead to transitions to informal em-
ployment or to household-based activities, and 
not  necessarily  to  joblessness.  Hence,  research 
focuses on how macroeconomic fluctuations af-
fect  the  share  of  informal  employment,  rather 
than  the  unemployment  rate.3  Country  case 
studies  of  the  impact  of  the  global  crisis  have 
confirmed the resilience of employment in de-
veloping  countries.  But  macroeconomic  sta-
bility is not less relevant there: while aggregate 
fluctuations do not greatly affect the number of 
workers  employed,  they  do  affect  the  earnings 
of those at work as well as their access to basic 
social protection instruments.4

Macroeconomic instability is often the out-
come  of  unsustainable  budget  deficits  and  lax 
monetary  policy.  In  the  1980s,  Brazil  plunged 
into a debt and high-inflation crisis that slashed 
its economic growth and halved the share of ex-
ports in its GDP. Triggered by high international 
interest  rates  in  the  late  1970s,  the  crisis  then 
was  compounded  by  the  difficulty  of  keeping 
spending by subnational governments in check. 
Tight budgets and rigid monetary policy rules 
may not be a magic wand, however. Budget defi-
cits  are  more  or  less  worrisome  depending  on 
how  quickly  an  economy  is  growing,  whereas

the  independence  of  central  banks  needs  to 
be  weighed  against  the  overall  coherence  of  a 
development  strategy.  An  assessment  of  the 
soundness of macroeconomic management re-
quires taking account of the impact of fiscal and 
monetary policies on economic growth.5

Not  all  macroeconomic  instability  is  self- 
inflicted, however. Turbulence may result from 
shocks  over  which  countries  have  little  con-
trol, from natural disasters to crises originating 
abroad.  Precautionary  policies  can  be  adopted 
to  cushion  those  shocks  if  and  when  they  oc-
cur. But most often there is a need to respond 
with  short-term  stimulus  or  adjustment  pack-
ages.  The  effectiveness  of  these  responses  is  a 
matter of controversy. A recent study based on 
the  experience  of  29  aid-dependent  countries 
estimates  that  GDP  increases  by  close  to  0.5 
percentage points for every percentage point of 
GDP in additional government spending. This 
so-called multiplier effect is substantially lower 
than in the United States, where a range between 
0.8 and 1.5 is considered plausible.6

Wild fluctuations are only one way in which 
the macroeconomic context can adversely affect 
employment and earnings. The misalignment of 
key relative prices is another. Surges in a coun-
try’s foreign exchange earnings often lead to an 
overvaluation  of  its  currency,  making  imports 
more  affordable  and  exports  less  competitive. 
Resource-rich countries in the developing world 
face  similar  currency  appreciation  pressures.7 
The  commodity  booms  of  the  last  few  years  
have  only  strengthened  these  pressures.  Cur-
rency  overvaluation  can  also  happen  in  coun-
tries  where  large  volumes  of  foreign  assistance 
are  needed  to  jump-start  development,  cope 
with  natural  disasters,  or  facilitate  recovery  af-
ter a conflict. In Afghanistan, for instance, civil-
ian  aid  from  multilateral  and  bilateral  donors 
was estimated at around 40 percent of GDP in 
2010/11.8  Currency  overvaluation  is  a  concern 
for many other countries where foreign aid does 
not reach the levels in Afghanistan but still funds 
a significant fraction of the budget. An analysis of 
83 developing countries between 1970 and 2004 
confirms that aid fosters growth (albeit with de-
creasing returns) but induces overvaluation and 
has a negative impact on export diversification.9
Avoiding exchange rate misalignment is nec-
essary  to  sustain  a  vibrant  export  sector  and 
hence create jobs that are connected to interna-

tional markets and global value chains.10 A case 
has even been made in favor of currency under-
valuation,  on  the  grounds  that  the  export  sec-
tors  of  developing  countries  suffer  dispropor-
tionately from institutional failures and market 
imperfections.11  However,  not  all  countries  in 
the  world  can  simultaneously  have  an  under-
valued  currency. And  while  the  argument  that 
jobs  integrated  with  world  markets  have  posi-
tive growth spillovers is sensible, these jobs are 
not necessarily the ones with the highest devel-
opment  payoffs.  Different  countries  have  dif-
ferent jobs agendas, from creating employment 
opportunities for women to supporting the de-
velopment of jobs in cities. The exchange rate is 
only one instrument and would seldom be able 
to deliver on such diverse agendas.

An enabling business environment

Across firms and countries at varying levels of 
development,  the  most  important  constraints 
on formal private sector businesses are remark-
ably consistent: access to finance, infrastructure, 
and aspects of regulation including taxation and 
unfair competition (figure 9.2). Skills shortages 
are also key, but mainly in the case of large firms 
and especially in richer countries.

Access  to  finance  provides  firms  with  the 
ability to expand, to invest in new technologies, 
or  to  smooth  cash  flow  over  time.12  Financial 
markets  also  play  an  important  role  in  the  al-
location  of  resources  toward  more  productive 
uses.13 Transparency within the financial sector 
avoids resources being channeled to those with 
political  connections  or  economic  power,  and  
it  also  supports  financial  inclusion.  Expanded 
credit registries keeping track of positive as well 
as  negative  episodes  in  debtors’  histories  help 
people demonstrate that they are creditworthy. 
But  regulatory  oversight  is  needed  to  ensure 
transparency  and  competition  in  the  alloca-
tion  of  funds.  The  financial  crisis  of  2008  has 
reopened heated debates about the appropriate 
level of regulation of the financial sector and the 
need to balance prudence and stability with in-
novation and inclusion. 

Access to affordable infrastructure of reason-
able quality is, often, another top constraint to 
firm  growth  and  job  creation.  Electricity  en-
ables the use of more sophisticated technology. 
It  also  frees  up  time  from  domestic  chores;  in

rural areas, it can significantly increase women’s 
employment.14  Telecommunications  allows  for 
better information flows among suppliers, pro-
ducers,  and  customers,  and  the  Internet  and 
mobile  technology  facilitate  the  spread  of  new 
ideas. Roads provide greater access to markets, 
as do ports and airports.15

In many low-income countries, poor-quality 
infrastructure  is  an  especially  severe  challenge. 
Part of the problem stems from how infrastruc-
ture  services  are  regulated,  however,  and  not 
only  from  insufficient  resources  to  build  ad-
ditional  facilities  and  roads.  By  one  estimate, 
improved  infrastructure  was  responsible  for 
more  than  half  of  Sub-Saharan  Africa’s  recent 
growth.16  But  efficiency  improvements  stem-
ming from better management of spending and 
maintenance,  pricing  policies,  and  regulations 
would be needed to close a significant portion of 
the remaining gap in infrastructure services. In 
many countries and infrastructure sub-sectors, 
monopolies—based on political connections—
have resulted in lower quantities of services be-
ing provided, at higher prices and of lower qual-
ity  than  in  areas  where  competition  has  been 
allowed to thrive.17 

Regulation  is  another  area  that  influences 
the opportunities for businesses to grow. Some 
regulations determine the rules of the game, en-
couraging—or discouraging—certain activities. 
Others affect firms at various stages of their life 
cycle,  from  getting  started,  to  enforcing  con-
tracts,  to  closing  down.18  Regulations  impact 
on the cost of doing business, both in monetary 

terms and in time needed to comply. Steps taken 
to meet requirements or to pay fees are a burden  
to businesses, as are delays in receiving permits 
or  licenses.  The  time  it  takes  to  comply  with 
regulations  or  to  receive  permits  varies  greatly 
across  firms  in  the  same  location,  suggesting 
discretionary  power  and  corruption.19  Beyond 
these  broader  cost  measures,  regulations  affect 
the types of opportunities that are available and 
how widely they are available. Regulations can 
relieve  or  exacerbate  uncertainty  and  corrup-
tion, but they can also have a deeper influence 
on the degree of competition and thus the struc-
ture of industries in the economy. 

Because  business  regulations  affect  the  de-
gree of competition, they shape the pressures to 
innovate  and  increase  productivity.  Competi-
tion contributes to the reallocation of resources 
from  inefficient  activities  to  more  productive 
ones.  Regulations  that  serve  to  protect  an  in-
dustry or deter new entrants can be particularly 
costly in terms of forgone output and employ-
ment  growth.20  Across  countries,  regulations 
on business entry are inversely correlated with 
productivity  and  firm  creation,  with  stronger 
effects in sectors that tend to have higher turn-
over  rates.21  Easing  entry  requirements  helped 
increase  business  registration  and  employ-
ment and drove down prices for consumers in 
Mexico. The effect was achieved largely through 
creation of new firms rather than formalization 
of existing informal firms.22 Combining relaxed

logistics, tends to be more effective than simply 
easing entry.23

Human capital

Good nutrition, health, and education outcomes 
are  development  goals  in  themselves,  because 
they  directly  improve  people’s  lives.  But  they 
also  equip  people  for  productive  employment 
and open job opportunities—and through this 
employment channel, human capital drives eco-
nomic  and  social  advances.  According  to  the 
Commission on Growth and Development, “ev-
ery country that sustained high growth for long 
periods put substantial efforts into schooling its 
citizens and deepening its human capital.”24 

Connections  between  human  capital  and 
jobs  are  manifold.  There  is  robust  evidence 
from around the world that each additional year 
of schooling raises labor earnings substantially, 
and  that  this  earnings  premium  reflects  the 
higher productivity of more educated workers.25 
Together, nutrition, health, and education form 
skills and abilities that have been clearly linked 
to  productivity  growth  and  poverty  reduction 
in  the  medium  to  longer  run.26  Better  health 
also  brings,  directly,  higher  labor  productivity. 
For example, where malaria is endemic, work-
ers can expect to suffer an average of two bouts 
of fever each year, losing 5 to 10 working days 
each time.27 In rural Ethiopia, onchocercal skin 
disease lowers the earnings of affected workers 
by  10  to  15  percent.28  As  such,  human  capital 
becomes a fundamental ingredient for desirable 
job outcomes. 

Human capital formation is cumulative. It is 
a life-cycle process that proceeds in consecutive 
stages,  each  of  them  building  on  the  previous 
one. Of crucial importance are adequate health 
and nutrition during the first 1,000 days of life, 
from inception to two years of age. Brain devel-
opment  in  this  period  affects  physical  health, 
learning abilities, and social behavior through-
out  life.29  In  the  early  years,  a  child  develops 
all the basic brain and physiological structures 
upon which later growth and learning depend. 
Stunting in early childhood has been proven to 
have  a  significant  negative  effect  on  cognitive 
development; iodine deficiency can lead to poor 
brain  development;  and  insufficient  cognitive 
stimulation  reduces  learning  abilities.  Ensur-
ing  adequate  nutrition,  health,  and  cognitive 

stimulation  through  a  nurturing  environment 
from  the  womb  through  the  first  years  of  life 
raises  significantly  the  returns  to  later  educa-
tion  investments.30  Supporting  young  children 
born into poverty during these crucial develop-
ment  phases  can  significantly  improve  equal-
ity of opportunities. The later the support, the 
more difficult and costly it is to put that child 
back on a normal developmental trajectory. In 
Romania, during the early transition years, the 
cognitive  performance  of  orphans  was  lower 
the older they were when they left state orphan-
ages. Social, emotional, and cognitive isolation 
was common in these facilities.31

While  foundations  are  laid  early  on,  hu-
man  capital  and  skills  continue  to  be  formed 
throughout  childhood,  young  adulthood,  and 
working  life.  Schooling  is  fundamental  for  the 
further  development  of  cognitive  and  social 
skills until the end of adolescence, but learning 
abilities continue to be shaped by physical and 
mental  health.  Social  skills  remain  malleable 
through  adolescence  and  early  adult  years.32 
Young  adults  can  continue  into  more  special-
ized  skill-building,  including  at  tertiary  levels, 
but their success depends on whether they have 
acquired the generic skills needed to learn and 
adapt to different tasks and problem- solving en-
vironments. These abilities are especially impor-
tant in more dynamic economies.

Unfortunately, the evidence shows that many 
countries  are  falling  short  in  building  up  the 
human capital of their children and youth. The 
quality  of  delivery  systems  has  often  failed  to 
keep pace with the expansion of access to basic 
social  services.  In  education,  for  example,  by 
2010, the net primary school enrollment rate in 
low-income  countries  had  reached  80  percent, 
primary  school  completion  was  at  68  percent, 
and  gross  lower  secondary  school  enrollment 
exceeded  50  percent.33  But  learning  outcomes 
were  clearly  lagging  behind.  In  a  large  major-
ity  of  developing  countries  that  took  part  in 
the  Programme  for  International  Student  As-
sessment (PISA) in 2009, at least 20 percent of 
15-year-old students were functionally illiterate. 
For a number of countries, including Indonesia, 
the Kyrgyz Republic, Panama, Peru, Qatar, Tuni-
sia, and the two Indian states that participated in 
the PISA, more than 60 percent of 15-year-old 
students failed to reach this level. Similarly, early 
reading  tests  taken  at  the  end  of  second  grade 

 

Beyond labor policies

revealed that, in diverse countries, a significant 
share  of  students  were  unable  to  read  a  single 
word:  around  30  percent  in  Honduran  rural 
schools,  50  percent  in  The  Gambia  and  more 
than 80 percent in Mali.34 Enrollment numbers, 
hence, do not necessarily signal actual learning 
and skill building.

The rule of law and respect for rights

Across  countries,  the  presence  of  institutions 
that  uphold  the  rule  of  law  is  associated  with 
higher  levels  of  development  (figure  9.3).35 
Clear property rights and institutional mecha-
nisms  that  strengthen  governance  can  create  a 
climate in which firms are willing to make in-
vestments, enter into contracts, and create new 
jobs. In such a climate, individuals may be more 
inclined to take the risks needed to set up new 
businesses and become entrepreneurs.36 

The link between respect for property and de-
velopment is well established.37 Property rights 
foster  private  sector  growth  by  allowing  firms 
to  invest  without  fearing  that  their  assets  will 
be stolen or confiscated. The ability to enforce 
contracts widens the circle of potential suppliers 
and customers, as personal connections become 
less  important  in  establishing  trust.38  Entre-
preneurs  who  believe  their  property  rights  are 
secure reinvest more of their profits than those 
who do not.39 Increasing the security of prop-
erty  rights  often  involves  setting  up  effective 
titling  and  registration  processes.  Mechanisms 
for valuing and protecting other types of prop-
erty, including legislation governing intellectual 
property, are also important.

Rampant  crime  and  violence  can  be  devas-
tating  for  development  and  for  job  creation.40 
Lawlessness can drive firms away and discourage 
domestic and foreign investment. Across coun-
tries,  investment  climate  surveys  consistently 
find  crime  and  corruption  to  be  obstacles  to 
conducting business.41 Inclusive and responsive 
institutions, which lead to a reduction of violent 
behavior, increase safety and security. Strength-
ening efforts to detect and prosecute white-collar 
crime and malfeasance can reduce corruption. 

An effective judicial system is a key ingredi-
ent for enforcing property rights and reducing 
crime  and  corruption.  An  independent,  ac-
countable,  and  fair  judiciary  can  contribute  to 
private  sector  growth  and  job  creation  by  en-

forcing  the  rules  that  govern  transactions  and 
helping  ensure  that  the  costs  and  benefits  of 
growth are fairly distributed.42 The justice sys-
tem  can  enforce  contracts,  reduce  transaction 
costs for firms, and create a safe and more pre-
dictable  business  environment.43  The  presence 
of  effective  courts  increases  the  willingness  of 
firms to invest.44 

An  institutional  environment  that  respects 
rights is another integral part of the rule of law. 
The  International  Labour  Organization’s  core 
labor standards provide guidance on what is un-
acceptable in the areas of child labor, forced la-
bor, discrimination, and freedom of association 
and  collective  bargaining.45  Health  and  safety 
at  work  also  necessitate  attention  by  govern-
ments and employers. Ensuring that standards 
are enforced in practice requires providing ac-
cess to information to workers and employers. 
Information  can  increase  the  extent  to  which 
workers  are  able  and  willing  to  hold  employ-
ers and intermediaries accountable. It can also 
help ensure that all parties involved are aware of 
their obligations. Strengthening institutions for 
enforcement  and  grievance  redress  is  another 
necessary building block.

Ensuring  that  rights  and  standards  are  up-
held requires a focus not only on implement-
ing acquired rights but also on expanding their 
reach to workers in jobs that fall outside of for-
mal laws and regulations. Associations of infor-
mal  workers  can  play  a  key  role  in  informing 
them,  helping  them  access  legal  mechanisms, 
and  offering  them  collective  voice.  But  often, 
information  alone  is  not  enough:  garment 
workers in the Lao People’s Democratic Repub-
lic reported that they were told about their basic 
conditions of employment, but they did not al-
ways understand the details, nor how to enforce 
their  rights.46  Not  only  can  organizations  of 
informal  workers  support  workers  in  learning 
about  and  accessing  rights  and  standards,  but 
they can also bring cases to court on behalf of 
individuals and groups.47 

The quality of institutions for accountability 
affects the extent to which labor rights are en-
forced in practice.48 Because court proceedings 
are often lengthy and costly, alternative mecha-
nisms for resolving disputes, including concilia-
tion, mediation, and arbitration prior to court 
hearings can expand access to justice and griev-
ance  redress.49  These  alternative  mechanisms 
are  especially  valuable  to  workers  who  cannot 
access  the  court  system  due  to  high  costs  or 
other barriers.

PRIORITIES

LABOR 
POLICIES

FUNDAMENTALS

Setting policy priorities for jobs

In  addition  to  ensuring  that  the  fundamentals 
are in place and that labor policies are set in a 
sensible  range,  decision  makers  can  help  real-
ize  the  development  payoffs  that  come  from 
jobs. Some jobs do more than others for living 
standards,  productivity,  and  social  cohesion. 
What  those  jobs  are  depends  on  the  country 
context—its  level  of  development,  demogra-

phy,  endowments,  and  institutions.  In  some 
circumstances,  there  are  no  constraints  to  the 
emergence  of  good  jobs  for  development  and 
no specific policy is needed. In others, govern-
ments can support the private sector in creating 
more of these jobs. Sometimes removing exist-
ing constraints that impede the creation of jobs 
with  high  development  payoffs  is  possible.  In 
other cases, policies may need to circumvent the 
constraints.

A  simple  approach  to  setting  policy  priori-
ties follows a series of steps. First, the country 
context must be assessed and the particular jobs 
challenge or challenges it faces must be identi-
fied. The second step is examining whether the 
jobs  with  the  highest  development  payoffs  are 
really  the  most  attractive  to  individuals  or  the 
most profitable for firms. When incentives are 
aligned—with  the  individual  and  social  value 
of jobs equal—there should be no shortage of 
good  jobs  for  development  and  intervention 
is  not  needed.  The  third  step  is  determining 
whether  the  institutional  failures  and  market 
imperfections leading to misaligned incentives 
can be pinpointed or not. The fourth step is un-
derstanding whether politically feasible reforms 
can remove or correct those failures and imper-
fections.  If  not,  the  last  step  involves  assessing 
whether incentives should be realigned through 
other policies (figure 9.4).

Step  one:  What  are  good  jobs  for  development? 
 Assessing  the  development  payoffs  from  jobs 
in a particular country context is an important 
first step in identifying priorities. The nature of 
the jobs with the greatest payoffs varies with the 
characteristics of the country, including its phase 
of development, endowments, and institutions. 
Jobs  challenges  differ  in  agrarian  economies, 
conflict-affected  countries,  resource-rich  coun-
tries, and countries with high youth unemploy-
ment, as well as in other settings. And the jobs 
with  the  greatest  development  impact  differ  as 
well, resulting in diverse jobs agendas. 

Step two: Are there enough of these jobs? A coun-
try may or may not face constraints in creating 
good jobs for development. For example, light 
manufacturing  can  offer  employment  oppor-
tunities for women, with significant impacts on 
reducing  poverty.  If  a  boom  is  under  way,  the 
development payoff of new manufacturing jobs

might materialize. If so, it is difficult to justify 
government  interventions  beyond  establishing 
the fundamentals and adopting adequate labor 
policies.

Misaligned  incentives  exist  when  good  jobs 
for  development  are  not  rewarding  enough  to 
individuals  or  profitable  enough  to  farms  and 
firms. Data and analysis can be used to identify 
gaps between the individual and the social value 
of  jobs.  Arguably,  many  key  areas  in  develop-
ment  economics  deal  with  these  gaps.  For  in-
stance, the tools of public finance can be applied 
to measure the tax burden on capital and labor 
and  to  assess  the  extent  of  cross-subsidization 
between individuals or firms. Labor economics 
methods can be used to uncover gaps between 
the actual earnings of specific groups of work-
ers and their potential earnings. Poverty analy-
ses help in identifying the kinds of jobs that are 
more likely to provide opportunities to the poor, 
or the locations where job creation would have a 
greater impact on poverty reduction. Productiv-
ity studies can help quantify the spillovers from 
employment  in  FDI  companies,  in  firms  con-
nected to global markets, or in functional cities. 
Environmental studies shed light on the carbon 

footprint and pollution created by various types 
of jobs. And analysis of values surveys can dis-
cover which types of jobs link to networks and 
provide social identity.

Step  three:  Can  the  constraints  be  identified?  
Understanding  why  the  individual  and  social 
values  of  specific  types  of  jobs  differ  is  next. 
Gaps of this sort indicate the presence of unex-
ploited spillovers from jobs. The gaps typically 
arise  from  market  imperfections  and  institu-
tional failures that cause people to work in jobs 
that are suboptimal from a social point of view, 
lead firms to create jobs that are not as good for 
development as they could be, or connect peo-
ple less through jobs than would be socially de-
sirable. But identifying where those constraints 
are is not always easy. For instance, a broad set 
of  cultural,  social,  and  economic  forces  may 
result  in  insufficient  employment  opportuni-
ties for women. Similarly, it may be difficult to 
pinpoint  whether  the  key  obstacles  to  making 
cities functional lie in the land market, or in the 
institutional arrangements to coordinate urban 
development, or in the ability to raise revenue to 
finance infrastructure.

Step  four:  Can  the  restraints  be  removed?  If  the 
institutional failures and market imperfections 
leading to misaligned incentives can be identi-
fied, reforms should be considered. It is a good 
economic  principle  to  target  reforms  to  the 
failures  and  imperfections  at  the  root  of  the 
problem. Where reforms are technically and po-
litically  feasible,  policy  makers  should  directly 
tackle the major constraints hindering the cre-
ation of more good jobs for development.

Step five: Can the constraints be offset? Reforms 
might  not  be  feasible,  technically  or  politi-
cally.  Or  perhaps  the  constraints  for  jobs  are 
not identifiable. An alternative is to enact off-
setting policies that can restore the incentives 
for  job  creation.  For  instance,  if  a  diffuse  but 
entrenched  set  of  priors  and  beliefs  makes  it 
difficult for women to work, efforts could aim 
at  increasing  their  employability  through  tar-
geted  investments  and  interventions  in  social 

and  physical  infrastructure  (box  9.1).  Simi-
larly, if politically charged regulations slow the 
reallocation  of  labor  toward  more  productive 
activities,  urban  infrastructure  and  logistics 
could enhance the attractiveness of jobs in cit-
ies and jobs connected to world markets (ques-
tion 9). But there are cases when constraints can 
neither be removed nor offset. An engagement 
strategy  involving  a  deeper  analysis  of  the  op-
tions and buy-in by key stakeholders is needed 
then.

Policy making to remove or offset constraints 
has to be selective and supported by good public 
finance principles. The costs and benefits of pol-
icy options need to be assessed, but the calcula-
tions are different when the overall development 
impact is the guiding objective. But they are also 
more  difficult.  For  instance,  an  employment 
program for ex-combatants in a conflict-affected 
country  could  be  assessed  in  terms  of  whether 
the earnings gains of participants justify the pro-

BOX 9.1    How does women’s labor force participation increase?

Some developing countries have experienced important increases 
in women’s labor force participation over a relatively short period of 
time.  Nowhere  has  the  change  been  faster  than  in  Latin  America. 
Since the 1980s, more than 70 million women have entered the labor 
force, raising the women’s labor participation rate from 36 percent 
to  43  percent.  In  Colombia,  the  rate  increased  from  47  percent  in 
1984 to 65 percent in 2006. By contrast, in the Middle East and North 
Africa, women’s labor force participation has only grown by 0.17 per-
centage points per year over the last three decades. 

Recent research attributes this rapid transformation to increases 
in  labor  force  participation  among  married  or  cohabiting  women 
with children, rather than to demographics, education or business 
cycles.  Changes  in  social  attitudes  contributed  to  the  transforma-
tion, but this is a complex area with limited scope—and justifica-
tion—for direct policy intervention. For instance, women’s partici-
pation  rates  are  very  low  in  the  West  Bank  and  Gaza,  particularly 
among married women. But this cannot be mechanically attributed 
to religion, as countries like Indonesia have high participation rates. 
Other social norms and regulations prevent women from participat-
ing, despite their willingness and capacity to do so. 

While the scope to influence social attitudes is limited, evidence 
suggests that public policies and programs in other areas have an 
important role to play. It also suggests that a combination of tar-
geted  investments  and  interventions  in  social  and  physical  infra-
structure  can  modify  women’s  labor  force  participation  and  the 

returns to their earnings. These investments and interventions can 
be  categorized  into  three  groups.  They  can  address  shortages  in 
the  availability  of  services  (such  as  lack  of  electricity  or  daycare 
facilities)  that  force  women  to  allocate  large  amounts  of  time  to 
home production. They can make it easier for women to accumu-
late productive assets, such as education, capital, and land, facili-
tating their entry into high- productivity market activities. And they 
can remove norms or regulations that imply biased or even discrim-
inatory  practices,  preventing  women  from  having  equal  employ-
ment opportunities. 

There  are  successful  experiences  with  targeted  investments 
and interventions of these three sorts. Public provision or subsidi-
zation  of  child  care  can  reduce  the  costs  women  incur  at  home 
when  they  engage  in  market  work.  Examples  include  Estancias 
Infantiles in Mexico, Hogares Comunitarios in Colombia, and similar 
programs in Argentina and Brazil. Improvements in infrastructure 
services—especially in water and electricity—can free up women’s 
time spent on domestic and care work. Electrification in rural South 
Africa,  for  instance,  has  increased  women’s  labor  force  participa-
tion by about 9 percent. Correcting biases in service delivery insti-
tutions, such as the workings of government land distribution and 
registration  schemes,  allows  women  to  own  and  inherit  assets. 
Finally,  the  use  of  active  labor  market  policies,  the  promotion  of 
networks,  and  the  removal  of  discriminatory  regulations,  are 
important to make work more rewarding for women.

gram costs. But a full accounting would need to 
incorporate  the  potentially  positive  effects  on 
peace  building.  In  the  Democratic  Republic  of 
Congo, the cost of a reintegration program for ex- 
combatants was about US$800 per beneficiary.50 
Such a program would likely be judged as cost 
inefficient by traditional standards. Whether or 
not  it  is  still  worth  implementing  depends  on 
the  implicit  value  policy  makers  attach  to  its 
social  cohesion  benefits.  These  spillovers  from 
jobs may not be measured precisely, but at least 
they should be stated, for policy decisions to be 
transparent. 

Diverse jobs agendas,  
diverse policy priorities

Following  a  protocol  to  identify  constraints  to 
the creation of good jobs for development, and 
then remove or offset them, may sound abstract. 
But some countries have successfully done this 
in  practice,  and  it  is  possible  to  learn  directly 
from their experiences (box 9.2). The stories of 
Vietnam,  Rwanda,  Chile,  and  Slovenia,  show 
that policy can effectively support the creation 
of jobs with high development payoffs. Each of 
these countries faced a different jobs challenge, 
so  their  policy  choices  are  relevant  for  other 
countries  confronted  with  similar  jobs  agen-
das. Getting the fundamentals right by ensuring 
macroeconomic  stability,  improving  the  busi-
ness environment, and adhering to the rule of 
law,  featured  prominently  in  all  four  cases. All 
four countries also embraced labor policies and 
institutions within a reasonable range. But it is 
telling  that  the  main  constraints  they  targeted 
were not in the labor market. 

Agrarian economies: Vietnam

Increasing  productivity  in  agriculture,  thereby 
freeing up labor to work in rural off-farm em-
ployment and to eventually migrate to cities, is 
the  main  challenge  facing  agrarian  economies. 
At  the  beginning  of  its  economic  reform  pro-
cess, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Vietnam 
was a clear illustration of this challenge. In 1993, 
the first year for which reliable data exist, over 
70  percent  of  employment  was  in  agriculture, 
58  percent  of  the  population  lived  in  poverty, 

and famine was not a distant possibility.51 Two 
decades  later,  Vietnam  is  the  world’s  second- 
largest  exporter  of  rice  after  Thailand;  the 
second- largest exporter of coffee after Brazil; the 
largest  exporter  of  pepper;  and  a  top  exporter 
of  rubber,  cashew  nuts,  and  seafood  products. 
The poverty rate declined to 16 percent by 2006, 
the  fastest  reduction  in  poverty  ever  recorded. 
These two decades of accelerated progress took 
Vietnam  out  of  the  least-developed-country 
category  and  made  it  a  lower-middle-income 
economy with upbeat growth prospects. 

Vietnam’s  transformation  from  an  inef-
ficient  agrarian  economy  into  an  export  pow-
erhouse  started  with  land  reform.  In  the  late 
1980s and early 1990s, the country abandoned 
collectivization  by  initially  allowing  local  au-
thorities to reallocate communal land to indi-
vidual  households  and  subsequently  extend-
ing  land-use  rights  to  them.  The  devolution 
of  land  to  rural  households  was  remarkably 
egalitarian,  especially  in  the  north.52  By  1993, 
land-use rights could be legally transferred and 
exchanged, mortgaged, and inherited. Land re-
form was part of a broader package of reforms, 
or Doi Moi, which took Vietnam from central 
planning to a market economy with a socialist 
orientation.53 The package included the gradual 
removal of barriers to entry in most sectors, in-
cluding  the  commercialization  of  agricultural 
products. Competition brought farmgate prices 
much closer to international prices. Combined 
with  a  strong  emphasis  on  agricultural  exten-
sion, land reform and deregulation led to rap-
idly  growing  agricultural  productivity  on  very 
small farm plots.

In  parallel,  policies  aimed  to  create  em-
ployment  opportunities  outside  agriculture. 
Vietnam  opened  to  foreign  investors,  first  in 
selected  sectors  such  as  natural  resource  ex-
ploitation  and  light  manufacturing,  and  then 
more broadly in the context of its accession to 
the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2007. 
Registered  FDI  increased  fourfold  in  just  two 
years, from 1992 to 1994; by 2007, FDI inflows 
were consistently exceeding 8 percent of GDP.54 
Initially investors partnered with state-owned 
enterprises (SOEs), because of the complexity 
of  a  legal  system  still  in  transition.  But  SOEs 
had gradually been given the flexibility to make 
their  own  business  decisions,  and  many  were

BOX 9.2   There have been successes in tackling jobs challenges around the world

The  Republic  of  Korea  effectively  used  policies  to  bring  out  the 
agglomeration and integration benefits of an urbanizing country.a 
Almost three-quarters of the population was rural in 1960, but by 
2000, four-fifths were urban. Seoul, which has grown to more than 
10  million  people  today,  was  a  motor  for  the  country’s  overall 
growth, especially from the late 1980s until the mid-1990s. Many 
industrial clusters were established in close proximity to the capital 
city.  Carefully  designed  and  phased  urban  development  policies 
accompanied the transition from jobs in agriculture to jobs in light 
manufacturing  and  then  to  jobs  in  industries  with  higher  value 
added.  Land  development   programs  were  established  first,  fol-
lowed by a land-use regulation system, and then by comprehen-
sive  urban  planning.  Housing  and  transportation  policies  held  
the diseconomies of urbanization in check. The global integration 
of  Korea’s  urban  hubs  was  a  core  driver  of  its  growth  dynamic.  
The  country  invested  massively  in  skills  to  support  its  structural 
transfor mation. The mean years of education of the adult popula-
tion  increased  from  4.3  in  1960  to  11.8  in  2010.  International  test 
scores  now  place  Korea  at  the  top  of  Organization  of  Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries in reading, math-
ematics, and science outcomes for 15-year-olds.

Small island nations are characterized by their size, isolation, and 
exposure to climatic risks. In these circumstances, reaping the pro-
ductivity gains from agglomeration and global integration is espe-
cially challenging. Tonga is using migration as an active instrument 
to connect to the world economy.b Approximately 100,000 Tongans 
live abroad, almost as many as at home. Remittances account for an 
estimated 32 percent of GDP and reach 80 percent of households, 
raising the education levels and productive investments. Migration 
agreements also reach poorer and less-skilled workers. In 2007, New 
Zealand  launched  the  Recognized  Seasonal  Employer  (RSE)  pro-
gram, which provides temporary opportunities for seasonal workers 
from the Pacific to work in horticulture and viticulture. For the house-
holds  of  participants,  the  program  has  led  to  income  gains  of  up  
to  38  percent,  more  purchases  of  durable  goods,  and  a  broader 
improvement  in  well-being.  In  addition  to  income,  RSE  workers 
brought home their newly acquired knowledge of agricultural tech-
niques, computer literacy, and English-language skills.

Formalizing  countries  can  envision  increasing  the  coverage  of 
their social protection systems to levels typical of industrial coun-
tries.  But  costs  are  high,  as  is  the  risk  of  distoring  incentives  and 
undermining productivity. Brazil is one country that has been able 
to  not  only  grow  quickly  but  expand  the  formal  sector  in  the 

process.c  Benefiting  from  a  booming  global  commodities  market 
and  a  competitive  exchange  rate,  its  economy  was  growing  at 
around 5 percent a year before the 2008 financial crisis. But unlike 
other rapidly growing countries, Brazil’s job creation in the formal 
sector was three times as high as in the informal sector. Just in the 
five years leading up to the crisis, the formal share of total employ-
ment increased by about 5 percentage points. In some ways, Brazil 
is an unlikely “formalizer”—it has a heavily regulated business sec-
tor and a costly labor system. Although its rapid formalization is too 
recent to be fully explained yet, it appears efforts to simplify and 
extend the reach of programs and regulations have been contrib-
uting  factors.  The  government  has  expanded  the  coverage  of  its 
social protection system through noncontributory programs. It has 
also simplified tax rules for small businesses, increased incentives 
for firms to formalize their workers, and improved enforcement of 
tax and labor regulations. 

In  aging societies  the  increase  in  the  old-age  dependency  ratio 
reduces the average productivity per person, while the growing costs 
of caring for the elderly undermine living standards. But the reforms 
needed to address these challenges are politically difficult to imple-
ment  and  often  involve  hard  tradeoffs.  Poland  is  an  example  of  a 
country that has taken several successful steps.d By the turn of the 
century,  labor  force  participation  rates  were  declining  due  to  the 
growing  incidence  of  early  retirement  and  disability  pensions.  But 
several reforms that reduced the inflows of new beneficiaries led to 
an increase in the employment-to- population ratio from 60 percent 
in 2006 to 65 percent in 2009. Changes in the application of eligibility 
rules  of  disability  pensions,  enacted  in  2005,  sharply  reduced  the 
intake of new beneficiaries. In 2009, a pension reform tackled early 
retirement options. This reform is such that old-age pension benefits 
adjust downward as life expectancy increases. Hence, the country is 
expected  to  have  a  fiscally  sustainable  pension  system  in  the  long 
run. That sustainability came at a cost: benefits as a percentage of 
earnings at retirement became significantly lower than the average in 
the European Union. In 2012, a new wave of pension reforms raised 
the retirement age to 67 for men and women from the current 65 for 
men and 60 for women. This increase should help to raise the benefit 
level without adversely affecting fiscal sustainability. Policies and pro-
grams to ease labor market entry for the inactive and unemployed of 
all ages remain modest, however, and their impact still needs to be 
determined. Also, long-term health care continues to rely largely on 
informal arrangements, but reforms are now publicly debated.

totally or partially sold to private investors. By 
the turn of the century, greenfield FDI invest-
ments had become the norm, especially in sec-
tors  such  as  garments,  footwear,  appliances, 
and consumer electronics.55 Firms in these sec-
tors are employing workers in large numbers.
Important  challenges  remain,  but  Vietnam  is 

by now a rapidly urbanizing economy, which is 
a testimony to its success.

Conflict-affected countries: Rwanda

and genocide of the mid-1990s, and jobs contrib-

uted to such a remarkable turnaround. The con-
flict has had a severe impact on society and the 
economy, with massive loss of life, destruction of 
infrastructure,  a  crisis  of  state  institutions,  and 
a drop in GDP that exceeded 50 percent.56 The 
cessation of conflict and an aggressive package of 
reforms allowed Rwanda’s economy to rebound 
to pre-crisis levels by 2000.57 Growth has contin-
ued, reaching an estimated 8.8 percent in 2011, 
and the poverty rate fell by 12 percentage points 
between 2005 and 2010.58

A  precondition  for  sustainable  job  creation 
in countries emerging from conflict is securing 
peace and reducing risks of recurring violence.59 
In  the  wake  of  the  conflict,  the  Rwandan  gov-
ernment supported the reintegration and demo-
bilization of more than 54,000 former combat-
ants. Ex-combatants received a combination of 
cash assistance, counseling, vocational training, 
education,  support  for  income-generating  ac-
tivities, and social reintegration activities involv-
ing community members.60 More than a decade 
after the end of conflict, most former combat-
ants were participating in vocational training or 
working, mainly in subsistence agriculture and 
self-employment, similar to the rest of Rwanda’s 
population.61  Although  many  ex-combatants 
continued to experience social and psychological 
hardships,  their  relations  with  their  neighbors 
were reportedly good, and trust was improving. 
In 2012, 73 percent of ex-combatants expressed 
satisfaction with their social integration, and 85 
percent of community members felt that there 
was trust between the two groups.62

While  the  number  of  ex-combatants  only 
represents a small share of Rwanda’s total popu-
lation of 10 million, reintegration through jobs 
had social cohesion payoffs, which established a 
basis for the country to move forward. Rwanda 
has built on this start by rejuvenating the private 
sector through reforms to institutions and busi-
ness regulations.63 A good example of the gov-
ernment’s  private  sector  development  strategy 
was its decision to revitalize its coffee industry 
through  deregulation  and  investments  in  new 
technology,  a  decision  that  has  led  to  new  job 
creation.64 Rwanda still faces serious jobs chal-
lenges. More than 80 percent of the population 
works  in  subsistence  agriculture  and  house-
hold  enterprises,  where  productivity  needs  to 
be  improved.  Also,  opportunities  for  off-farm 
employment  need  to  expand,  and  growth  in 
the currently small manufacturing sector would 

help.65 But the economic reintegration and so-
cial  cohesion  through  jobs  have  established  a 
basis for future progress.66 

Resource-rich countries: Chile

While  many  countries  rich  in  resources  seem 
unable to diversify and are beset by poor gov-
ernance, Chile’s savvy management of its cop-
per riches makes it a notable exception. In 2010, 
Chile  was  home  to  28  percent  of  the  world’s 
copper  reserves  and  about  one-third  of  world 
copper  production;  for  the  past  two  decades, 
it has accounted for 17 percent of world cop-
per  exports.67  But  despite  the  prominence  of 
copper in its economy, Chile has been able to 
 diversify its exports and its economy while ef-
fectively  managing  resource-related  risks  such 
as  currency  appreciation  and  macroeconomic 
turbulence. Nonmineral exports increased sig-
nificantly  as  a  share  of  total  exports  after  the 
1980s,  before  retreating  somewhat  during  the 
global  commodities  boom  after  2007  (figure 
9.5).  Employment  in  the  nonmining  sectors 
has grown strongly at more than 2 percent an-
nually over the past two decades.68 The unem-
ployment  rate  has  averaged  around  8  percent 
over the past decade, a far cry from the record 
20 percent of the early 1980s.69

A  set  of  macroeconomic,  institutional,  ex-
port-diversification,  and  skill-building  policies 
contributed  to  this  broad-based  job  creation 
path. Chile combines the use of a resource sta-
bilization  mechanism  (since  1987,  with  the 
current  framework  adopted  in  2006)  with  a 
transparent fiscal rule (since 1999) that jointly 
regulate how copper extraction rents are used.70 
A structural surplus target is the anchor for de-
termining inflows and outflows into two funds, 
one for pensions and other long-term govern-
ment  liabilities,  the  other  for  short-term  sta-
bilization  purposes.  The  funds  are  authorized 
to  invest  their  portfolio  fully  abroad,  relieving 
pressures  on  the  exchange  rate.71  In  parallel, 
governance reforms over the past decades in all 
areas of public sector management have led to 
significant success: Chile climbed 5 percentiles 
in  its  voice  and  accountability  rating  between 
1996  and  2009  and  also  improved  its  political 
stability and control of corruption ratings.72 

Further,  Chile  adopted  an  active  export- 
oriented  growth  policy,  opening  up  to  trade 
and  welcoming  direct  foreign  investment,

thereby  enhancing  the  productivity  spillovers 
from  global  integration.  An  ambitious  inno-
vation  strategy  to  raise  competitiveness  was 
developed.73  Public  funds  were  used  specifi-
cally  to  boost  education  expenditures,  which 
almost  doubled  in  real  terms  between  1990 
and 2009.74 While quality as well as equity in 
the education system are much debated today, 
the share of low-skilled workers declined in all 
economic sectors.75 

Countries with high youth unemployment: 
Slovenia

Slovenia  has  made  inroads  into  the  problem 
of  high  youth  unemployment  (figure  9.6). 
Throughout the first decade after the breakup of 
the former Yugoslavia, young people were three 
times  as  likely  as  adults  to  be  unemployed.  By 
2010, this ratio had fallen to two to one.76 The 
youth employment rate, which was 10 percent-
age  points  above  the  European  Union  (EU) 
aver age in 2000, was lower than the EU  average 
in 2010.77 By then, the share of Slovenia’s youth 
not in education, employment, or training was 
just  7.5  percent  among  the  15-  to  24-year  age 
group,  well  below  the  EU  average  of  11.2  per-
cent.78 While the crisis has certainly been felt by 

young people, European Commission President 
José Manuel Barroso recently highlighted Slove-
nia as an example of best practice in the employ-
ment of youth.79 

Slovenia’s relative success in reducing youth 
unemployment  does  not  strictly  follow  tradi-
tional recipes. Its spending on active labor mar-
ket policies is about average for transition coun-
tries. Although some reforms have been made to 
liberalize the rules for contract and temporary 
work, Slovenia’s labor regulations remain more 
restrictive than the Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development (OECD) aver-
age,  a  policy  stance  that  is  usually  associated 
with reduced job opportunities for young peo-
ple. Minimum wages—also frequently cited as a 
barrier for youth employment—are on the high 
side. But potential distortions from these poli-
cies seem to be somewhat offset by a model of 
consensus-based  decision  making.  In  Slovenia, 
trade unions and employers’ organizations, both 
with broad coverage, set wages that respond well 
to macroeconomic trends and sectoral produc-
tivity patterns.80

Sustained  growth  supported  by  increased 
competition  in  product  markets,  is  ultimately 
responsible  for  much  of  Slovenia’s  decrease  
in  youth  unemployment.  Taking  advantage  of

European integration, the economy successfully 
restructured its export sector to access EU mar-
kets. Very good infrastructure and a fairly skilled 
workforce  helped  as  well.  This  dynamism,  re-
quiring  the  use  of  more  advanced  production 
and  management  techniques  in  modern  sec-
tors, was especially well-suited for youth. While 
the  story  is  a  good  one  in  many  ways,  further 
policy reforms could help Slovenia realize more 
of the development payoffs that flow from jobs 
for young people. Some of these reforms are in 
the labor market, such as removing the incen-
tives  created  by  employment  protection  laws 
that tilt job creation for youth toward contract 
and temporary work. But others are outside the 
labor market, such as introducing measures to 
encourage more FDI.81 

Connected jobs agendas: Global 
partnerships for jobs

Policies for jobs in one country can have spill-
overs  on  other  countries,  both  positive  and 
negative.  An  important  issue  is  whether  inter-
national  coordination  mechanisms  could  in-
fluence  the  decisions  that  governments  make, 
enhancing  the  positive  spillovers  and  mitigat-
ing the negative ones. Several areas lend them-
selves  to  coordination.  Promoting  compliance 
with rights and labor standards, a global public 
good, is the most obvious one, but the effective-
ness of the mechanisms for doing so is limited. 
Measures  to  facilitate  FDI  flows,  especially  in 
services, would have substantial effects on pro-
ductivity in developing countries but they may 
also have social implications. Migration has im-
pacts on both sending and recipient countries, 
suggesting that bilateral agreements could lead 
to better outcomes for both parties. 

Rights and standards: Pressure goes only 
so far

Several  mechanisms  operating  across  borders 
exist  to  set  standards  and  provide  channels 
for  improving  workers’  rights  and  their  work-
ing  conditions.  They  include  the  issuance  and 
ratification  of  ILO  conventions,  bilateral  and 
multilateral trade agreements, and initiatives in-
volving the private sector, civil society, and other 
stakeholders. These mechanisms operate either

through peer pressure or by providing positive 
incentives for governments and firms to comply. 
But it is not certain that these kinds of pressures 
and incentives actually change working condi-
tions on the ground, and the risk that improve-
ments come at the expense of job creation can-
not be ruled out.

ILO  conventions  provide  a  framework  for 
rights,  standards,  and  conditions  at  work.  At 
the  country  level,  conventions  can  influence 
domestic  legislation  if  countries  do  align  their 
laws with global standards. They can be a chan-
nel  for  voice  and  coordination  internationally, 
as  demonstrated  by  the  adoption  of  conven-
tions  for  home-based  and  domestic  workers.82 
Evidence from the ratification of the eight con-
ventions included in the ILO’s 1998 Declaration 
on Fundamental Rights and Principles at Work 
(the  core  labor  standards)  suggests  that  coun-
tries respond to pressure from the international 
community.83 Yet,  the  persistence  of  forced  la-
bor, children working in hazardous conditions, 
discrimination,  and  lack  of  voice  also  suggests 
that ratification on its own is not sufficient.

306

Trade agreements have also been used with 
the intent of supporting workers rights. Some of 
them  incorporate  incentives  to  improve  work-
ing conditions and access to voice. For instance, 
the  1999  bilateral  trade  agreement  between 
Cam bodia and the United States included pro-
visions  to  increase  Cambodia’s  quota  for  gar-
ment imports into the United States market if 
regular reviews showed improvements in work-
ing conditions.

Whether labor clauses actually lead to better 
outcomes for workers on either side of a trade 
agreement  is  the  subject  of  a  running  debate. 
Skeptics point out that the agreements, on their 
own,  can  be  weak  instruments  for  improving 
rights and working conditions and cannot sub-
stitute for adequate enforcement of domestic la-
bor laws.84 There are also concerns about politi-
cal capture and pressures from interest groups 
and  uneven  bargaining  power  between  treaty 
parties.85 Labor clauses could be used as a pro-
tectionist tool, undermining trade and employ-
ment  opportunities  in  developing  countries. 
Supporters  claim  that  labor  clauses  in  trade 
agreements not only improve the enforcement 
of  existing  labor  and  employment  standards 
but  also  lead  to  increased  FDI  to  developing 
countries, thus benefiting workers in developing 
countries in both direct and indirect ways.86 

Linking rights to trade agreements may have 
an  impact  on  working  conditions  if  comple-
mented by investments in capacity for enforce-
ment and compliance at the country level. Af-
ter  it  signed  the  Central  America  Free  Trade 
Agreement, the Dominican Republic increased 
the  number  of  labor  inspectors  and  invested 
in capacity building.87 And after it entered the 
bilateral  trade  agreement  with  Cambodia,  the 
United  States  funded  two  ILO  projects  there. 
One  of  them,  Better  Factories  Cambodia,  in-
volved  building  capacity  for  compliance  and 
monitoring  of  working  conditions  in  garment 
factories.  The  other  supported  an  arbitration 
council  to  resolve  collective  labor  disputes.88 
Subsequent  reviews  have  found  improvements 
in working conditions and collective rights.89

Beyond  the 

initiatives  of  governments 
through  conventions  and  trade  agreements, 
there  has  been  a  growing  emphasis  on  pri-
vate  sector  accountability.  Under  the  broader 
corporate  social  responsibility  (CSR)  agenda, 
companies  voluntarily  assume  social  and  en-

vironmental  concerns  into  their  operations.90 
While  some  develop  their  own  codes  of  con-
duct, collective initiatives are increasingly im-
portant  for  improving  working  conditions 
in  global  supply  chains.  Shared  codes  enable 
companies to collaborate with other businesses 
in   industry-led  platforms,  and  with  trade 
unions and nongovernmental organizations in 
multistakeholder  initiatives  (sometimes  with 
government observers).91 

Almost all such initiatives have defined stan-
dards of practice, but they differ substantially in 
their governance structures, in their procedures 
for  implementation,  monitoring,  and  verifica-
tion,  and  in  whether  they  involve  certification 
and labeling.92 CSR initiatives focused on labor 
issues are generally concentrated in sectors rely-
ing on global supply chains that are exposed to 
reputational risk, such as garments, sportswear, 
food  and,  increasingly,  electronics.93  Codes  of 
conduct  are  most  frequently  adopted  by  com-
panies based in the European Union and North 
America,  which  then  make  compliance  with 
labor standards a condition for doing business 
with them. A small number of voluntary initia-
tives have also emerged in developing countries, 
although these are generally a response to exter-
nal pressure more than a reaction to campaign-
ing by local consumers.94 

There  is  limited  evidence  to  demonstrate 
how far CSR initiatives go beyond good inten-
tions  to  result  in  tangible  and  sustainable  im-
provements  in  rights  and  working  conditions. 
The  clearest  impacts  are  found  in  the  area  of 
health and safety and, to a lesser extent, in regu-
larization of working hours. Improvements on 
freedom  of  association  and  discrimination  are 
much less likely. Overall, the benefits are more 
pronounced  for  permanent  workers  than  for 
migrants,  agency  workers,  and  seasonal  and 
temporary workers.95 Codes do not operate in 
a  vacuum,  so  the  capacity  of  local  actors  and 
the quality of domestic laws and institutions are 
critical to the effectiveness of the efforts.96

These findings stress the need for approaches 
to  improving  working  conditions  that  extend 
to sectoral and national-level engagement with 
governments, employers, trade unions, and civil 
society organizations. Voluntary labor initiatives 
cannot substitute for domestic efforts to set up 
adequate legal protections and put in place insti-
tutions to support compliance and provide av-

BOX 9.3    Improving business practices facilitates compliance with labor standards 

The Better Work program seeks to improve compliance with inter-
national labor standards and national laws, while promoting busi-
ness competitiveness. The program operates through partnerships 
with governments, employer and worker organizations, and inter-
national  buyers.  It  currently  includes  global  garment  brands  and 
retailers with supply chains outsourcing production to Cambodia, 
Haiti, Indonesia, Jordan, Lesotho, Nicaragua, and Vietnam. 

international 

The  program  involves  thorough  workplace  assessments  that 
examine  compliance  with 
labor  standards  and 
national  labor  law,  as  well  as  advisory  services  to  help  employers 
and workers jointly create and implement improvement plans. Tai-
lored training services support workplace cooperation and address 
specific issues, such as supervisory skills, human resource systems, 
and occupational safety and health. The program undertakes public 
reporting, which presents aggregate noncompliance data from all 
participating factories in a country and allows comparisons across 
countries  according  to  specific  indicators.  A  Better  Work  global 
team  ensures  quality,  consistency,  and  effective  knowledge  man-

agement, supporting country teams with tools for advisory services, 
monitoring and evaluation, and impact assessment. 

Better Work is modeled on the Better Factories Cambodia pro-
gram, which was introduced in conjunction with the bilateral trade 
agreement  between  Cambodia  and  the  United  States.  Results  of 
evaluations  of  Better  Factories  Cambodia,  covering  more  than  90 
percent of participating factories, found that compliance on occu-
pational safety and health improved 20 percent. Correct payment of 
wages, overtime, and benefits increased 37 percent. Initially, incen-
tives  to  improve  working  conditions  were  driven  by  the  quota 
increases called for under the trade agreement; however, with the 
expiration  of  the  Multi-Fiber  Arrangement  (MFA),  quota  increases 
were  no  longer  possible.  Nevertheless,  the  Cambodian  garment 
industry  has  continued  to  invest  in  monitoring,  having  identified 
labor  compliance  as  an  important  part  of  its  claim  to  a  niche  in  
the global garment industry. This niche exists despite the expiration 
of the MFA largely because of the role that reputation plays in the 
supply chain.

enues for redress. The public and private sectors 
can  work  together,  as  in  Brazil,  where  in  2003 
the Ministry of Labor began publishing lists of 
companies found to be using forced labor. The 
increased  public  awareness  led  companies  to 
subscribe  to  a  National  Pact  to  Combat  Slave 
Labor, with civil society organizations establish-
ing a committee to monitor the pact.97

While  most  jobs  in  developing  countries 
fall  outside  the  scope  of  CSR  initiatives,  these 
efforts have the potential for a wider influence 
if  they  can  be  expanded  to  include  workers, 
mainly  women,  who  do  not  have  formal  con-
tracts. At  the  same  time,  local  governance  and 
institutions could be boosted through activities 
to  strengthen  the  capacity  of  actors  and  insti-
tutions and improve processes of dialogue and 
cooperation.  Demonstration  effects  may  also 
occur at the country level if CSR efforts increase 
the visibility of activities to improve rights and 
working  conditions,  and  if  labor  inspectorates 
and  third-party  monitoring  bodies  gain  expe-
rience  and  capacity.  The  potential  benefits  of

Further liberalizing trade, but managing 
the tradeoffs

International  trade  in  goods  has  been  gradu-
ally liberalized, and the notion that freer trade 
is  mutually  beneficial  for  the  transacting  par-
ties is now widely shared. Various mechanisms 
have  been  used  in  the  liberalization  process, 
including  multilateral,  regional,  and  bilateral 
agreements, as well as unilateral commitments. 
At the multilateral level, liberalization has been 
achieved through negotiations under the frame-
work of the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade  (GATT)  first,  and  then  of  its  successor, 
the WTO. The most recent round of multilateral 
negotiations,  the  Doha  Development  Agenda, 
aims  for  better  market  access  for  the  export-
ing industries of developing countries. Average 
bound tariffs would fall from 40 to 30 percent 
for agricultural products, and from 10 to 5 per-
cent  for  manufactures. Actual  tariffs  could  fall 
by 11 to 14 percentage points for the former, and 
by 2 to 3 percentage points for the latter. Cuts 
could  be  much  sharper  in  sectors  such  as  tex-

308 

  WO R L D   D E V E LO P M E N T   R E P O RT   2 0 1 3

tiles and clothing. The least-developed countries 
could even benefit from duty-free quota access 
on almost all of their exports to industrial coun-
tries.99 For developing countries, the success of 
the Doha Round could therefore have a substan-
tive impact on the creation of jobs connected to 
global  value  chains,  which  are  typically  good 
jobs  for  development.  But  the  Doha  negotia-
tions are in limbo.

Despite  the  progress  in  trade  liberalization, 
many  developing  countries  still  lack  the  com-
petitiveness to harness the benefits from global 
integration.  Providing  them  with  direct  as-
sistance  to  reduce  logistics  costs  and  improve 
the competitiveness of firms and farms is thus 
a priority. The Aid for Trade initiative aims to 
increase aid to developing countries so that they 
can  tap  existing  market  opportunities. Aid  for 
Trade  has  increased  substantially  and  now  ac-
counts  for  about  a  third  of  total  aid  to  devel-
oping countries. To date, most of the resources 
have  been  channeled  to  infrastructure  invest-
ments and trade facilitation. But the assistance 
could be made more effective by focusing on the 
export  activities  most  suited  to  addressing  the 
specific  jobs  challenges  facing  recipient  coun-
tries. Increasing the involvement of the private 
sector  would  also  enhance  the  effectiveness  of 
the assistance provided.100 

In contrast to trade in goods, services liber-
alization  has  made  slow  progress,  at  both  the 
multi lateral and the regional levels. Services are 
subject  to  more  pervasive  regulations,  because 
they  are  characterized  by  well-known  market 
imperfections.  These  range  from  natural  mo-
nopolies in the distribution of electricity to net-
work  externalities  in  telecommunications,  and 
from asymmetric information and moral hazard 
in finance to market power in retail trade. While 
the liberalization of trade in goods is  associated 
with  domestic  liberalization,  the  liberalization 
of  trade  in  services  usually  requires  domestic 
regulation. Setting up markets for electricity, en-
suring universal service in telecommunications, 
adopting appropriate banking supervision, and 
managing  the  social  impacts  of  large  distribu-
tors on retail trade are challenging tasks.101

Not  surprisingly,  liberalization  in  services 
is much less advanced in developing countries 
than  in  industrial  countries.  The  former  are 
also reluctant to make additional commitments. 
Neither  existing  agreements  under  General 
Agreement  on  Trade  in  Services  (GATS)  nor 

proposals  in  the  Doha  agenda  and  in  regional 
trade discussions offer prospects for significant 
liberalization (figure 9.7). 102 

However,  the  productivity  gains  from  ser-
vices  liberalization  would  be  substantial.  Elec-
tricity,  finance,  telecommunications,  and  trade 
have a direct impact on production and trans-
action costs, making downstream sectors more 
competitive. By boosting job creation and rais-
ing  labor  earnings,  these  productivity  gains 
should  also  lead  to  improved  living  standards. 
Social  impacts  can  be  more  mixed.  They  are 
clearly positive when cell phones connect people 
(especially the poor) to markets for their prod-
ucts,  to  employment  opportunities,  or  to  gov-
ernment  services.  They  can  be  negative  when 
the  disappearance  of  retail  trade  leads  to  the 
decline of traditional urban areas and affects the 
livelihoods of older shopkeepers who may not 
find alternative employment easily.

An  adequate  sequencing  of  services  liberal-
ization and domestic regulation can help man-
age these tradeoffs and, in doing so, address the 
concerns of developing countries. For instance, 
in  telecommunications,  enhanced  domestic 
competition improves welfare more than hand-
ing over existing providers to better-performing 
foreign operators. Evidence from 86 developing 
countries between 1985 and 1999 suggests that 
both  competition  and  liberalization  can  inde-
pendently  improve  performance.  But  penetra-
tion of telecommunications services, measured 
by  main-line  access,  is  lower  if  competition  is 
introduced  after  liberalization,  rather  than  at 
the same time.103 

A  careful  design  of  liberalization,  can  also 
cushion social impacts. For instance, in its pref-
erential trade agreement with the United States, 
Oman chose a sequential approach for the lib-
eralization of its retail trade. Foreign nationals 
were initially permitted to own up to 100 per-
cent  of  the  equity  in  established  retail  enter-
prises valued at more than US$5 million, with 
the  threshold  subsequently  declining  to  US$1 
million.  This  agreement  allowed  for  gradual 
adjustment.  At  the  same  time,  it  was  gener-
ous in relation to foreign ownership, which is 
restricted  to  49  percent  in  Oman’s  prevailing 
multilateral  agreements.104  Similarly,  concerns 
about  the  impact  of  liberalization  on  urban 
centers are addressed through land-zoning re-
strictions, as some industrial countries do. But 
these restrictions can also be used as entry de-

terrents, reducing competition and undermin-
ing job creation.105

The limited traction in services liberalization 
is due largely to the potential tradeoffs involved. 
Developing  countries  may  lack  knowledge  on 
the gains from opening markets, the on precon-
ditions for realizing such gains in light of existing 
tradeoffs, and on the policy options available for 
maximizing  the  gains  and  handling  the  trade-
offs. Similar to the case of trade in goods, many 
countries also lack the ability to implement poli-
cies  and  agreements.  International  collabora-
tion is thus needed to address such knowledge 
gaps and facilitate implementation.106

International agreements can also be used to 
promote global public goods. One case in point 
is gender equality. Trade is not gender neutral. Its 
liberalization, including services trade, changes 
women’s access to jobs. Traditionally men were 
more  likely  to  have  “brawn  jobs,”  involving 
stronger physical requirements. But “brain jobs” 
involving  dexterity,  attention,  or  communica-
tion—from  stitching  garments  to  processing 
data—present  more  opportunities  for  women. 
In Delhi and Mumbai, call centers employ more 

than  1  million  people,  most  of  them  women. 
Preferential  access  for  developing  country  im-
ports from sectors with more “brain jobs” can 
thus  be  used  to  create  employment  opportu-
nities  for  women  in  countries  where  gender 
equality is far from being attained.107 However, 
as countries move up the ladder of global value 
chains, women may also lose job opportunities. 
This was the case in Malaysia, where the share of 
women  working  in  manufacturing  declined  in 
the mid-1980s.108

Migration policies: Toward bilateral 
agreements

Movements of people across borders have elic-
ited diverse policy reactions by recipient coun-
tries over the course of history. These have in-
cluded physical walls that keep foreigners away, 
policies  preventing  forced  and  bonded  labor 
across  oceans,  and  policies  of  open  migration. 
In  addition,  there  has  been  a  range  of  specific 
measures including amnesties for irregular mi-
grants,  statutes  controlling  entry  by  refugees, 
and complex systems for granting visas. In most 

310 

  WO R L D   D E V E LO P M E N T   R E P O RT   2 0 1 3

cases, these policies have been introduced uni-
laterally  by  the  recipient  country  and  have  in-
volved little or no international dialogue or co-
operation with sending countries.

In  contrast  to  the  movement  of  goods  and 
services across borders, few international agree-
ments concern migration in general and migra-
tion of workers in particular. Those in existence 
have limited coverage. ILO Conventions 97 and 
143, in force since 1952 and 1978, respectively, 
seek  to  protect  migrants  from  discrimination 
and abuse, and call for penalties and sanctions 
against those who promote clandestine or ille-
gal migration. But these conventions have been 
ratified by only 49 and 23 countries, respectively. 
Mode 4 of GATS covers exports of services con-
ducted  through  individuals  present  in  another 
WTO member country.109 It entered into force 
in 1995 and covers all signatories to the WTO, 
but only a limited number of services have been 
liberalized  by  either  developed  or  developing 
countries, with very few moving ahead in sensi-
tive areas like health services. Finally, the United 
Nations International Convention on the rights 
of  all  migrant  workers  and  members  of  their 
families aims to “contribute to the harmoniza-
tion of the attitudes of States through the accep-
tance  of  basic  principles  concerning  the  treat-
ment of migrant workers and members of their 
families.” This convention entered into force in 
2003 but has been ratified by only 22 countries, 
mostly sending countries. 

Growing differences in ages, incomes, skills 
and economic perspectives between countries 
are likely to create mounting pressures for mi-
gration. Despite the interest of both industrial 
and  developing  countries  in  “talent”  migra-
tion,  low-skill  migrants  will  still  account  for 
the bulk of cross-border flows in the years to 
come.110  But  readiness  to  make  the  most  of 
these  growing  differences  between  countries, 
and manage migration in a mutually beneficial 
way, is limited. Multicountry agreements have 
been slow to develop. Bilateral agreements that 
take into consideration geographical and his-
torical trends, protect basic rights of workers, 
and take into account the social impacts of mi-
gration,  could  benefit  both  host  and  sending 
countries.

Migration is an area where a global perspec-
tive  is  warranted,  but  views  on  what  needs  to 
be done are quite diverse. One view focuses on 

the  large  earnings  differentials  between  coun-
tries,  suggesting  that  the  free  movement  of  la-
bor would accelerate global productivity growth 
and poverty reduction enormously.111 Another 
perspective  focuses  on  national  security  and 
the  protection  of  communities  and  their  cul-
tures, implying the need for barriers to contain 
 migration.  Yet  another  highlights  the  moral 
imperative to protect the human rights of mi-
grants, no matter their legal status, and to give 
shelter to those who suffer any form of perse-
cution.112 None of these views suffices, because 
none  of  them  alone  can  address  the  complex 
tradeoffs that migration poses for policy design.
There are many examples of such tradeoffs. 
The more that is spent in protecting the welfare 
of migrants, which sending countries and con-
cerned  citizens  everywhere  demand,  the  more 
expensive the use of migrant labor will become, 
and the fewer the number of workers who will 
be  hired.  The  more  that  is  done  to  assimilate 
and  integrate  the  migrants,  which  some  host- 
country  groups  favor,  the  less  likely  migrants 
will be to return to their home countries. The 
more  active  the  policies  to  attract “talent”  mi-
grants,  the  greater  the  “brain  drain”  concerns 
among sending countries. The higher the pro-
tection of sectors such as agriculture by indus-
trial  countries,  the  more  likely  are  migrants 
from  developing  countries  to  work  in  those 
sectors.  Conditioning  foreign  aid  on  banning 
migration seems unacceptable and would affect 
fundamental rights of workers by constraining 
their  freedom  to  move.  Stern  visa  restrictions 
and deportations usually backfire and may turn 
overstayers into irregular migrants. These exam-
ples indicate that unilateral policies cannot ad-
dress all these dilemmas. However, the adoption 
of  global  agreements  setting  the  conditions  of 
migration and superseding country legislation, 
seems unlikely. This is why an intermediate so-
lution can be more effective.

In  many  instances,  both  sending  and  host 
countries  can  benefit  from  migration  through 
a  collaborative  approach.  Most  abuses  perpe-
trated  by  traffickers,  firms,  or  workers  are  as-
sociated  with  illegal  migrant  flows.  The  for-
malization  of  these  flows  is  a  basic  tool  for 
protecting the rights of migrant workers, while 
at the same time having them honor the terms 
under which they were welcomed. This formal-
ization, however, is difficult to enforce without

the cooperation of institutions in both sending 
and receiving countries.113 Bilateral agreements 
can include provisions regarding quotas by oc-
cupation, industry, region, and duration of stay. 
They can distinguish between temporary move-
ments  of  workers  and  steps  to  permanent  mi-
gration, with conditions and protocols for mov-
ing from one country to another and regulation 
of  recruitment  agencies  and  intermediaries. 
They can include considerations about taxation 
and social security, including on benefits to be 
provided, portability of contributions, and cost-
sharing  arrangements.  These  agreements  can 
design incentives so that firms, worker associa-
tions, and governments in both sending and re-
ceiving  countries  have  an  interest  in  enforcing 
the provisions.114

Formalizing  and  extending  temporary  mi-
gration  agreements  could  capture  part  of  the 
wage gain from migration that is currently ab-
sorbed by intermediaries, to the benefit of both 
migrants  and  their  employers.  Agreements  in 
the financial sector could lower the cost of re-
mittances to migrants and avoid the prevalence 
of illegal transactions. Reconsidering the financ-
ing of higher education in both developing and 
developed  countries  could  favor  a  more  bal-
anced sharing of the returns to investments in 
the case of talent migrants. More generally, bi-
lateral coordination is a sensible way to manage 
migration and ensure mutual benefits for send-
ing and recipient countries.

Jobs are center stage, but where are 
the numbers?

Policies for jobs need to be based on reliable data 
and rigorous analysis.115 Given that a large share 
of the people at work in developing countries are 
not wage employees, and that even a larger share 
lacks social security coverage, the measurement 
of employment must look beyond whatever for-
mal employment data the country gathers. De-
termining which jobs have the greatest payoffs 
for poverty reduction requires linking informa-
tion on a household’s income or consumption 
with  information  on  the  employment  of  its 
members.  Understanding  which  firms  create 
more jobs, or whether labor reallocation leads to 
substantial growth rather than just churning, re-
quires information on the inputs and outputs of 

very diverse production units, including micro-
enterprises. Assessing whether employment ex-
periences affect trust and willingness to engage 
in  society  requires  information  on  individual 
values and behaviors. Such information is nec-
essary to tackle an emerging research agenda on 
jobs and development (box 9.4).

However,  the  paucity  of  empirical  analyses 
on the employment impact of the global crisis 
in  developing  countries  and  the  difficulty  of 
comparing  measures  of  informal  employment 
across  countries  suggest  that  data  quality  and 
availability  are  limited.  Much  effort  goes  into 
measuring  unemployment  rates,  even  with  a 
relatively  high  frequency.116  But  open  unem-
ployment is not a very telling indicator in coun-
tries  where  an  important  fraction  of  the  labor 
force is not salaried. Four indicators are listed to 
monitor  progress  toward  the  employment  tar-
get  under  the  Millennium  Development  Goal 
(MDG) on eradicating poverty. This target calls 
for “achieving full and productive employment 
and decent work for all, including women and 
young  people.”  But  the  four  indicators  con-
sidered  only  partially  capture  advances  in  the 
quantity  and  quality  of  jobs  in  the  developing 
world.117  Many  available  employment  figures 
are actually inferred through interpolation be-
tween years and extrapolation using data from 
“similar”  countries,  but  how  reliable  these 
methods are remains an open question.

These  remarks  are  not  meant  to  criticize 
statistical  agencies  at  the  country  level  or  data 
collection efforts at the international level. Their 
efforts are filling important gaps and mobilizing 
expertise  to  improve  definitions,  reach  agree-
ments on best practices, and provide technical 
assistance  to  those  generating  primary  data.118 
Despite  the  limitations,  data  on  informal  em-
ployment, the unemployment rate, or the MDG 
employment  target  serve  an  important  objec-
tive,  namely,  increasing  awareness  on  the  im-
portance  of  jobs  for  promoting  development. 
However,  moving  jobs  center  stage  could  re-
main  an  aspirational  statement  in  the  absence 
of a sustained effort to improve the amount and 
comparability of data.

Today’s  challenges  regarding  labor  statistics 
can be regrouped into three key areas: data gaps; 
data quality issues; and planning, coordination, 
and communication issues. In some countries, 
labor statistics do not exist at all or are collected

BOX 9.4    Knowledge gaps on jobs and development chart the research agenda

Increased reliance on disaggregated survey data, together with rig-
orous program evaluation and controlled experiments, has pushed 
the knowledge frontier on jobs and development in recent years. 
On almost all relevant issues a substantive body of evidence already 
exists. Current efforts of the research community promise its expan-
sion in the coming years, in ways that should contribute to better 
informed policy making. However, knowledge gaps remain in sev-
eral areas.

Jobs  and  living  standards.  An  abundance  of  high-quality  work 
has been done on the measurement of poverty and the assessment 
of poverty alleviation programs. Less is known on how employment 
dynamics affect household living standards and movements in and 
out of poverty. Research on transitions between different employ-
ment statuses, occupations, industries, and types of jobs can shed 
light on incentives to work and formalize, as well as on impacts of 
jobs  on  household  well-being.  Knowledge  is  also  limited  on  the 
subjective  value  workers  attach  to  various  characteristics  of  their 
jobs, including to social security benefits such as old-age and dis-
ability pensions. 

Jobs and productivity. Many studies are available on firm dynam-
ics, including births, growth, and deaths. There is also a growing lit-
erature  on  the  impacts  of  trade  liberalization  and  foreign  direct 
investment on productivity and earnings at the plant level. Much of 
this  research  focuses  on  formal  sector  firms,  however.  Much  less 
research  is  available  on  the  dynamics  of  micro-  and  small  enter-
prises in the informal sector, despite their importance for employ-
ment.  There  is  also  some  disconnect  between  studies  based  on 
plant-level  surveys  and  the  growing  literature  on  the  effects  of 
urbanization. The dialogue between these different literatures is in 
part  hampered  by  different  visions  of  production  processes  on 
issues such as returns to scale or externalities.

Jobs and social cohesion. Research in this area is tentative and the 
empirical evidence is scarce. The importance of the topic and the 
paucity  of  robust  results  mean  that  the  payoffs  to  high-quality 
research in this area could be very high. Natural experiments com-
bined  with  longitudinal  data  spanning  relatively  long  periods  of 

time may shed light on the links between jobs and behaviors. Inter-
disciplinary research could provide insights on the broader relation-
ship  between 
institutional  development  processes. 
Anthropological  approaches  may  provide  insights  on  the  mecha-
nisms at play; for instance on how jobs affect perceptions on fair-
ness and the willingness to trust others.

jobs  and 

Spillovers  from  jobs.  Research  on  the  magnitude  of  spillovers 
from jobs is patchy. The agenda is long, but a promising area con-
cerns the impact of jobs on the acquisition of cognitive and noncog-
nitive skills, and how this impact varies depending on the character-
istics of the job and those of the person who holds it. Evidence on 
agglomeration effects across cities with different characteristics is 
also scarce, as are estimates of the environmental impacts of differ-
ent types of jobs.

Labor policies. A growing number of empirical studies focus on 
the  impact  of  labor  policies  and  institutions,  and  many  of  these 
studies are very rigorous. However, a careful review suggests that 
the relationship between policies and institutions on the one hand, 
and outcomes on the other, is not linear. Rather, it evokes a “plateau” 
of modest effects, but with “cliffs” at both ends where the impacts 
on efficiency and the distribution of jobs can be sizeable. Empirical 
work  to  determine  where  these  cliffs  lie  and  how  to  identify  the 
institutional characteristics that demarcate the limits of the plateau 
would be of much value for policy makers.

Connected jobs agendas. More research is needed on how inter-
national  trade,  investment  at  both  ends,  and  migration  affect  the 
composition of employment across countries. Knowledge gaps are 
common  in  all  of  these  areas.  The  ability  of  national  policies  and 
supranational mechanisms such as trade agreements to affect jobs 
in different countries is only partially understood. More solid knowl-
edge  on  the  right  sequencing  of  international  commitments  and 
domestic policies related to services could address the reluctance of 
developing countries to make further progress in the direction of 
liberalization. Rigorous evaluations of migration policies would also 
be helpful.

only  sporadically.  Where  labor  statistics  do  
exist, data quality is a concern throughout the 
statistical production chain, from the use of ap-
propriate  definitions  to  questionnaire  design, 
from sampling frames to interviewing protocols, 
and from data entry and coding to verification 
and estimation procedures. Planning, coordina-
tion, and communication issues are exacerbated 
when  different  institutions  are  responsible  for 
collecting  and  disseminating  the  data.119  The 
most  urgent  priorities  are  to  standardize  the 
employment  modules  attached  to  the  house-
hold  surveys  used  for  poverty  analysis,  and  to 

ensure that establishment surveys include infor-
mal firms and microenterprises.

A quarter of a century ago, a renewed empha-
sis on poverty reduction as the key objective of 
development policy launched a long-term data 
effort. Across the world, information on house-
hold  living  standards  was  collected  through 
standardized  surveys,  the  sampling  methods 
and the variable definitions used were duly doc-
umented, and the data and documentation were 
made available to researchers and practitioners 
whenever  possible.  A  similar  approach  should 
be envisioned to move jobs center stage.

How to accelerate labor reallocation?

Beyond labor policies   

313

Creative destruction, the mainstay of economic 
growth,  happens  to  a  large  extent  through  la-
bor  reallocation.  As  workers  move  from  jobs 
in  low-productivity  farms  and  obsolete  firms 
to jobs in more dynamic economic units, out-
put  increases  and  the  economy  moves  closer 
to  the  efficiency  frontier.  Differences  in  pro-
ductivity  across  economic  units  underlie  this 
creative  destruction  process.  Such  differences 
can reflect a healthy ecosystem driven by com-
petition  which  offers  the  basis  for  efficiency- 
enhancing  job  reallocation.  Market  imperfec-
tions and government failures may hinder labor 
reallocation,  however,  resulting  in  a  wider  dis-
persion  of  productivity  and  many  missed  op-
portunities for growth.120

Stringent regulations that obstruct the move-
ment of workers from low- to high-productivity  
areas or that prevent their separation from ob-
solete  firms  are  a  case  in  point.  These  regula-
tions  may  stem  from  good  intentions,  such  as 
containing  congestion  in  cities  or  providing 
earnings  stability  to  workers.  But  their  cost  in 
productivity  growth  can  be  substantial.  Regu-
lations of this kind do not sit on the efficiency 
“plateau” where labor policies are mainly redis-
tributive; they are rather on the cliff, and have 
unambiguously  negative  effects  on  economic 
efficiency.

India  is  arguably  an  example  of  a  country 
whose complex and cumbersome labor policies 
have pushed it off the “plateau.” The country has 
more than 40 national and state-level labor laws. 
Most of them apply to the organized (or formal) 
sector and to firms above a certain size. As firms’ 
employment increases, they fall under the pur-
view of a growing number of regulations.121 The 
Industrial Disputes Act (IDA) of 1947 is particu-
larly  restrictive.  Governing  employee-employer 
relationships, the IDA makes it extremely diffi-
cult for firms to terminate employment.122

The  stringency  of  labor  regulations  is  con-
sistent with the “missing middle” phenomenon, 
characteristic  of  India  and  other  developing 
countries, where medium-size businesses make 
up  a  disproportionately  small  share  of  the  to-
tal.  Also  consistent  with  the  stringency  of  la-
bor regulations is the substantial dispersion of 

productivity. If  the  dispersion  observed  within 
each industry narrowed to the point of match-
ing the dispersion observed in the United States, 
India’s  average  productivity  in  manufacturing 
could increase by more than half.123 Instead, de-
spite  India’s  buoyant  economic  growth  during 
the  past  two  decades,  the  performance  of  the 
labor-intensive  manufacturing  sector  has  been 
sluggish.124 The bulk of the growth in nonfarm 
employment has been in the informal sector.

The  conventional  wisdom,  when  a  country  
is riddled with misguided labor regulations, is 
to repeal them. This repeal may be easier said 
than done, however. India’s complex labor reg-
ulatory  system  has  been  in  place  for  60  years; 
even  the  ambitious  reform  program  triggered 
by  the  balance-of-payment  crisis  of  1991  left 
 labor regulations largely untouched.125 The IDA 
of 1947 has been amended at the state level but 
not  always  toward  the  plateau.  Between  1958 
and 1992, seven states amended the IDA to give 
employers  more  latitude  in  labor  decisions. 
These  states  subsequently  experienced  higher 
growth  in  output,  employment,  investment, 
and  productivity  in  their  formal  manufactur-
ing sector. But six other states changed the IDA 
in  the  opposite  direction,  which  resulted  in  a 
worsening in firm performance and an expan-
sion of the informal sector.126 Overall, the dis-
persion of productivity in India’s manufactur-
ing  sector  remained  stable,  or  even  increased, 
between 1987 and 1994.127

From bypassing regulatory obstacles . . .

India’s response to these regulatory obstacles has 
been to learn how to live with them, and this has 
been achieved through widespread noncompli-
ance.128 For example, large firms rely on con-
tractors,  who  in  turn  hire  workers;  thus  total 
employment  is  “sliced”  into  smaller  packages, 
each escaping the most stringent labor market 
regulations.  Short-term  contracts  and  tempo-
rary  employment  agencies  are  other  mecha-
nisms used to circumvent the regulations. The 
propensity of firms to hire contract workers has 
increased over time for all firms employing 10 
or more workers and is highest among medium-

sized firms (50–99 workers).129 A 10-year study 
of 1,300 firms also finds insignificant differences 
between medium and larger firms in their hir-
ing of manual workers.130 The share of informal 
workers in total employment in organized firms 
grew from 32 percent in 2000 to 52 percent in 
2005 to 68 percent in 2010.131 

Consistent  with  noncompliance,  the  distri-
bution of firms by size does not show substan-
tial  discontinuities  around  the  threshold  levels 
where regulations become more stringent. Con-
sidering the entire distribution, including infor-
mal firms, the biggest discontinuity is between 
firms employing up to 4 workers and those em-
ploying 5 to 10 (figure 9.8a). However, there is 
no  5-worker  threshold  in  the  applicable  labor 
market regulations. On the other hand, there is 
no discontinuity in the distribution when cross-
ing the 50-worker cutoff point, despite it being 
the threshold above which firms fall under the 
purview of the IDA (figure 9.8b).

Admittedly,  other  factors  could  influence  
India’s distribution of firms by size.132 But over-
all, these patterns are consistent with firms by-
passing labor regulations.

. . . to actively offsetting them . . .

While India has learned how to live with cum-
bersome regulatory obstacles, other developing 
countries with similar constraints have accom-
plished more efficiency-enhancing labor reallo-
cation. Sri Lanka inherited the same labor regu-
lations from the British colonial administration 
as India did. Without reaching the extremes in 
India, many Latin American countries face sim-
ilar regulatory obstacles. Although China’s labor 
regulations were less stringent until the 1990s, 
its household registration (hukou) system rep-
resented the ultimate obstacle to labor realloca-
tion.133 Yet, all of these countries have managed 
to spur growth in high-productivity sectors and 
locations.

Sri  Lanka  gradually  liberalized  many  of  its 
markets during the 1980s and 1990s but did not 
reform its complicated and costly employment 
protection  legislation.  Under  the  Termination 
of  Employment  of  Workman  Act  (TEWA)  of 
1971, firms with 15 or more employees cannot 
lay  off  workers  without  official  authorization 
and are liable for termination payments of up 
to  four  years  of  salary,  depending  on  the  em-

ployee’s length of service. Yet the country’s gar-
ment  industry  was  a  runaway  success.  Replac-
ing tea as the country’s major source of export 
revenue, the industry now accounts for half of 
Sri Lanka’s sales abroad, up from almost noth-
ing  in  the  1970s.  It  also  accounts  for  much  of  
the  increase  in  employment  in  manufactur-
ing.134 The success of the garment industry has 
been a magnet for rural migrants, with 45 per-
cent of them moving to the western provinces 
where the garment industry is concentrated.

Restrictive  labor  market  regulations  are 
a  common  feature  of  many  Latin  American 
countries too. In Brazil, after years of economic 
reforms,  hiring  workers  remains  as  burden-
some as ever. If anything, the sustained increase 
in formalization over the past decade has made 
compliance with labor regulations more com-
mon. Yet, Brazil’s labor market has been char-
acterized  by  massive  internal  migration  and 
remarkably high labor turnover rates. Lifetime 
interstate  migration  is  estimated  to  have  dou-
bled  between  the  1980s  and  the  1990s,  reach-
ing two-fifths of the population by 1999. In the 
1990s,  one-third  of  the  workers  who  changed 
jobs  in  Brazil’s  formal  sector  had  migrated 

across  state  borders  to  find  employment. And 
an  estimated  two-fifths  to  one-half  of  formal 
sector workers change jobs every year.135

Nowhere  is  the  extent  of  labor  reallocation 
more  striking  than  in  China,  and  much  of  it 
happened under the hukou system. Since its in-
troduction  in  the  1950s,  this  system  governed 
where  people  could  live,  effectively  preventing 
rural-to-urban  labor  flows  and  reserving  em-
ployment in cities for their residents (box 9.5). 
With market-oriented reforms, the system was 
gradually liberalized, and many restrictions on 
internal  migration  were  lifted.  But  the  hukou 
system has not been completely abolished; even 
today it may still inhibit migrant flows and re-
duce  the  incidence  of  workers  moving  with 
dependents. Despite this barrier to labor mobil-
ity,  China  experienced  phenomenal  growth  in 
labor-intensive  manufacturing,  involving  mas-
sive  internal  migration  from  the  hinterland  to 
coastal  areas,  and  from  villages  to  towns  and 
urban centers. This geographically concentrated 
development  absorbed  an  important  share  of 
rural surplus labor, while integrating China into 
international  value  chains  and  making  it  the 
“world’s factory.”136

BOX 9.5    China’s hukou system has been partially liberalized

A hukou is analogous to an internal passport. Legal residency in a 
city, town, or village is determined by an individual’s birth place. 
Rural and urban populations are registered separately. The hukou 
system regulates many social entitlements of citizens, including 
education,  housing,  utilities  subsidies,  and  social  protection. 
Together with other policies such as urban food rationing during 
the  period  under  central  planning  the  hukou  system  prevented 
the rural labor force from moving out of agriculture. It maintained 
an  exclusive  urban  labor  market  with  basic  social  welfare,  and 
supported 
industrial  policy,  effectively  creating  rural-urban 
segmentation. 

At the beginning of the reform process, cities and towns could 
afford basic social welfare only for a limited population. Inflows of 
rural  workers  were  therefore  seen  as  a  double-edged  sword  that 
could increase the well-being of rural residents but also lead to con-
gestion  and  overcrowded  infrastructure.  After  reforms  in  urban 
areas were under way in the mid-1980s, and the growth of township 
and village enterprises stagnated, farmers were allowed to work in 
small and medium cities—but only on the condition that they con-
tinued to be self-sufficient in terms of staples, in accordance with 

the food ration scheme that was still in force. Restrictions were not 
lifted  until  the  mid-1990s,  when  reforms  were  well  under  way.  By 
then, the fast growth of labor-intensive and export-oriented sectors 
and  the  dramatic  surge  of  private  sector  activities  in  urban  areas 
generated a substantial demand for low-skilled labor. Only at that 
point was the hukou system substantially liberalized.

The implementation of this liberalization process has been con-
ducted in a decentralized way. Most medium and large cities have 
gradually lowered the criteria for migrants to change hukou identi-
ties, and hence their accompanying entitlements. However, the cri-
teria remain exceptionally strict in major cities and in cities with high 
income  levels,  including  Shanghai,  Beijing,  and  Guangzhou.  For 
example, Shanghai was the first city to make the residence permit 
system  open  to  all,  but  its  qualifying  conditions  are  among  the 
strictest. Shanghai’s system favors immigrants with college degrees 
or  special  talents,  and  those  who  do  business  or  invest.  It  also 
requires seven years of social insurance contributions before apply-
ing. In addition, the city has a tight overall quota on hukou conver-
sions, and the actual number of conversions has to date been very 
low.

. . . through productivity spillovers
These examples point to a successful second-best 
approach to offset regulatory obstacles. Instead 
of  trying  to  avoid  or  evade  labor  regulations, 
this approach involves actively taking advantage 
of productivity spillovers from jobs in industrial 
clusters, dynamic cities, or global value chains to 
make the regulations less relevant in practice. 

In  Sri  Lanka,  the  development  of  export 
processing  zones  (EPZs)  drove  the  takeoff  of 
the garment industry. These economic enclaves 
offered better infrastructure and a more favor-
able regulatory environment than the rest of the 
economy. As a result, they attracted large inflows 
of FDI and became the source of a large fraction 
of Sri Lanka’s exports (figure 9.9).137 Local pro-
ducers in these zones were able to benefit from 
cluster  effects.  Outperforming  competitors  in 
many other developing countries, the industry 
has managed to move up the value chain, trans-
forming factories into design centers.

In  Brazil,  the  surge  of  internal  migration  is 
closely  associated  with  the  country’s  continu-
ing integration into the global economy and a 
development  policy  that  favors  agglomeration 
effects. In the 1990s, Brazil implemented major 
trade liberalization measures, gradually relaxed 
restrictions on FDI, and devalued its currency. 
In this context, development policy was increas-

ingly  left  to  subnational  governments,  empha-
sizing the importance of regional hubs and fa-
cilitating a location-specific policy agenda built 
on local strengths. These efforts supported the 
relocation of industries toward previously less-
favored regions. While local policies were largely 
targeted  at  fostering  small  and  medium  firms, 
they  also  attracted  bigger  firms  and  multi-
national  companies.  The  impact  on  internal 
migration was significant. A 1 percent increase 
in the concentration of FDI in a particular loca-
tion was associated with a 0.2 percent increase 
in the location’s immigration rate. And a 1 per-
cent  increase  in  employment  in  export  sectors 
was associated with a 0.3 percent reduction in 
outmigration.138

In China, labor reallocation is rooted in the 
development of competitive cities. The urban 
share  of  the  population  jumped  from  just  27 
percent in 1990 to almost 50 percent in 2010. 
This transformation is unprecedented, with the 
urban population increasing from 170 million 
in 1978 to 456 million in 2000 and 665 million 
today.  The  increase  was  supported  through  a 
phenomenal  expansion  of  commercial  power 
supply,  urban  infrastructure,  highways,  and 
ports. In 1988, China had barely 100 kilometers 
of expressways; 10 years later, the total length

was second to the United States; and by 2009, 
more than 60,000 kilometers were in use.139

Regional  competition  and  experimentation 
in part underpin these successes. In China, lo-
cal governments have substantial autonomy to 
raise  fiscal  and  nonfiscal  resources.  They  thus 
have  considerable  scope  to  take  responsibility 
for  local  development.  The  Chinese  Commu-
nist  Party  also  rewards  local  officials  based  on 
local performance, prompting them to actively 
engage in economic competition.140 

This  decentralized  institutional  setting  al-
lowed  cities  in  China  to  experiment  with  re-
forms to the hukou system as a tool for urban-
ization. It has been argued that a large fraction  
of cities in China are too small because of it.141 
But  the  decentralized  implementation  of  the 
 system  allowed  major  globalizing  cities  to  use 
the  hukou  system  as  a  screening  tool  to  select 
more skilled migrants and enhance the produc-
tivity  spillovers  from  jobs.  Most  medium  and 
large cities have gradually eased the criteria for 
migrants  to  change  hukou  identities.  However, 
bigger  and  richer  globalizing  cities  have  em-
braced a more skill-intensive pattern of growth, 
putting  more  weight  on  productivity  growth 
than on poverty reduction (figure 9.10).142 Ac-

cordingly, the criteria for changing hukou iden-
tities  in  these  cities  are  generally  defined  by 
skills,  investments,  income,  and  residence  re-
quirements. The numbers of migrants meeting 
these criteria have been small.143

Back to India, then, where the slow pace of 
urbanization  is  even  more  striking  than  the 
 rigidity  of  its  labor  regulations.  In  1990,  the 
share of India’s population living in cities was 
the  same  as  China’s:  27  percent.  Two  decades 
later,  it  had  grown  only  to  30  percent.144  The 
functionality  of  the  cities  also  poses  severe 
challenges. For instance, large swaths of Delhi 
or Mumbai have access to no more than four 
to  five  hours  of  water  supply  a  day.  Energy 
shortfalls have increased in recent years and are 
perceived as the top constraint for doing busi-
ness.  A  company  can  expect  17  power  shut-
downs  a  month.  The  cost  imposed  on  firms 
by the power problem is among the highest in 
the  world.145  Judging  from  the  experiences  of 
Brazil, China, and Sri Lanka, and after 60 years 
of partial success in making labor regulations 
more  flexible,  the  key  for  India  to  accelerate 
labor reallocation and thereby realize its devel-
opment  potential  may  lie  in  its  urbanization 
policy.

country to finance a substantial countercyclical 
expansion of expenditures.

Beyond labor policies

116.  Around  the  world,  65  countries  produce 
monthly  or  quarterly  labor  force  surveys, 
whereas 116 produce annual surveys.

117.  The four indicators are GDP per employed per-
son (a measure of productivity), the employment- 
to-population  rate,  the  proportion  of  the  em-
ployed population living on less than US$1.25 
per day (the so-called working poor), and the 
proportion  of  own-account  and  unremuner-
ated  workers  in  employed  population  (also 
called vulnerable workers). United Nations De-
velopment Group 2010.

118.  International standards on labor statistics are of 
two  types:  those  outlined  in  Conventions  and 
Recommendations adopted by the ILO Interna-
tional Labour Conference, and the Resolutions 
and  Guidelines  adopted  by  the  International 
Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS). The 
first  type  of  standards  is  part  of  the  interna-
tional labor code and is legally binding in rati-
fying countries, whereas standards adopted by 
the  ICLS  are  intended  to  provide  guidance  to 
countries,  promote  international  comparabil-
ity of labor statistics, and encourage coherence 
in  concepts  and  methods  across  sources  and 
domains.

World Development Report 2013; Pagés 2010.

121.  For example, once employment in a firm using 
power reaches 10 workers (20 for firms that do 
not  use  power),  the  firm  enters  the  organized 
sector and becomes subject to the Factories Act 
of 1948. Once it reaches 50 workers, it is subject 
to the IDA of 1947 and must offer mandatory 
health insurance under the Employee State In-
surance Act of 1948. Once it reaches 100 work-
ers,  it  effectively  loses  the  rights  to  terminate 
workers.

123.  Hsieh and Klenow 2009.
124.  Panagariya  2008.  The  entire  decline  in  the 
share  of  agriculture  since  1990–91  has  been 
absorbed by services. Agriculture as a share of 
GDP fell from 46 percent in 1970–71 to 27 per-
cent in 1990–91 and to 21 percent in 2004–05; 
industry’s  share  of  GDP  rose  from  22  percent 
in  1970–71  to  27  percent  in  1990–91  and  re-
mained  at  the  same  level  through  2004–05; 
the share of manufacturing, consequently, rose 
from  13  percent  in  1970–71  to  17  percent  in 
1990–91 through 2004–05.

125.  The reforms focus on the liberalization of trade 
and foreign investment and the dismantling of 
the  License  Raj  system  introduced  in  1951  to 

impose central control over entry and produc-
tion in the organized manufacturing sector.

and  Burgess  (2004)  because  of  the  interpreta-
tion and enforcement of the amendments to the 
IDA of 1947.

133.  Several labor laws have been enacted in China 
since  2000,  including  a  revision  to  the  Trade 
Union  Law  in  2001;  the  Labor  Contract  Law, 
the  Employment  Promotion  Law,  and  the  La-
bor Dispute Mediation and Arbitration Law in 
2008; and the Social Insurance Law in 2011. The 
implementation  of  these  regulations  may  lead 
to lower flexibility in the labor market.

135.  More  interesting,  the  migration  flows  of  for-
mal  sector  workers  were  directed  toward  un-
conventional  destinations:  a  few  states  in  Bra-
zil’s Center-West, North, and Northeast. These 
flows  contradict  the  assertion  that  the  typical 
migrant flow runs from the low-income North 
to  the  higher-income  South.  Aguayo-Tellez,

Glossary

Jobs

Jobs: While precise definitions vary, jobs are labor activities that generate income, monetary or 
in kind, without violating fundamental rights and principles at work. Jobs can take the form of 
wage employment, self-employment, and farming. They can be formal or informal.

Good jobs for development: These are jobs that contribute the most to societal goals. The 
development payoff of a job is the sum of the value it has to the worker and its spillovers (if 
any) on others. The individual value is the first-order measure of the development payoff, but 
spillovers can be substantial.

Jobs lens: Strategies, policies, and programs adopt a jobs lens if they take into account the 
development payoffs from jobs. The jobs lens involves aims at realizing the untapped develop-
ment payoffs by addressing the constraints that prevent the private sector from creating more 
good jobs for development.

skills

Cognitive  skills:  They  include  verbal  ability,  working  memory,  numeracy,  and  problem- 
solving  abilities.  They  are  the  foundation  for  the  acquisition  and  building  of  other  skills 
throughout life.

social  skills:  They  facilitate  interaction  and  communication  with  others.  They  are  based  
on personality traits that underlie behaviors such as teamwork, reliability, discipline, or work 
effort.

Technical skills: They enable the performance of specific tasks. They take the form of knowl-
edge that is specific to a particular occupation or group of occupations.

entrepreneurship: It is the combination of innovative capacity to put new ideas into effect 
with managerial capacity to increase a firm’s efficiency within the limits of known technology.

TransformaTions

Living standards: They encompass the material and subjective aspects of well-being. Jobs con-
tribute to living standards through earnings opportunities that lift people out of poverty, make 
them less vulnerable, motivate them, and contribute to their broader happiness and satisfac-
tion with life.

330 

  WO R L D   D E V E LO P M E N T   R E P O RT   2 0 1 3

productivity: It is the amount of output generated with a given amount of inputs. A higher 
productivity of individual jobs, the creation of more productive jobs and destruction of less 
productive ones, and the reallocation of workers within countries and across borders drive 
changes in aggregate productivity.

social cohesion: Societies are cohesive when they have the capacity to manage collective deci-
sion making peacefully. Jobs can contribute to social cohesion by nurturing trust in others 
beyond the group people belong to. They can also do so by fostering civic engagement.

righTs

Core labor standards: A set of eight International Labour Organization conventions included 
in the 1998 Declaration of the Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. These conven-
tions cover child labor, discrimination, forced labor, and freedom of association and collective 
bargaining.

Health and safety at work: Occupational accidents and work-related diseases can undermine 
workers’ health, are an important source of mortality, and can have high costs to society.

DevelopmenT payoffs

spillovers: Beyond their direct impact on the well-being of the people who hold them, jobs 
can have additional impacts on societal goals. Jobs may influence the living standards of oth-
ers, their productivity, or the way collective decisionmaking works. Spillovers from jobs can be 
positive or negative.

earnings of others: Uneven bargaining power or discrimination may lead to labor earnings 
that are too low or too high, with others gaining or losing as a result. Jobs supported through 
government  transfers  or  restrictive  regulations  also  affect  the  earnings  and  employment  
opportunities of others.

Household allocations: Jobs can change the status of their jobholders and increase their say 
on how resources are allocated among household members. Jobs that empower women can 
lead to greater investments in children’s education and health.

poverty reduction: In societies that value poverty reduction, jobs that take people out of hard-
ship increase overall well-being. In these societies, employment opportunities tilted in favor of 
the poor are seen as preferable, even if aggregate earnings or output do not change.

agglomeration effects: Work-related interactions can increase the productivity of others. The 
sharing of ideas; learning from customers, suppliers and competitors; and a better matching 
of skills across a larger pool of workers are among the mechanisms through which these pro-
ductivity gains take place. 

Global integration: Jobs linked to world markets and jobs in foreign-owned companies al-
low acquiring more advanced technical and managerial skills. These jobs can also change the 
industrial structure in ways that favor the most productive economic units and push the least 
productive out of business.

 

Glossary   

331

environmental effects: Jobs have negative impacts on aggregate productivity when they dam-
age the environment or lead to an overuse of scarce resources. But they can also have positive 
environmental effects, as in the case of jobs to manage forests and other common resources. 

social identity: Jobs can impact the well-being of others by influencing the values and be-
havior of those who hold them in ways that affect society at large. Jobs can shape the norms 
influencing how the jobholder interacts with others.

networks: Jobs connect people to each other. They convey information among coworkers and 
society more broadly. Jobs may also contribute to tolerance when interactions at the workplace 
increase direct knowledge among people of different social and ethnic backgrounds. 

sense of fairness: Job allocations at odds with the idea of equality of opportunity may lead 
to  frustration  and  disengagement  from  society  and  collective  decision-making  processes.  
Jobs that live up to standards of transparency and merit can contribute to the sense of fairness 
in society.

Jobs challenges 

agrarian economies: In these economies most people are still engaged in agriculture, often  
in very small family farms, and cities are not yet a source of economic dynamism. 

Conflict-affected countries: These are countries undergoing or emerging from conflict, where 
peace-keeping forces may still be needed or where deaths from conflict may still be high. 

Resource-rich countries: Minerals account for a large share of exports. Exploitation of re-
sources brings dramatic economic growth but undermines competitiveness and encourages 
jobs based on transfers. 

small island nations: Their size and remoteness make it difficult for them to reap the benefits 
of agglomeration and global integration. Their fragile ecosystems add to their vulnerability. 

Urbanizing  countries:  The  share  of  the  urban  population  is  growing  rapidly.  Cities  are  a  
magnet  for  rural  migrants  but  may  fail  to  move  up  from  exports  of  light  manufacturing  
to higher value added products. 

Countries with high youth unemployment: Prolonged joblessness and idleness affect a large 
share of the often sizeable youth population. The allocation of business opportunities and jobs 
is tainted by privilege.

Formalizing countries: The coverage of social protection systems is large enough to envision 
extending it to the entire workforce, but how to do it without undermining productivity is a 
challenge.

aging societies: The share of the working-age population is declining and the costs of pro-
viding and caring for the growing number of elderly is increasing, putting a double burden on 
living standards.

The World Development Report 2013 team benefited from close collaboration with the 
team preparing the International Finance Corporation’s Jobs Study: “Assessing Private Sec-
tor Contributions to Job Creation,” led by Roland Michelitsch. The team also benefited from 
the interaction with the Jobs Knowledge Platform, which was launched during the prepara-
tion of the report under the guidance of Mary Hallward-Driemeier, Gladys López-Acevedo,  
David Robalino, and Claudia Sepulveda. 

The team also engaged closely with the Implementation Task Force for the Report con-
vened by Mahmoud Mohieldin, led by Tamar Manuelyan Atinc and Arup Banerji, and includ-
ing Omar Arias, Najy Benhassine, Mary Hallward-Driemeier, Roland Michelitsch, Pierella 
Paci, and Idah Pswarayi-Riddihough.

General notes 

Indicators 

Tables  1  to  8  include  68  jobs-related  indica-
tors. These indicators summarize the level and 
composition  of  employment  in  each  country, 
including  not  only  wage  work  but  also  self-
employment and farming. They cover the con-
nections  between  jobs  and  living  standards, 
productivity  and  social  cohesion  and  provide 
measures of migration. Definitions are provided 
in the technical notes.

Sources 

Data  for  37  of  the  68  indicators  in  tables  1  to 
8 are from publicly available sources. The pro-
cess  of  selecting  these  public  sources  favored 
cross-country comparability over country cov-
erage. For a majority of the indicators, there are 
a  range  of  additional  data  sources,  including  
national statistical offices, international reposi-
tories, and specific studies. However, only data 
produced  using  the  same  criteria  in  all  coun-
tries are retained. In most cases, there is a single 
data source for each of these 37 indicators. For 
instance,  the  five  unemployment  indicators  in 
tables 1 and 6 are entirely based on the Key In-
dicators of the Labor Market (KILM) database 
of the International Labour Organization (ILO).
Educational  attainment  in  table  2  is  an  in-
dicator that draws on two sources using differ-
ent  criteria:  the  Programme  for  International 
Student  Assessment  (PISA)  and  the  Trends  in 
International  Mathematics  and  Science  Study 
(TIMSS). These sources are jointly available for 
six countries only, which allows reporting them 
both without much overlap. The specific source 
used in each case is noted in table 2.

The other 31 indicators in tables 1 to 8 are 
based,  totally  or  partially,  on  micro-data  pro-
cessed by the World Development Report 2013 
team.  The  indicators  entirely  based  on  the  
team’s  data  processing  refer  to  skills  as  a  con-
straint  (table  2),  the  working  poor  (table  4),  
the gender gap in earnings (table 4), workers in 
micro-enterprises  (table  5),  wage  inequality 
(table  6),  and  youth  not  in  school  or  at  work 
(table 6). In all other cases, data for Organisa-
tion for Economic Co-operation and Develop-
ment (OECD) member countries, other indus-
trial countries, and European Union accession 

countries,  are  from  the  OECD  and  Eurostat 
websites. For developing countries, the indica-
tors are based on micro-data processed by the 
World Development Report 2013 team, follow-
ing  the  same  criteria  and  definitions  as  the 
OECD and Eurostat websites.

The micro-data underlying these 31 indica-
tors are from a large set of household surveys, 
labor  force  surveys,  population  censuses  and 
enterprise  surveys.  The  World  Development 
Report  2013  team  relied  on  four  large-scale 
micro-data repositories: the World Bank’s Inter-
national Income Distribution Database (I2D2), 
Eurostat,  the  Minnesota  Population  Center’s 
Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS 
International, version 6.1), and the World Bank 
enterprise surveys database. The team also gath-
ered many additional living standards and labor 
force surveys.

To be considered as a micro-data source for 
any of the 31 indicators, living standards sur-
veys or labor force surveys have to be nationally 
representative. For highly urbanized countries, 
this  requirement  implies  that  surveys  cover 
secondary cities and towns; for other countries, 
they also have to include rural areas. In all, more  
than  800  household  surveys  and  censuses— 
including  data  on  more  than  600  million  
people—were  standardized  by  the World  De-
velopment  Report  2013  team  to  ensure  the 
comparability of data across countries. Table 9 
summarizes the source of information for the 
indicators  that  are  based  on  micro-data.  Fur-
ther information on sources is provided in the 
technical notes. 

Years 

Data in tables 1 to 8 generally covers three years: 
1995, 2005, and 2010. In a few cases, other years 
had to be retained due to data availability For ex-
ample, the most recent estimate of wages by oc-
cupation (in table 4) is for 2008, and the first set 
of comparable observations for minimum wages 
(in table 7) is for 2007. Similarly, data on edu-
cational  attainment  (table  2)  are  presented  for 
2003, 2006, and 2009, as these are the points in 
time for which PISA data are available (TIMSS 
data labeled as 2006 are actually for 2007).

For  the  31  indicators  computed  using  mi-
cro-data processed by the World Development 
Report  2013  team,  1995,  2005,  and  2010  are 

 

Selected Indicators

reference  points.  The  micro-data  sources  used 
are  seldom  available  on  an  annual  basis.  For 
these  indicators,  data  are  for  the  nearest  point 
within a five-year window. For example, figures 
reported for 1995 are from the closest year over 
the period 1993–97. The precise year of the sur-
vey data varies from country to country.

Unless otherwise noted, data for China do not 
include data for Hong Kong SAR, China; Macao 
SAR, China; or Taiwan, China. Data for Indone-
sia include Timor Leste through 1999. Data for 
Serbia  include  Montenegro  through  2005,  and 
exclude Kosovo from 1999 onwards. 

Symbols 

Countries 

Tables  1  to  8  include  156  countries  or  econo-
mies. The word country may refer to any terri-
tory for which separate social or economic sta-
tistics are available. Data are shown for countries 
and economies as they were constituted in 2010. 

An empty space means that data are not avail-
able, or that the indicator cannot be calculated. 
A “0” or “0.0” means that the value of the indi-
cator is nil or small enough that it would round 
to  zero  at  the  displayed  number  of  decimal 
places.

Technical notes 

Table 1: Labor force

•   Population:  Number  of  people  living  in  the 
territory  of  a  country  or  economy;  in  mil-
lions;  total  and  by  gender  (three  indicators). 
Figures  are  from  population  censuses  and  
demographic  estimates.  Data  source:  World 
Development  Indicators  (WDI),  at  http://
data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL.

•   Working age population: Persons aged 15 to 
64 as a fraction of the population; in percent; 
total  and  by  gender  (three  indicators).  Data 
source: see table 9.

•   Participation rate: Share of the working age 
population that is in the labor force, with the 
labor  force  defined  as  persons  who  work  or 
are  unemployed  during  a  reference  period; 
in percent; total, by gender and by age group 
(five indicators). Data source: see table 9.

•   Unemployment rate: Share of the labor force 
that  is  unemployed,  with  the  unemployed 
defined as persons who are available to work 
and  are  actively  looking  for  a  job  during  a 
reference period; in percent; total and by gen-
der (three indicators). Data source: KILM, at 
http://www.ilo.org/kilm.

Table 2: Skills 

•   Average schooling: Mean of highest complet-
ed level of formal schooling among all persons 
aged 15 and above; in years; total and by gen-
der  (three  indicators).  Figures  are  estimated 
based on data from population censuses. The 
methodology is described by Robert J. Barro 
and Jong-Wha Lee, 2010, “A New Data Set of 
Educational Attainment in the World, 1950–
2010,” NBER Working Papers 15902, National 
Bureau  of  Economic  Research.  Data  source: 
http://www.barrolee.com. 

•   Skills as a constraint:  Share  of  firms  identi-
fying  an  inadequately  skilled  workforce  as  a 
“major” or “very severe” obstacle to business; 
in percent. Figures are from enterprise surveys 
covering  firms  with  at  least  five  employees 
and mainly formal. “Major” and “very severe” 
are the two top levels in a scale of five. Data 
source:  International  Financial  Corporation/
World  Bank  Enterprise  Surveys,  at  http://
www.enterprisesurveys.org.

•   Educational  attainment:  Average  score  in 
reading,  mathematics  and  science;  units  are 
such  that  the  mean  is  500  and  standard  de-
viation  is  100.  Observations  from  PISA  are 
from  students  aged  between  15  years  and 
3 months and 16 years and 2 months at the 
beginning of the assessment period. Observa-
tions from TIMSS (marked with an asterisk) 
are  from  a  nationally  representative  sample 
of all students enrolled in the grade that rep-
resents 8 years of formal schooling, provided 
that the mean age at the time of testing is at 
least  13.5  years.  TIMSS  does  not  assess  edu-
cational attainment in reading. Data sources: 
PISA at http://www.oecd.org/pisa, and TIMSS 
and PIRLS International Study Center, Lynch 
School  of  Education,  Boston  at  http://tims-
sandpirls.bc.edu/index.html.

Table 3: Employment structure

•   Employment by sector: Share of employment 
in primary, secondary, and tertiary activities, 
based on the International Standard Industry 
Classification  (ISIC);  in  percent  (three  indi-
cators).  The  primary  sector  corresponds  to 
division  1  (ISIC  revision  2),  tabulation  cat-
egories A and B (ISIC revision 3), or tabula-
tion category A (ISIC revision 4); it includes 
agriculture, hunting, forestry, and fishing. The 
secondary  sector  encompasses  divisions  2–5 
(ISIC  revision  2),  tabulation  categories  C–F 
(ISIC  revision  3),  or  tabulation  categories 
B–F (ISIC revision 4); it includes mining and 
quarrying (including oil production), manu-
facturing,  construction,  and  public  utilities 
(electricity, gas, and water). The tertiary sector 
corresponds  to  divisions  6–9  (ISIC  revision 
2),  tabulation  categories  G–P  (ISIC  revision 
3),  or  tabulation  categories  G–U  (ISIC  revi-
sion 4); it includes wholesale and retail trade 
and restaurants and hotels; transport, storage, 
and  communications;  financing,  insurance, 
real  estate,  and  business  services;  and  com-
munity,  social,  and  personal  services.  Data 
sources: see table 9.

•   Employment  in  civil  service:  Share  of  total 
employment in the public sector; in percent. 
Public  sector  employment  includes  all  em-
ployment  of  the  general  government  as  de-
fined in System of National Accounts (SNA) 
1993,  plus  resident  and  operating  at  central, 
state (or regional), and local levels of govern-

ment. Persons employed directly by these in-
stitutions are included regardless of their type 
of  employment  contract;  workers  in  state-
owned  enterprises  are  not  included.  Data 
source:  LABORSTA  tables  on “Public  Sector 
Employment”  and  “General  Employment 
Level,” at http://laborsta.ilo.org.

•   Employment  by  work  status:  Share  of  em-
ployment in wage work, self employment, and 
farming;  in  percent  (three  indicators).  The 
self-employed  include  employers  and  non-
remunerated family workers outside farming. 
Data sources: see table 9. 

•   Employment  in  urban  areas:  Share  of  em-
ployment  in  cities  and  towns;  in  percent.  
Urban is defined by national statistical offices. 
Data sources: see table 9.

Table 4: Living standards

•   Wages  by  occupation:  Average  wages  of  ac-
countants,  chemical  engineers,  bus  drivers, 
and sewing machine operators; in annual US$ 
at  2005  prices  (four  indicators).  Wages  are 
based on data from the ILO October Inquiry 
database, calibrated into a normalized format 
referring to average monthly wage rate for an 
adult  worker  and  transformed  into  dollars 
using the exchange rate of the local currency 
in the same year. The data are then converted  
to  2005  prices  using  the  U.S.  GDP  deflator. 
The  methodology  is  described  by  R.H.  Oos-
tendorp,  2012,  “The  Occupational  Wages 
around  the  World  (OWW)  Database:  Up-
date  for  1983–2008,”  background  paper  for 
the  World  Development  Report  2013.  Data 
source: http://www.worldbank.org/wdr2013. 

•   Working  poor:  Share  of  total  employment 
represented  by  workers  who  are  members  of 
households living in extreme poverty; in per-
cent. Households living in extreme poverty are 
identified on the basis of poverty rates comput-
ed from the international poverty line of 1.25 
US$ PPP per day at 2005 prices. The use of the 
international  poverty  line  means  that  figures 
are  not  necessarily  comparable  to  estimates 
generated  using  national  poverty  lines.  Data 
sources: see table 9, and for the poverty rate, see 
http://iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet/.

•   Life satisfaction: Persons aged 14 and above 
who  answered  affirmatively  to  a  survey  ask-
ing  them  whether  they  were  satisfied  with 

their life at the time of the interview; in per-
cent of all respondents; by work status (three 
indicators). The question in the survey is: “All 
things considered, how satisfied are you with 
your life as a whole these days?” Possible an-
swers range from 1(“completely dissatisfied”) 
to 10 (“completely satisfied”). Responses of 6 
or  higher  were  considered  affirmative.  Data 
source:  World  Values  Survey,  1999–2008,  at 
http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org.

•   Labor  share  of  national  income:  Compen-
sation  of  employees  as  a  share  of  GDP;  in 
percent.  Compensation  of  employees  cor-
responds  is  measured  by  account  D.1  in  the 
SNA,  and  GDP  by  account  B.1  in  the  Sys-
tem  of  National  Accounts).  Compensation 
of employees includes payments in cash and 
in-kind.  It  also  includes  government  contri-
butions to social insurance schemes that pro-
vide  benefits  to  the  employees.  Data  source:  
UNDATA, at http://data.un.org. 

•   Gender  gap  in  earnings:  Wage  earnings  for 
women relative to the wage earnings of men 
having the same characteristics; as a ratio. The 
estimate is based on a country-specific regres-
sion of the logarithm of monthly earnings in 
local currency on years of education and po-
tential  years  of  experience  (and  its  square), 
controlling  for  industry,  occupation,  urban 
residence and gender. The methodology is de-
scribed by Claudio E. Montenegro and Harry 
Anthony Patrinos, 2012, “Returns to School-
ing around the World,” background paper for 
the  World  Development  Report  2013.  Data 
sources: see table 9.

Table 5: Productivity

•   Value-added  per  worker:  Total  value-added 
per worker; in annual US$ at 2005 prices; to-
tal and by sector of activity (four indicators). 
Value-added  is  the  output  of  a  sector  net  of 
intermediate  inputs.  It  is  calculated  without 
making deductions for depreciation of fabri-
cated  assets  or  depletion  and  degradation  of 
natural resources. The origin of value-added 
is  determined  by  the  International  Standard 
Industrial  Classification  (ISIC),  revision  3. 
Value-added data are converted to US$ using 
current exchange rates and then converted to 
2005 prices using the U.S. GDP deflator. Data

•   Employment in micro-enterprises:  Share  of 
non-agricultural employment in firms with 10 
or less employees; in percent. In some coun-
tries the cutoff point is 9 employees. All own-
account  workers  and  unpaid  family  workers 
are counted as working in micro-enterprises. 
Both formal and informal firms are included. 
Data sources: see table 9. 

•   Informal  employment:  Share  of  informal 
 employment  in  non-agricultural  employ-
ment;  in  percent.  Informal  employment 
includes  employment  in  informal  sector 
enterprises  and  informal  jobs  in  formal 
firms;  it  excludes  agricultural  employment. 
In  principle,  informal  sector  and  informal 
employment are measured according to the 
Resolution  of  the  15th  International  Con-
ference  of  Labor  Statisticians  (ICLS).  How-
ever,  there  is  wide  variation  in  definitions 
and  methodology  across  countries.  Data

•   Trust:  Share  of  people  who  report  that  oth-
ers  can  be  trusted;  in  percent;  by  work  sta-
tus  (three  indicators).  The  figures  are  based

people can be trusted or that you need to be 
very careful in dealing with people?” The in-
terviewed are at least 14 years old in the case 
of  the World Values  Survey,  16  years  old  for 
the  Latinobarómetro,  18  years  old  for  Arab 
Barometer,  and  15  years  old  for  the  Afro-

•   Civic participation: Share of people who re-
port being engaged in matters related to their 

community  or  country;  in  percent;  by  work 
status (three indicators). The figures are based 
on surveys asking the question: “Now I am go-
ing to read off a list of voluntary organizations. 
For each one, could you tell me whether you 
are an active member, an inactive member or 
not a member of that type of organization?” 
Possible answers include a variety of church or 
religious organizations; sports or recreational 
organizations;  arts,  music  or  educational  or-
ganizations;  labor  unions;  political  parties; 
environmental organizations; professional as-
sociations;  humanitarian  or  charitable  orga-
nizations;  consumer  organizations;  and  oth-
ers. Respondents need to be at least 14 years 
old in the case of the World Values Survey; 18 
years old for Afro Barometer; 15 years old for

•   Wage inequality: Labor earnings at the 90th 
percentile of the wage distribution; as a ratio 
of  labor  earnings  at  the  10th  percentile.  The 
wage  distribution  of  each  country  is  con-
structed  based  on  earnings  data  from  wage 
workers who report positive wages and iden-
tify  the  frequency  of  their  payment.  Data 
sources: see table 9.

•   Minimum wage: The lowest a private sector 
employer  can  pay  a  19-year-old  worker  who 
has no previous experience in the economy’s 
most  populated  city;  in  US$  at  2005  prices. 
The applicable minimum wage can be legally 
enacted or agreed upon in collective bargain-
ing  agreements.  When  a  zero  is  reported,  it 
does  not  necessarily  mean  that  there  is  no 
minimum  wage  in  force  in  the  country  or 
economy. For instance, there may be rates ap-
plicable to regular workers but not to appren-
tices. Data source: Doing Business Indicators, 
at www.doingbusiness.org.

•   Separation  cost:  Severance  pay  and  others 
costs  associated  with  redundancy  dismissal; 
in weeks of salary per separated worker; after 
1  and  10  years  of  continuous  employment 
(two  indicators).  For  comparability,  figures 
refer to a hypothetical worker and firm across  
all  countries.  The  worker  is  a  male,  non- 
executive  employee,  earning  the  economy’s 
average  wage.  The  firm  is  a  limited  liability 
company with 60 workers in the manufactur-
ing  sector  of  the  economy’s  most  populated 
city. Separation costs include the cost of ad-
vance  notice  requirements,  severance  pay-
ments and penalties in the case of redundancy 
dismissals justified by economic, operational 
or structural reasons, not by the behavior of 
the worker. Data source: Doing Business Indi-
cators, at www.doingbusiness.org.

•   Labor market policies: Government spending 
in programs to help the unemployed back to 
work, or to support the income or consump-
tion levels of unemployed or inactive persons; 
in percent of GDP. Seven types of programs 
are  considered:  macroeconomic  stimulus 
policies, measures to increase labor demand,

migrant  workers  are  considered  remittances 
when workers have resided in the host coun-
try for more than a year, irrespective of their 
immigration status. Compensation earned by 
nonresident  workers  refers  to  the  wages  and

Jobs provide higher earnings and better benefits as countries grow, but they 
are also a driver of development. Poverty falls as people work their way out  
of hardship and as jobs empowering women lead to greater investments  
in children. Efficiency increases as workers get better at what they do, as more 
productive jobs appear, and less productive ones disappear. Societies flourish 
as jobs bring together people from different ethnic and social backgrounds 
and provide alternatives to conflict. Jobs are thus more than a byproduct of 
economic growth. They are transformational—they are what we earn, what 
we do, and even who we are.

High unemployment and unmet job expectations among youth are the most 
immediate concerns.  But in many developing countries, where farming and 
self-employment are prevalent and safety nets are modest at best, unemploy-
ment rates can be low. In these countries, growth is seldom jobless. Most of 
the poor work long hours but simply cannot make ends meet. And the 
violation of basic rights is not uncommon. Therefore, the number of jobs  
is not all that matters: jobs with high development payoffs are needed.

Confronted with these challenges, policy makers ask difficult questions. 
Should countries build their development strategies around growth, or 
should they focus on jobs? Can entrepreneurship be fostered, especially 
among the many microenterprises in developing countries, or are entrepre-
neurs born? Are greater investments in education and training a prerequisite 
for employability, or can skills be built through jobs? In times of major crises 
and structural shifts, should jobs, not just workers, be protected? And is there 
a risk that policies supporting job creation in one country will come at the 
expense of jobs in other countries?

The World Development Report 2013: Jobs offers answers to these and other 
difficult questions by looking at jobs as drivers of development—not as 
derived labor demand—and by considering all types of jobs—not just formal 
wage employment.  The Report provides a framework that cuts across sectors 
and shows that the best policy responses vary across countries, depending  
on their levels of development, endowments, demography, and institutions. 
Policy fundamentals matter in all cases, as they enable a vibrant private sector, 
the source of most jobs in the world. Labor policies can help as well, even  
if they are less critical than is often assumed.  Development policies, from 
making smallholder farming viable to fostering functional cities to engaging 
in global markets, hold the key to success.
