We enter the new millennium with great hopes.For the ﬁrst time in human history,we havethe possibility oferadicating global poverty in our lifetime.One hundred and eighty headsofstate signed the Millennium Declaration in October 2000,pledging the world to meetingthe Millennium Development Goals by 2015.In Monterrey,Mexico,in the spring of2002,the world’s nations established a partnership for increasing external assistance,expandingworld trade,and deepening policy and institutional reforms to reach these goals.Foreignaid,which declined during the 1990s,has begun to increase again.But the ﬁrst few years ofthe 21st century bring heightened challenges.HIV/AIDS andother diseases,illiteracy,and unclean water threaten to dash the hopes ofmillions,possiblybillions,ofpeople that they might escape poverty.Tragically,conﬂict has undermined devel-opment in many countries.Peace and development go hand in hand.And even as we learnhow to make development assistance more effective,aid continues to be criticized for notbeing effective enough.This year’s World Development Report,the 26th in the World Bank’s ﬂagship series,helpsto re-ignite and reinforce our hopes by confronting these challenges.Development is notjust about money or even about numerical targets to be achieved by 2015,as important asthose are.It is about people.The WDR focuses on basic services,particularly health,educa-tion,water,and sanitation,seeking ways ofmaking them work for poor people.Too often,services fail poor people.These failures may be less spectacular than ﬁnancial crises,buttheir effects are continuing and deep nonetheless.The report shows that there are powerfulexamples ofservices working for poor people.Services work when they include allthe peo-ple,when girls are encouraged to go to school,when pupils and parents participate in theschooling process,when communities take charge oftheir own sanitation.They work whensocieties can curtail corruption—which hurts poor people more than it hurts the betteroff—particularly when it hits basic health services,which poor people need desperately.They work when we take a comprehensive view ofdevelopment—recognizing that amother’s education will help her baby’s health,that building a road or a bridge will enablechildren to go to school.Services work especially well when we recognize that resources and their effective use areinseparable.More effective use makes additional resources more productive—and the argu-ment for aid more persuasive.External resources can provide strong support for changes inpolicy and practice that can bring more effective use.This is how we can scale up to achievethe Millennium Development Goals.To improve service delivery,the WDR recommends institutional changes that willstrengthen relationships ofaccountability—between policymakers,providers,and citizens.These changes will not come overnight.Solutions must be tailored not to some imaginary“best practice”but to the realities ofthe country or the town or the village.One size will notForewordxv01_WDR_FM.qxd  8/14/03  7:17 AM  Page xv(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

xviWORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004ﬁt all.But I am convinced that this new way ofthinking about service delivery,and indeedabout development effectiveness,will bear fruit,particularly when matched with adequateresources and a desire to assess what works and what does not,and to decide what must bescaled up and,indeed,what must be scaled down.In short,this year’s WDR is central to the World Bank’s two-pronged strategy for devel-opment—investing in and empowering people,and improving the climate for investment.Next year’s WDR will focus on the second ofthese.Together,these reports form part oftheWorld Bank’s contribution to meeting the challenge the global community has set foritself—to eradicate poverty in our lifetime.James D.Wolfensohn01_WDR_FM.qxd  8/14/03  7:17 AM  Page xvi(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

1Too often,services fail poorpeople—in access,in quantity,inquality.But the fact that there arestrong examples where services dowork means governments and citizens cando better.How? By putting poor people atthe center ofservice provision:by enablingthem to monitor and discipline serviceproviders,by amplifying their voice in poli-cymaking,and by strengthening the incen-tives for providers to serve the poor.Freedom from illness and freedom fromilliteracy—two ofthe most important wayspoor people can escape poverty—remainelusive to many.To accelerate progress inhuman development,economic growth is,ofcourse,necessary.But it is not enough.Scaling up will require both a substantialincrease in external resources and moreeffective use ofall resources,internal andexternal.As resources become more produc-tive,the argument for additional resourcesbecomes more persuasive.And externalresources can provide strong support forchanges in practice and policy to bringabout more effective use.The two are com-plementary—that is the essence ofthedevelopment partnership that was cementedin Monterrey in the spring of2002.This Report builds an analytical andpractical framework for using resources,whether internal or external,more effec-tively by making services work for poorpeople.We focus on those services thathave the most direct link with humandevelopment—education,health,water,sanitation,and electricity.Governments and citizens use a varietyofmethods ofdelivering these services—central government provision,contractingout to the private sector and nongovern-mental organizations (NGO)s,decentral-ization to local governments,communityparticipation,and direct transfers to house-holds.There have been spectacular suc-cesses and miserable failures.Both point tothe need to strengthen accountability inthree key relationships in the service deliv-ery chain:between poor people andproviders,between poor people and policy-makers,and between policymakers andproviders.Foreign-aid donors should rein-force the accountability in these relation-ships,not undermine it.Increasing poor clients’choice and partic-ipation in service delivery will help themmonitor and discipline providers.Raisingpoor citizens’voice,through the ballot boxand widely available information,canincrease their inﬂuence with policymakers—and reduce the diversion ofpublic services tothe non-poor for political patronage.Byrewarding the effective delivery ofservicesand penalizing the ineffective,policymakerscan get providers to serve poor people better.Innovating with service delivery arrange-ments will not be enough.Societies shouldlearn from their innovations by systemati-cally evaluating and disseminating informa-tion about what works and what doesn’t.Only then can the innovations be scaled upto improve the lives ofpoor people aroundthe world.The challenge is formidable,becausemaking services work for poor peopleinvolves changing not only service deliveryarrangements but also public sector institu-tions.It also involves changing the way muchforeign aid is transferred.As governments,citizens,and donors create incentives forthese changes,they should be selective in theproblems they choose to address.Theyshould be realistic about implementationdifﬁculties.And they should be patient.OverviewI go to collect water four times aday,in a 20-litre clay jar.It’s hardwork! ...I’ve never been to schoolas I have to help my mother withher washing work so we can earnenough money....Our housedoesn’t have a bathroom....IfIcould alter my life,I would reallylike to go to school and have moreclothes.Elma Kassa,a 13-year-old girlfrom Addis Ababa,Ethiopia02_WDR_Overview.qxd  8/14/03  7:22 AM  Page 1(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

The problemPoverty has many dimensions.In addition tolow income (living on less than $1 a day),illiteracy,ill health,gender inequality,andenvironmental degradation are all aspects ofbeing poor.This is reﬂected in the Millen-nium Development Goals,the internationalcommunity’s unprecedented agreement onthe goals for reducing poverty (box 1).Themultidimensional nature ofpoverty is alsoreﬂected in the World Bank’s two-prongedstrategy for development—investing in peo-ple and improving the investment climate.That ﬁve ofthe eight goals and one ofthe twoprongs ofthe strategy for development con-cern health and education signals how centralhuman development is to human welfare.But progress in human development haslagged behind that in reducing incomepoverty (ﬁgure 1).The world as a whole ison track to achieve the ﬁrst goal—reducingby halfthe proportion ofpeople living onless than $1 a day—thanks mainly to rapideconomic growth in India and China,wheremany ofthe world’s poor live.1But theworld is offtrack in reaching the goals forprimary education,gender equality,andchild mortality.To reach all ofthese goals,economicgrowth is essential.But it will not beenough.The projected growth in per capitaGDP will by itselfenable ﬁve ofthe world’ssix developing regions to reach the goal forreducing income poverty (table 1).But thatgrowth will enable only two ofthe regions toachieve the primary enrollment goal andnone ofthem to reach the child mortalitygoal.Ifthe economic growth projected forAfrica doubles,the region will reach theincome poverty goal—but still fall short ofthe health and education goals.In Uganda,despite average annual per capita GDPgrowth of3.9 percent in the past decade,child mortality is stagnating—and onlypartly due to the AIDS epidemic.2Because growth alone will not be enoughto reach the goals,the international com-munity has committed itself—in a series ofrecent meetings in Monterrey,Doha,andJohannesburg—to greater resource trans-2WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Figure 1Progress in humandevelopment: off trackNote:Blue line is the trend line to reach theMillenium Development Goal.

Overview3fers by developed countries and better poli-cies and institutions in developing coun-tries.The level ofresource transfers is difﬁ-cult to calculate precisely.Some estimatesare converging around a ﬁgure of$40 bil-lion to $60 billion a year in additional for-eign aid—so long as the money is accompa-nied by policy and institutional reforms toenhance the productivity ofdomestic andexternal resources.3Focusing on the human developmentgoals,this Report describes the reforms inservices needed to achieve them.Ensuringbasic health and education outcomes is theresponsibility ofthe state (box 2).But manygovernments are falling short on their oblig-ation,especially to poor people.In Armeniaand Cambodia,child mortality rates for thepoorest ﬁfth ofthe population are two tothree times those for the richest ﬁfth.Onlyabout 60 percent ofthe adolescents in thepoorest ﬁfth ofthe population in the ArabRepublic ofEgypt and Peru have completedprimary school,while all those from therichest ﬁfth have.To meet this responsibility,governmentsand citizens need to make the services thatcontribute to health and education—water,sanitation,energy,transport,health,and edu-cation—work for poor people.Too often,these services are failing.Sometimes,they arefailing everybody—except the rich,who canopt out ofthe public system.But at othertimes,they are clearly failing poor people.Services are failing poor people in four waysHow do we know that these services are fail-ing poor people? First,while governmentsdevote about a third oftheir budgets tohealth and education,they spend very little ofit on poor people—that is,on the servicespoor people need to improve their health andeducation.Public spending on health andeducation is typically enjoyed by the non-poor (ﬁgure 2).In Nepal 46 percent ofeduca-tion spending accrues to the richest ﬁfth,only11 percent to the poorest.In India the richestﬁfth receives three times the curative healthcare subsidy ofthe poorest ﬁfth.4Eventhough clean water is critical to health out-comes,in Morocco only 11 percent ofthepoorest ﬁfth ofthe population has access toBy ﬁnancing,providing,or regulating theservices that contribute to health and edu-cation outcomes,governments around theworld demonstrate their responsibility forthe health and education of their people.Why? First,these services are replete withmarket failures—with externalities,as whenan infected child spreads a disease to play-mates or a farmer beneﬁts from aneighbor’s ability to read.So the private sec-tor,left to its devices,will not achieve thelevel of health and education that societydesires.Second,basic health and basic edu-cation are considered fundamental humanrights.The Universal Declaration of HumanRights asserts an individual’s right to “a stan-dard of living adequate for the health andwell-being of himself and of his family,including ...medical care ...[and a right toeducation that is] ...free,at least in the ele-mentary and fundamental stages.”No mat-ter how daunting the problems of deliverymay be,the public sector cannot walk awayfrom health and education.The challenge isto see how the government—in collabora-tion with the private sector,communities,and outside partners—can meet this funda-mental responsibility.BOX 2Services—a public responsibility02_WDR_Overview.qxd  8/14/03  7:22 AM  Page 3(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

4WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004safe water,while everybody in the richest ﬁfthdoes (ﬁgure 3).Second,even when public spending canbe reallocated toward poor people—say,byshifting to primary schools and clinics—themoney does not always reach the frontlineservice provider.In the early 1990s inUganda the share ofnonsalary spending onprimary education that actually reachedprimary schools was 13 percent.This wasthe average:poorer schools received wellbelow the average.5Third,even ifthis share is increased—asthe Ugandans have done—teachers must bepresent and effective at their jobs,just as doc-tors and nurses must provide the care thatpatients need.But they are often mired in asystem where the incentives for effective ser-vice delivery are weak,wages may not bepaid,corruption is rife,and political patron-age is a way oflife.Highly trained doctors sel-dom wish to serve in remote rural areas.Since those who do serve there are rarelymonitored,the penalties for not being atwork are low.A survey ofprimary health carefacilities in Bangladesh found the absenteerate among doctors to be 74 percent.6Whenpresent,some service providers treat poorpeople badly.“They treat us like animals,”says a patient in West Africa.7 By no means do all frontline serviceproviders behave this way.Many,often themajority,are driven by an intrinsic motivationto serve.Be it through professional pride or agenuine commitment to help poor people (orboth),many teachers and health workersdeliver timely,efﬁcient,and courteous ser-vices,often in difﬁcult circumstances—collapsing buildings,overﬂowing latrines—and with few resources—clinics withoutdrugs,classes without textbooks.8The chal-lenge is to reinforce this experience—to repli-cate the professional ethics,intrinsic motiva-tion,and other incentives ofthese providersin the rest ofthe service work force.The fourth way services fail poor people isthe lack ofdemand.Poor people often don’tsend their children to school or take them to aclinic.In Bolivia 60 percent ofthe childrenwho died before age ﬁve had not seen a for-mal provider during the illness culminatingin their death.Sometimes the reason is thepoor quality ofthe service—missing materi-als,absent workers,abusive treatment.Atother times it is because they are poor.Evenwhen the services are free,many poor ruralfamilies cannot afford the time it takes totravel the nearly 8 kilometers to the nearestprimary school in Mali or the 23 kilometersto the nearest medical facility in Chad.9020Percent40Bulgaria1995Costa Rica1992Madagascar1993Cote d’Ivoire1995ˆBangladesh2000All health spendingIndia1995/96Ecuador1998Armenia1999Guinea1994020Percent40Primary health020Percent40Kenya1992Romania1994Morocco1998/99Brazil 1997(NE&SE)Mexico1996All education spendingCambodia1996/97Nicaragua1998Kosovo2000Nepal1996020Percent40Primary education Percent richestquintilePercent poorestquintileFigure 2More public spending for the rich than for the poorShare of public spending that accrues to the richest and poorest ﬁfthsSource:Compiled from various sources by World Bank staff.02_WDR_Overview.qxd  8/14/03  7:23 AM  Page 4(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Weak demand can also be due to culturalfactors,notably gender.Some parents refuseto send their daughters to school.Husbandshave been known to prevent their wives fromgoing to clinics—even for deliveries.And thesocial distance between poor people and ser-vice providers (70 percent ofnurses and mid-wives in rural Niger had been raised in thecity) is often a deterrent.Alternative service deliveryarrangementsEnsuring access to basic services such ashealth,education,water,energy,and sanitationis a public responsibility today,but it has notalways been.Nor do governments dischargethis responsibility solely through central-government provision.Throughout historyand around the world,societies have tried dif-ferent arrangements—with mixed results.•Some governments contract servicesout—to the private sector,to NGOs,even to other public agencies.In theaftermath ofa civil war Cambodia in-troduced two forms ofcontracting forthe delivery ofprimary health care(“contracting out”whole services and“contracting in”some services).Ran-domly assigning the arrangementsacross 12 districts (to avoid systematicbias),it found that health indicators,aswell as use by the poor,increased most inthe districts contracting out.10Whetherthis can be scaled up beyond 12 districtsin Cambodia is worth exploring.•Governments also sell concessions to theprivate sector—in water,transport,elec-tricity—with some very good and somevery bad results.Privatizing water inCartagena,Colombia,improved servicesand access for the poor.A similar sale inTucuman,Argentina,led to riots in thestreets and a reversal ofthe concession.•Some societies transfer responsibility(for ﬁnancing,provision,and regula-tion) to lower tiers ofgovernment.Again,the record has varied—withpotentially weaker capacity and greaterpolitical patronage at the local level andthe reduced scope for redistributionsometimes outweighing the beneﬁtsfrom greater local participation.Local-government delivery ofinfrastructure inSouth Africa improved service provisionin a short time.11But decentralizingsocial assistance in Romania weakenedthe ability and incentives oflocal coun-cils to deliver cash transfers to the poor.12The program is now being recentralized.•Responsibility is sometimes transferred tocommunities—or to the clients themselves.El Salvador’s Community-Managed SchoolsProgram (Educo) gives parents’associationsthe right to hire and ﬁre teachers.That,plusthe monthly visits to the schools by the par-ents’associations,has reduced teacher—andstudent—absenteeism,improving studentperformance.•Still other programs transfer resources andresponsibility to the household.Mexico’sEducation,Health,and Nutrition Program(Progresa) gives cash to families iftheirchildren are enrolled in school and theyregularly visit a clinic.Numerous evalua-tions ofthe program show consistentlythat it increased school enrollment (eightpercentage points for girls and ﬁve forboys at the secondary level) and improvedchildren’s health (illness among youngchildren fell 20 percent).13Overview5Figure 3Water, water everywhere, nor any drop todrinkPercent of households who use an improved watersource (selected countries)Source: World Bank staff.020406080100Uzbekistan 1996India 1998–99Brazil 1996Philippines 1998Tanzania 1999Indonesia 1997Nicaragua 1998Kazakhstan 1999Cambodia 2000Guinea 1999Morocco 1995Ethiopia 2000PoorestfifthRichestfifth02_WDR_Overview.qxd  8/14/03  7:24 AM  Page 5(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

6WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004The framework of relationships—between clients,providers,and policymakersTo help understand the variety ofexperienceswith traditional and alternative service deliv-ery arrangements,the service delivery chaincan be unbundled into three sets ofactors,and the relationships between them exam-ined (ﬁgure 4).Poor people—as patients inclinics,students in schools,travelers on buses,consumers ofwater—are the clients ofser-vices.They have a relationship with the front-line providers,with schoolteachers,doctors,bus drivers,water companies.Poor peoplehave a similar relationship when they buysomething in the market,such as a sandwich(or a samosa,a salteña,a shoo-mai).In acompetitive-market transaction,they get the“service”because they can hold the provideraccountable.That is,the consumer pays theprovider directly;he can observe whether ornot he has received the sandwich;and ifhe isdissatisﬁed,he has power over the providerwith repeat business or,in the case offraud,with legal or social sanctions.For the services considered here—such ashealth,education,water,electricity,andsanitation—there is no direct accountabilityofthe provider to the consumer.Why not? Forvarious good reasons,society has decided thatthe service will be provided not through amarket transaction but through the govern-ment taking responsibility (see box 2).That is,through the “long route”ofaccountability—by clients as citizens inﬂuencing policymak-ers,and policymakers inﬂuencing providers.When the relationships along this long routebreak down,service delivery fails (absenteeteachers,leaking water pipes) and humandevelopment outcomes are poor.Consider the ﬁrst ofthe two relationshipsalong the long route—the link between poorpeople and policymakers or politicians (ﬁg-ure 4).Poor people are citizens.In principle,they contribute to deﬁning society’s collectiveobjectives,and they try to control publicaction to achieve those objectives.In practice,this does not always work.Either they areexcluded from the formulation ofcollectiveobjectives or they cannot inﬂuence publicaction because ofweaknesses in the electoralsystem.Free public services and “no-show”jobs are handed out as political patronage,with poor people rarely the beneﬁciaries.Even ifpoor people can reach the policy-maker,services will not improve unless thepolicymaker can ensure that the serviceprovider will deliver services to them.InCambodia,policymakers were able to specifythe services required to the NGOs withwhom they contracted.But for many ser-vices,such as student learning or curativecare,the policymaker may not be able tospecify the nature ofthe service,much lessimpose penalties for underperformance ofthe contract.Teacher and health-workerabsenteeism is often the result.Given the weaknesses in the long route ofaccountability,service outcomes can beimproved by strengthening the short route—by increasing the client’s power overproviders.School voucher schemes (Colom-bia’s PACES) or scholarships (Bangladesh’sFemale Secondary School Assistance Pro-gram,in which schools receive a grant basedon the number ofgirls they enroll) enableclients to exert inﬂuence over providersthrough choice.El Salvador’s Educo programand Guinea’s revolving drug scheme (whereco-payments inspired villagers to stop theft)are ways for client participation to improveservice provision.14Turn now to a closer look at the individualrelationships in the service delivery chain—why they break down,how they can bestrengthened.Citizens and politicians/policymakers—stronger voice Poor citizens have little clout with politicians.In some countries the citizenry has only aweak hold on politicians.Even ifthere is awell-functioning electoral system,poor peo-Figure 4The framework of accountabilityrelationshipsPolicymakersPoor peopleProviders02_WDR_Overview.qxd  8/14/03  7:24 AM  Page 6(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Overview7ple may not be able to inﬂuence politiciansabout public services:they may not be wellinformed about the quality ofpublic services(and politicians know this);they may votealong ethnic or ideological lines,placing lessweight on public services when evaluatingpoliticians;or they may not believe the candi-dates who promise better public services—because their term in ofﬁce is too short todeliver on the promise—and they may voteinstead for candidates who provide readycash and jobs.As a result,public services often becomethe currency ofpolitical patronage and clien-telism.Politicians give “phantom”jobs toteachers and doctors.They build free publicschools and clinics in areas where their sup-porters live.Former Boston mayor JamesCurley strengthened his political base by con-centrating public services in the IrishCatholic areas while denying them to theProtestants,who eventually moved to thesuburbs.15In 1989 Mexico introduced PRONASOL(Programa Nacional de Solidaridad,orNational Solidarity Program),a poverty alle-viation program that spent 1.2 percent ofGDP annually on water,electricity,nutrition,and education construction in poor commu-nities.Assessments ofthe six-year programfound that it reduced poverty by only about3 percent.Had the budget been distributedto maximize its impact on poverty,theexpected decline would have been 64 per-cent.It would have been 13 percent evenwith an untargeted,universal proportionaltransfer to the whole population.The reasonbecomes apparent when one examines thepolitical afﬁliation ofcommunities thatreceived PRONASOL spending.Municipali-ties dominated by the Institutional Revolu-tionary Party (PRI),the party in power,received signiﬁcantly higher per capita trans-fers than those voting for another party (ﬁg-ure 5).16Just as a well-functioning democracy doesnot guarantee that poor people will beneﬁtfrom public services,some one-party statesget good health and education outcomes—even among the poor.Cuba has among thebest social indicators in Latin America—at amuch lower income than its peers,such asChile and Costa Rica.China reduced infantmortality dramatically,and achieved nearlyuniversal primary enrollment.To be sure,inChina,cases during the earliest phase oftheoutbreak ofsevere acute respiratory syn-drome in 2002 were not openly reported—thus making its further spread almostinevitable.And Cubans,who had high levelsofhealth and education in the 1950s,remainpoor on other dimensions.17The lesson seems to be that the citizen-policymaker link is working either when citi-zens can hold policymakers accountable forpublic services that beneﬁt the poor or whenthe policymaker cares about the health andeducation ofpoor people.These politics are“pro-poor.”What can be done when the politics arenot pro-poor? Societies can still introducevarious intermediate elements to make pub-lic institutions more accountable.Participa-tory budgeting in Porto Allegre,Brazil,started as a means for the citizens to partici-pate in budget formulation and then to holdthe municipal government accountable forexecuting the budget.Perhaps the most powerful means ofincreasing the voice ofpoor citizens in poli-cymaking is better information.When thegovernment ofUganda learned that only 13percent ofrecurrent spending for primaryeducation was arriving in primary schools,itlaunched a monthly newspaper campaign onthe transfer offunds.That campaign galva-nized the populace,inducing the government0198919901991199219931994PRIPRDPANOther200100300400Average expenditures per capita (real 1995 pesos)Figure 5It paid to vote for PRIPRONASOL expenditures according to party in municipalgovernmentNote:PRI = Instituational Revolutionary Party; PRD = Party of theDemocratic Revolution; PAN = National Action Party.Source:Estévez, Magaloni, and Diaz-Cayeros (2002).PolicymakersPoor people02_WDR_Overview.qxd  8/14/03  7:24 AM  Page 7(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

to increase the share going to primary schools(now over 80 percent) and compelling schoolprincipals to post the entire budget on theschoolroom door.The media can do much to disseminateinformation about public services.Highernewspaper circulation in Indian districts isassociated with better local-government per-formance in distributing food and droughtrelief.18The more people who can read,thestronger the inﬂuence ofthe media.In Ker-ala,India,this led to a virtuous cycle ofliter-acy leading to better public services,whichraised literacy even more.19But information is not enough.Peoplemust also have the legal,political,and eco-nomic means to press demands against thegovernment.Most citizens in Uttar Pradesh,India,know that government services aredismal,and know that everyone else knowsthat—and yet most do not feel free tocomplain.20Policymakers and providers—stronger compactsStrengthening poor people’s voice canmake policymakers wantto improve ser-vices for the poor.But they still may not beable to.Well-intentioned policymakersoften cannot offer the incentives and do themonitoring to ensure that providers servethe poor.The absenteeism ofteachers,therude treatment ofpatients,and the siphon-ing ofpharmaceuticals are symptoms ofthe problem.Even in the private sector,where theincentives presumably are better aligned,per-formance is not much better—for the samereasons that private markets are not the solu-tion to these problems in the ﬁrst place.Pri-vate providers fail to reach the very poor.Weak regulation leads to poor-quality healthservices in India’s private sector.Ineffectivelyprivatizing water incites riots in the streets ofCochabamba.In the former Soviet Union,state andparty control over providers ensured compli-ance with delivery norms for free services.Services worked,and levels ofhealth status,particularly for the poorer Central Asianrepublics,were much higher than for othercountries at their level ofincome.But thebreakup ofthe Soviet Union weakened statecontrol over providers,and health and educa-tion services collapsed.Solving the problem requires mentally,and sometimes physically,separating thepolicymaker from the provider—and think-ing ofthe relationship between the two as acompact.The provider agrees to deliver aservice,in return for being rewarded orpenalized depending on performance.Thecompact may be an explicit contract with aprivate or nonproﬁt organization—orbetween tiers ofgovernment,as in Johan-nesburg,South Africa.21Or it could beimplicit,as in the employment agreementsofcivil servants.Separating the policymaker from theprovider is not easy,for those who beneﬁtfrom the lack ofseparation may resist it.Teachers’unions in Uttar Pradesh,India,blocked an attempt to put teacher hiring,ﬁring,and attendance under the control ofthe village panchayat.On the other hand,health professionals in Brazil participated ina national coalition that prepared the planfor health reforms and municipal healthcouncils.22The separation usually happensbecause ofa ﬁscal crisis (Johannesburg),amajor political change (decentralization inLatin America),or a legacy ofhistory (pub-lic regulation ofwater providers in theNetherlands).Even with a separation ofpolicymakerand provider,the compacts cannot be tooexplicit.It is difﬁcult to specify precisely whatthe schoolteacher should do at every point inthe day.Too much speciﬁcity can lead toinﬂexibility.Parisian taxi drivers,to make apoint about excessive regulations,sometimesmeticulously follow the rules in the Code de laroute—slowing trafﬁc in the French capital toa snail’s pace.23Since the contract cannot be fully speci-ﬁed,policymakers look to other means ofeliciting pro-poor services from providers.One way is to choose providers who have anintrinsic motivation to serve the poor.Astudy offaith-based health care providers inUganda estimates that they work for 28 per-cent less than government and private for-proﬁt staff,and yet provide a signiﬁcantlyhigher quality ofcare than the public sec-tor.24Another way is to increase incentivesto serve the poor or work in underserved8WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004PolicymakersProviders02_WDR_Overview.qxd  8/14/03  7:25 AM  Page 8(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

areas.But one study ofIndonesia showsthat it would require multiples ofcurrentpay levels to get doctors to live in WestPapua,for instance (where the vacancy rateis 60 percent).25A third way is to solicit bidsfor services and use the competition in thebidding process to monitor and disciplineproviders.Many water concessions are man-aged this way.A recent innovation in Mad-hya Pradesh,India,allows NGOs to competefor concessions to primary schools,withpayments conditional on higher test scoresbased on independent measurement.As with the citizen-politician relationship,a critical element in the policymaker-provider relationship is information.Thepolicymaker can specify a contract based onlyon what he can observe—on what informa-tion is available.There has to be a method formonitoring providers and for having thatinformation reach the policymaker.Newtechnologies,including e-government,canmake this easier.26So can some ingenious methods usinghuman beings.When Ceará,Brazil,hired acadre ofdistrict health workers,the govern-ment sent their names to the applicants whowere not selected,inviting them to report anyproblems with service in the health clinics.More fundamentally,these output-basedincentive schemes require rigorous programevaluation,so that the policymaker knowsand understands what is working and whatisn’t.Evaluation-based information,impor-tant not only for monitoring providers,alsoenables the rest ofthe world to learn aboutservice delivery.Clients and providers—morechoices,more participation Given the difﬁculties in strengthening the longroute ofaccountability,improving the shortroute—the client-provider relationship—deserves more consideration.There is noquestion that this relationship is broken forhundreds ofmillions ofpoor people.Voicesofthe Poor and other surveys point to thehelplessness that poor people feel beforeproviders—nurses hitting mothers duringchildbirth,doctors refusing to treat patients ofa lower caste.27Unlike most private providers,public water companies funded through bud-getary transfers often ignore their customers.These are but symptoms ofthe larger prob-lem:many service delivery arrangementsneglect the role ofclients,especially poorclients,in making services work better.Clients can play two roles in strengtheningservice delivery.First,for many services,clients can help tailor the service to theirneeds,since the actual mix cannot be speciﬁedin advance.In some parts ofPakistan,girls aremore likely to attend school ifthere is a femaleteacher.The construction ofseparate latrinesfor girls has had a strong effect on girls’enroll-ment in primary schools.When the openinghours ofhealth clinics are more convenientfor farmers,visits increase.Second,clients canbe effective monitors ofproviders,since theyare at the point ofservice delivery.The majorbeneﬁt ofEduco came from the weekly visitsofthe community education association toschools.Each additional visit reduced studentabsenteeism (due to teacher absenteeism) by 3percent.28How can the role ofclients in revealingdemand and monitoring providers bestrengthened? By increasing poor people’schoice and participation in service delivery.When clients are given a choice among ser-vice providers,they reveal their demand by“voting with their feet.”Female patients whofeel more comfortable with female doctorscan go to one.The competition created byclient choice also disciplines providers.Adoctor may refuse to treat lower-castepatients,but ifhe is paid by the number ofpatients seen,he will be concerned when thewaiting room is empty.Reimbursing schoolsbased on the number ofstudents (or femalestudents) they enroll creates implicit compe-tition among schools for students,increasingstudents’choice.School voucher programs—as in Ban-gladesh,Chile,Colombia,Côte d’Ivoire,andCzech Republic—are explicitly aimed atimproving education quality by increasingparents’choices.The evidence on theseschemes is mixed,however.They seem tohave improved student performance amongsome groups.But the effects on the poor areambiguous because universal voucherschemes tend to increase sorting—withricher students concentrating in the privateschools.29When the voucher is restricted topoor or disadvantaged groups,the effects areOverview9Poor peopleProviders02_WDR_Overview.qxd  8/14/03  7:25 AM  Page 9(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

better.30The Colombia program showedlower repetition rates and higher perfor-mance on standardized tests for students par-ticipating in the scheme—with the effect forgirls higher than that for boys.31Even in net-work systems such as urban water provision,it is possible to give poor communitieschoice—by allowing the poor to approachindependent providers,introducing ﬂexibil-ity in service standards such as lifeline rates,and so on.When there is no choice ofproviders,increasing poor people’s participation in ser-vice provision—giving them the ability tomonitor and discipline the provider,forexample—can achieve similar results.Clientscan play the role ofmonitors since they arepresent at the point ofservice.But they needto have an incentive to monitor.In Bangladesh,thanks to reduced importtariffs,households were able to purchasetubewells that tapped ground sources—shal-low aquifers—for drinking water.Unfortu-nately,no one arranged for the monitoring ofwater quality—a public good—so the arsenicin the water went undetected.Ifthe stakes arehigh enough,communities tackle the prob-lem.When the Zambian government intro-duced a road fund ﬁnanced by a charge ontrucks,truck drivers took turns policing abridge crossing to make sure that overloadedtrucks did not cross.Ofcourse such co-payments or user fees reduce demand—andso should not be used when the demandeffects outweigh the increase in supply,as inprimary education.But for water,electricity,and other services whose beneﬁts are enjoyedmainly by the user,charging for them has theadded beneﬁt ofincreasing the consumer’sincentive to monitor the provider.Farmers inAndhra Pradesh,India,are ﬁnding that,whenthey pay for their water,the irrigation depart-ment becomes more accountable to them.Inthe words ofone farmer,“We will never allowthe government to again give us free water.”32Donors and recipients—strengthening accountability,not undermining itImproving service outcomes for poor peoplerequires strengthening the three relationshipsin the chain—between client and provider,between citizen and policymaker,andbetween policymaker and provider.In theirzeal to get services to the poor,donors oftenbypass one or more ofthese relationships.The typical mode ofdelivering aid—aproject—is often implemented by a separateunit outside the compact,bypassing the rela-tionship between policymakers and pro-viders.The project is typically ﬁnanced byearmarked funds subject to donor-mandatedﬁduciary requirements.It and other donorinitiatives,including global “funds,”bypassthe citizen-policymaker relationship wherethe budget is concerned.To be sure,when theexisting relationship is dysfunctional,it maybe necessary to go around it.But the caseswhere the beneﬁts outweigh the costs areprobably fewer than imagined.Recognizing the gap between ends andmeans,some donors and recipients try to useforeign aid to strengthen,not weaken,thelinks in the service delivery chain.Oneapproach is to incorporate donor assistancein the recipient’s budget,shifting to the recip-ient’s accountability system.In Uganda assis-tance from Germany,Ireland,the Nether-lands,Norway,United Kingdom,and theWorld Bank is all part ofthe country’s bud-get,the outcome ofa coordinated and partic-ipatory process.Another approach is for donors to pooltheir assistance in a single “pot”and to har-monize their ﬁduciary standards around thatofthe rest ofthe government.The sectorwideapproach to health,education,transport,andother sectors is a step in this direction.Possi-bly the biggest payoffcomes when donorshelp generate knowledge—as when donor-ﬁnanced impact evaluation studies revealwhat works and what doesn’t in service deliv-ery,or when donors pool technical assistanceresources at the retail level,as in the multi-donor Water and Sanitation Program.Knowledge is essential to scaling up servicedelivery.Although it emerges locally,it is aglobal public good—precisely what aid isdesigned to ﬁnance.What not to doThe picture painted so farofthe difﬁculties ingovernment-led service delivery may leadsome to conclude that government shouldgive up and leave everything to the privatesector.That would be wrong.Ifindividuals10WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 200402_WDR_Overview.qxd  8/14/03  7:26 AM  Page 10(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

are left to their own devices,they will notprovide levels ofeducation and health thatthey collectively desire (see box 2).Not onlyis this true in theory,but in practice nocountry has achieved signiﬁcant improve-ment in child mortality and primary educa-tion without government involvement.Fur-thermore,as mentioned earlier,privatesector or NGO participation in health,edu-cation,and infrastructure is not withoutproblems—especially in reaching poor peo-ple.The extreme position is clearly notdesirable.Some aid donors take a variant ofthe“leave-everything-to-the-private-sector”posi-tion.Ifgovernment services are performingso badly,they say,why give more aid to thosegovernments? That would be equally wrong.There is now substantial research showingthat aid is productive in countries with goodpolicies and institutions,and those policiesand institutions have recently been improv-ing.33The reforms detailed in this Report(aimed at recipient countries and aid agen-cies) can make aid even more productive.When policies and institutions are improv-ing,aid should increase,not decrease,to real-ize the mutually shared objective ofpovertyreduction,as speciﬁed in the MillenniumDevelopment Goals.At the same time,simply increasing publicspending—without seeking improvements inthe efﬁciency ofthat spending—is unlikely toreap substantial beneﬁts.The productivity ofpublic spending varies enormously acrosscountries.Ethiopia and Malawi spendroughly the same amount per person on pri-mary education—with very different out-comes.Peru and Thailand spend vastly differ-ent amounts—with similar outcomes.On average,the relationship betweenpublic spending on health and educationand the outcomes is weak or nonexistent.Asimple scatter plot ofspending and out-comes shows a clear line with a signiﬁcantslope—because richer countries spend moreon health and education and have better out-comes.But controlling for the effect ofpercapita income,the relationship betweenpublic spending on health and under-ﬁvemortality rates is not statistically signiﬁcant(ﬁgure 6).That is not surprising:most publicspending on health and education goes toOverview11the non-poor,much ofit fails to reach thefrontline service provider,and serviceproviders face weak incentives to deliver ser-vices effectively.Linked to the “simply-increase-public-spending”approach is one that advocates formore foreign aid without accompanyingmeasures to improve the productivity offor-eign aid.This can be just as misleading—andnot just for the same reasons that simplyincreasing public expenditure is misleading.Sometimes the modes ofdelivering foreignaid,by undermining rather than strengthen-ing service delivery in the recipient country,can reduce the productivity ofpublic spend-ing in the medium run.Finally,when faced with disappointinghealth and education outcomes,especiallyfor poor people,it is tempting to recom-mend a technical solution that addresses theproximate cause ofthe problem.Why notgive vitamin A supplements,de-wormschoolchildren,and train teachers better?Why not develop a “minimum package”ofhealth interventions for everybody?Although each intervention is valuable,rec-ommending them alone will not addressthe fundamental institutional problemsthat precluded their adoption in the ﬁrstplace.34Lack ofknowledge about the righttechnical solution is probably not the bind-ing constraint.What is needed is a set ofinstitutional arrangements that will giveFigure 6Increased public spending is not enough*Public spending and child mortality are given as the percentdeviation from rate predicted by GDP per capita.Note:For the regression line shown, the coefﬁcient is –0.148 andthe t-statistic is 1.45.Source:GDP per capita and public spending data, WorldDevelopment Indicators database; under-5 mortality, UNICEF.–150–100–500Per capita public spending on health, 1990s average*Under-five mortality rate, 2000*50100150–150–100–5005010015002_WDR_Overview.qxd  8/14/03  7:26 AM  Page 11(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

policymakers,providers,and citizens theincentives to adopt the solution and adapt itto local conditions.What can be done?The varied experience with traditional andinnovative modes ofservice delivery clearlyshows that no single solution ﬁts all servicesin all countries.The framework ofaccount-ability relationships explains why.In differ-ent sectors and countries,different relation-ships need strengthening.In education thebiggest payoffmay come from strengthen-ing the client-provider link,as with vouch-ers in Colombia or scholarships for girls inBangladesh.But that may not be so inimmunization campaigns.Furthermore,poor people are oftentrapped in a system ofdysfunctional service-delivery relationships.Making just one linkmore effective may not be enough—it mayeven be counterproductive—ifthere are seri-ous problems elsewhere in the service deliv-ery chain.In water or curative health care,tightening the policymaker-provider linkcould make providers respond more to thedemands oftheir superiors—and less totheir poor clients.Relying on user groups,often generously funded by donors,mayinhibit the development ofgenuinely demo-cratic local governments.Finally,countries,and regions within countries,vary enor-mously in the conditions that make serviceinnovations work.A failed state mired inconﬂict will be overstretched in resourcesand institutional capacity,and able to man-age only certain interventions.Countrieswith high prevalence ofHIV/AIDS willrequire short- and long-term adaptations ofthe service delivery systems.Does this mean there are no generallessons about making services work forpoor people? No.The experience with ser-vice delivery,viewed through the lens ofthis Report,suggests a constellation ofsolutions,each matching various charac-teristics ofthe service and the country orregion.While no one size ﬁts all,perhapseight sizes do.Even eight may be too few,which is why some ofthe “sizes”areadjustable,like waistbands.The eight sizes can be arrived at byanswering a series ofquestions.Pro-poor or clientelist politics?How much is the political system in thecountry geared toward pro-poor public ser-vices—and how much does it suffer fromclientelist politics and corruption? This is themost difﬁcult dimension for an outside actor,such as a donor,to address:the recipient ofthe advice may also be the source ofthe prob-lem.And politics do not change overnight.Even so,at least three sets ofpolicy instru-ments can be deployed where the politics aremore clientelist than pro-poor.•First is choosing the level ofgovernmentresponsible for the service.Countries dif-fer in the patronage politics and capabili-ties ofdifferent tiers ofgovernment—and this should inform the servicedelivery arrangement.•Second,ifpoliticians are likely to capturethe rents from free public services anddistribute them to their clients,anarrangement that reduces the rents mayleave the poor better off.This mightinclude transparent and publicly knownrules for allocation,such as per-studentgrants to schools,or conditional transfersto households,as in Progresa.In somecases it may include fees to reduce thevalue ofthe politicians’distribution deci-sions.India’s power sector was nationallyowned and run because it was a network(and therefore not amenable to head-to-head competition).But the huge rentsfrom providing subsidized electricityhave been diverted to people who are notpoor—all within a parliamentary democ-racy.Reducing those rents by raisingpower tariffs or having the private sectorprovide electricity,even ifit violates theprinciples ofequity—they are alreadyviolated in the existing system—may bethe only way ofimproving electricity ser-vices to the poor.•Third,better information—that makescitizens more aware ofthe money allo-cated to their services,the actual condi-tions ofservices,and the behavior ofpolicymakers and providers—can be apowerful force in overcoming clientelistpolitics.The role ofa free and vibrantpress and improving the level ofpublicdiscourse cannot be overstated.12WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Pro-poor?noyes02_WDR_Overview.qxd  8/14/03  7:27 AM  Page 12(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Homogeneous or heterogeneousclients?The answer to this question depends on theservice.Students with disabilities have specialneeds for quality education but not forimmunization.Heterogeneity is also deﬁnedby regional or community preferences.Whether a girl goes to school may depend onwhether there are separate latrines for boysand girls.Ifthat depends on local preferences,the village should have a say in design.Previ-ously homogeneous societies,such as Swedenand Norway,are changing with increasedimmigration.They are giving more discre-tion to local communities in tailoring theeducation system to suit the linguistic abili-ties oftheir members.The more that people differ in theirdesires,the greater the beneﬁts from decen-tralizing the decision.In the most extremecase—when individual preferences matter—the appropriate solution will involve individ-ual choices ofservice (ifthere is the possibil-ity ofcompetition) and such interventions ascash transfers,vouchers,or capitation pay-ments to schools or medical providers.Ifthere are shared preferences,as in education,or free-rider problems as in sanitation,thecommunity is the correct locus ofdecision-making.The appropriate policy will theninvolve local-government decisions in adecentralized setting—or depending onpolitical realities,community decisions (asfor social investment funds) and user groups(such as parents in school committees).Easy or hard to monitor?Services can be distinguished by the difﬁcultyofmonitoring service outputs.The difﬁcultydepends on the service and on the institu-tional capacity ofgovernment to do the mon-itoring.At one extreme are the services ofteachers in a classroom or doctors in a clinic.Both transactions allow much discretion bythe provider that cannot be observed easily.Adoctor has much more discretion in treatinga patient than an electrician switching on apower grid.And it is difﬁcult to know whenhigh-quality teaching or health care is beingprovided.It may be possible to test students.But test scores tell very little about theteacher’s ability or effort,since they depend atleast as much on students’socioeconomicstatus or parental involvement.More easilymonitored are immunizations and cleanlatrines—all measurable by a quantitative,observable indicator.Ofcourse it depends on who is doing themonitoring.Parents can observe whether theteacher is in attendance,and what their chil-dren are learning,more easily than some cen-tral education authority.Better managementinformation systems and e-government canmake certain services easier to monitor.Andmonitoring costs can be reduced by judiciouschoice ofproviders—such as some NGOs,which may be trustworthy without formalmonitoring.In short,the difﬁculty ofmoni-toring is not ﬁxed:it can vary over time andwith policies.Eight sizes ﬁt all Now examine different combinations ofthese characteristics,to see which servicedelivery arrangement would be a good ﬁt—and which would be a misﬁt (ﬁgure 7).To besure,none ofthe characteristics can be easilydivided into such clean categories,becausecountries and services lie on a continuum.Even so,by dividing the salient characteris-tics,and looking at various combinations,the“eight sizes ﬁt all”approach can be applied tothe considerations spelled out earlier.Central government ﬁnancing with con-tracting (1).In a favorable political context,with agreement on what government shoulddo,an easy-to-monitor service such asimmunization could be delivered by thepublic sector,or ﬁnanced by the public sec-tor and contracted out to the private or non-proﬁt sector,as with primary health centersin Cambodia.35Infrastructure services couldbe managed by a national utility or providedby the private sector with regulatory over-sight.Note that the particular conﬁguration inwhich this arrangement will work is special.In the developed countries there is muchdiscussion ofa set ofreforms,started in NewZealand,that involve greater use ofexplicitcontracts—either from the government tothe private sector,or from central ministriesto the ministries responsible for speciﬁc ser-vices.The New Zealand reforms are justiﬁedby a well-established public sector ethos,Overview13Pro-poor?Homogeneous?yesnoHomogeneous?yesnonoyes02_WDR_Overview.qxd  8/14/03  7:27 AM  Page 13(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

14WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004reasonable management information sys-tems,and supporting institutions,includinglegal systems,to allow contract enforcement.These features increase the “monitorability”ofcertain services by reducing the gapbetween contracted and realized outcomes.These preconditions do not exist in manydeveloping countries,so the template ofthesereforms cannot be used mechanically.36Ifthere is no good legal system and the civil ser-vice is subject to bribes (a form ofclientelistpolitics),private sector contracts might be amajor source ofcorruption.In these coun-tries,government should perhaps be evenmore output-oriented—not as a means oftweaking a well-functioning system but as away ofgetting the system to provide muchgreater improvements in services and gener-ating new information.Central government provision (2).When theservice is difﬁcult to monitor—explicit con-tracts are difﬁcult to write or enforce—butthe politics are pro-poor and clients homo-geneous,the traditional,centralized publicsector is the appropriate delivery system.The French education system,which admin-isters a uniform service centrally,is one ofthe best examples.37But too many countriesfall into the trap ofthinking that justbecause the service is difﬁcult to monitor,itmust be delivered by the government.Whenstudents are heterogeneous,when the poli-tics ofthe country are not geared towardpoor people,government control oftheeducation system—with no participation bystudents,parents,or local communities—can leave the poor worse off.Local government ﬁnancing with contracting(3).With heterogeneous preferences,localgovernments should be involved in services.When local politics are pro-poor (butnational politics aren’t),local governmentscould be more reliable ﬁnanciers ofservices,and vice versa.Easily monitored services suchas water or electricity can be contracted out topublic or private utilities,as in Johannesburg.Local government (or deconcentrated cen-tral government) provision (4).For difﬁcult-to-monitor services,such as education (forquality),management responsibility mightbe ceded to parent groups when the politicsare conducive,as in the Educo program.Giving clients a choice through vouchersenables them to express their heterogeneouspreferences.And the competition created byclients having a choice may improve servicequality—as with water vouchers in Chile orsanitation vouchers in Bangladesh.Client power (5,6,7,8).When publiclyﬁnanced services are subject to capture—thepolitics are not pro-poor—the best thing todo is to strengthen the client’s power asmuch as possible.But that can be difﬁcult.Even means-tested voucher schemes or sub-sidies could be diverted to the non-poor.Transparent,rule-based programs,such asProgresa in Mexico,are needed to make itdifﬁcult to hide middle-class capture.In services such as water and electricity,governments intervene to regulate monopolyproviders and protect the poor—and notFigure 7Eight sizes ﬁt all?Central governmentfinancing with contracting1Central government provision2Local government financing withcontracting3Local government provision4Client power—experiment withcontracts5Client power—experiment withself-monitoring providers6Client power—experiment withcommunity control, vouchers7Client power—imitate market8yesnoPro-poor?Homogeneous ?yesnoHomogeneous ?yesnonoyesyesnoyesnoyesnoEasytomonitor?Easytomonitor?Easytomonitor?Easytomonitor?02_WDR_Overview.qxd  8/14/03  7:28 AM  Page 14(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

because there are signiﬁcant externalities.Soseparating the policymaker from the provider,and making the provider accountable to theclient through prices,can strengthen clientpower and lead to better results.Poor peoplecan be protected from high prices ifchargesrise with use (with an initial,free amount).Allowing small,independent water providersto compete with the local monopoly can alsodiscipline provision and keep prices down.But prices—without accompanying subsi-dies or transfers to poor people—cannot beused to strengthen client power in educationbecause ofthe externalities in primary educa-tion.A market-based allocation would not bein society’s interest.The same applies tohealth services with externalities,such asimmunization.In curative health care,theasymmetry ofinformation between clientand provider makes strengthening clientpower problematic.Better information onpreventive care or on how to choose medicalproviders (possibly disseminated by non-proﬁt organizations) can ameliorate theproblem.In extreme cases,it may be that onlycommunity groups or altruistic nonproﬁtscan effectively provide these services to poorpeople.38These service delivery arrangements repre-sent efforts to balance problems with the longroute ofaccountability (clientelist politics,hard-to-monitor services) with the shortroute.The reason societies choose the longroute is that there are market failures orconcerns with equity that make the tradi-tional short route—consumers’power overproviders—inadequate.But the “governmentfailures”associated with the long route may beso severe that,in some cases,the market solu-tion may actually leave poor people better off.Eight sizes ﬁt all with adjustablewaistbandsThe foregoing simpliﬁed scheme capturesonly part ofthe story.At least two features areleft out.Failed states.Countries where the state is fail-ing (often countries in conﬂict) need servicedelivery arrangements different from thosewhere the state is fairly strong.Primary schoolcompletion rates in Senegal and the Democ-ratic Republic ofCongo are about 40 percent.In Senegal—a stable democracy—the reformsin education,including those that strengthenclient-provider links,would go through thegovernment (to strengthen the policymaker-provider links as well).In the DemocraticRepublic ofCongo—where conﬂict has sig-niﬁcantly weakened the state—ways shouldbe found to empower communities toimprove education services—even ifit meansbypassing government ministries in the shortto medium term.Social funds and commu-nity-driven development are examples.Theycan be effective in improving service out-comes,but concerns about their sustainabilityand scalability—and whether they crowd outthe growth oflocal government capacity—should not be overlooked.History.The country’s history can also havea bearing on which service delivery arrange-ments are likely to succeed.Until the 19thcentury,the education systems ofBritainand France were private and the church wasthe dominant provider.The governmenthad an incentive to develop an oversightmechanism to ensure that the schoolstaught more than just religion.That provedvaluable when education was nationalizedin these countries:the systems continued torun with strong regulatory oversight.Water providers in the Netherlands startedas private companies,making the concept ofwater as an economic good,and charging forit,acceptable.When the system was shifted tomunicipal ownership,pricing remained.Evenifthe Dutch never introduce private participa-tion in water,they have achieved the separa-tion between policymaker and provider.Insum,a country’s history can generate theincentives for certain institutions to develop—and those institutions can make the differencein whether a particular service arrangementsucceeds or fails.Sectoral service reformsWhat do these conclusions tell us about thereform agenda in individual sectors? In edu-cationthere is a tradeoffbetween the needfor greater central authority to capture soci-etywide beneﬁts,such as social cohesion,and the need for greater local inﬂuencebecause student learning is difﬁcult tomonitor at the central level.The tradeoffisOverview1502_WDR_Overview.qxd  8/14/03  7:28 AM  Page 15(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

16WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004sharper when the concern is the quality ofeducation rather than the quantity.InIndonesia centralized public delivery ofeducation has enrolled children in schools,but it has been less successful in teachingthem valuable skills.To increase the qualityofeducation,therefore,reforms shouldconcentrate on increasing the voice andparticipation ofclients—but not neglectthe importance ofcentral government over-sight.In practical terms,this would call formore community management ofschoolsand demand-side subsidies to poor people,but with continuing stress on nationallydetermined curricula and certiﬁcation.Governments intervene in healthto con-trol communicable diseases,protect poorpeople from impoverishing health expendi-tures,and disseminate information abouthome-based health and nutrition practices.Each ofthese activities is different,yet theyare often provided by the same arrangement,such as a central government public healthsystem.They should be differentiated.•Information about hand washing,exclu-sive breastfeeding,and nutrition can bedelivered (and even ﬁnanced) by NGOsand other groups,delivery that worksbest when reinforced by the community.•Outreach services,such as immuniza-tions,can be contracted out but shouldbe publicly ﬁnanced.•Clinical care is the service the client isleast able to monitor,but the case inwhich government failures might swampmarket failures.Where the politics areextremely pro-rich,even public ﬁnanc-ing ofthese services (with private provi-sion) can be counterproductive for poorpeople.The non-poor can capture thisﬁnancing,leaving no curative servicesfor the poor—and no room in the bud-get for public health services.Strength-ening client power,through eitherdemand-side subsidies or co-payments,can improve matters for poor people,even ifthere is asymmetric informationbetween client and provider.In the infrastructuresectors—such aswater,sanitation,transport,and energy—therationale for government intervention is dif-ferent from that in education and health,andso should be the policy responses.The mainreason for government involvement in waterand energy provision is that those services areprovided through networks,so direct compe-tition is not possible.Governments also inter-vene to ensure access by poor people to theseservices.So the role ofgovernment is to regu-late and in some cases subsidize productionand distribution.There are few advantages tothe government’s providing the service itself,which explains why the past decade has seenmany privatizations,concessions,and the likein water and energy.Whether delivered by a private or publiccompany,the service needs to be regulated.Who that regulator is will determine serviceoutcomes.At the very least,when the com-pany is public,the regulator should be sepa-rate from the provider (when the policy-maker and provider are indistinguishable,making this separation is all the more difﬁ-cult).The situation is worse when water orenergy is subsidized,because the sizable rentsfrom this subsidy—the beneﬁts ofbelow-market-rate services—can be captured bypoliticians,who use them to curry favor withtheir rich clients rather than the poor.Sanitation is different because individualscan ofﬂoad their refuse onto their neighbors.So subsidies to individual households willnot solve the collective action problem.Instead,using community-level subsidies,and giving communities the authority toallocate them,puts the locus ofauthoritywhere the external effects ofindividualbehavior can be contained.Scaling upHow can all these reforms be scaled up sothat developing countries will have a chanceIn addition to the usual assortment of boxes andexamples to illustrate particular points,thisReport contains 11 “spotlights”that appearbetween chapters.Each spotlight describes aparticularly important service delivery innova-tion or experience.The purpose of these spot-lights is to tell the story behind theseinnovations or experiences,and provide a bal-anced perspective on the evidence.BOX 3Spotlight on “spotlights”02_WDR_Overview.qxd  8/14/03  7:29 AM  Page 16(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Overview17ofmeeting the Millennium DevelopmentGoals? First,as noted at the beginning ofthisReport,additional resources—external andinternal—will be needed to capitalize onthese reforms.Second,these reforms must beembedded in a public sector responsible forensuring poor people’s access to basic ser-vices.This means that the sectoral reformsmust be linked to ongoing (or nascent) pub-lic sector reforms in such areas as budgetmanagement,decentralization,and publicadministration reform.It also means that awell-functioning public sector is a crucialunderpinning ofservice delivery reform.Inthe same vein,there should be reform indonor practices—such as harmonizing pro-cedures and making more use ofbudgetsupport—to strengthen recipient countries’efforts to improve service outputs.Third,a recurring theme in this Report iswhat information can do—as a stimulant forpublic action,as a catalyst for change,and asan input for making other reforms work.Even in the most resistant societies,the cre-ation and dissemination ofinformation canbe accelerated.Surveys ofthe quality ofser-vice delivery conducted by the Public AffairsCentre in Bangalore,India,have increasedpublic demand for service reform.The sur-veys have been replicated in 24 Indian states.The public expenditure tracking survey inUganda is another example,as is the Probereport on India’s education system.Beyond surveys,the widespread and sys-tematic evaluation ofservice delivery can havea profound effect on progress toward the Mil-lennium Development Goals.Evaluationsbased on random assignments,such as Mex-ico’s Progresa,or other rigorous evaluationsgive conﬁdence to policymakers and the pub-lic that what they are seeing is real.Govern-ments are constantly trying new approachesto service delivery.Some ofthem work.Butunless there is some systematic evaluation ofthese programs,there is no certainty that theyworked because ofthe program or for otherreasons.Based on the systematic evaluationsofProgresa,the government has scaled up theprogram to encompass 20 percent oftheMexican people.The beneﬁts ofsystematic program evalua-tion go beyond the program and the country.These evaluations tell policymakers in othercountries what works and what doesn’t.Theyare global public goods—which might explainwhy they are so scarce.39Ifthese evaluationsare global public goods,the international com-munity should ﬁnance them.One possibilitywould be to protect the 1.5 percent ofWorldBank loans that is supposed to be used forevaluation (but rarely is),so that this sum—about $300 million a year—could be used toadminister rigorous evaluations ofprojectsand disseminate the results worldwide.In addition to creating and disseminatinginformation,other reforms to improve servicedelivery will require careful consideration ofthe particular setting.There is no silver bulletto improve service delivery.It may be knownhow to educate a child or stop an infant fromdying.But institutions are needed that willeducate a generation ofchildren or reduceinfant mortality by two-thirds.These do notcrop up overnight.Nor will a single institu-tional arrangement generate the desiredresults.Everything from publicly ﬁnancedcentral government provision to user-ﬁnanced community provision can work (orfail to work) in different circumstances.Rather than prescribe policies or designthe optimal institution,this Reportdescribes the incentives that will give rise tothe appropriate institution in a given con-text.Decentralization may not be the opti-mal institutional design.But it may givelocal governments the incentives to buildregulatory capacity that,in turn,could makewater and energy services work better forpoor people.NGO service provision mightbe effective in the medium run,as it hasbeen in education in Bangladesh.But theincentives it creates for the public sector tostay out ofeducation make it much harderto scale up or improve quality—as Ban-gladesh is discovering today.Many oftheseinstitutions cut across the public sector—budgetary institutions,intergovernmentalrelations,the civil service—which reinforcesthe notion that service delivery reformshould be embedded in the context ofpublicsector reformIn addition to looking for incentives togenerate the appropriate institutions,gov-ernments should be more selective in whatthey choose to do.The experience with ser-vice delivery teaches us the importance of02_WDR_Overview.qxd  8/14/03  7:29 AM  Page 17(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

18WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004implementation.Singapore and Nigeria(both former British colonies) have similarlydesigned education systems.But in imple-mentation,the outcomes,especially for poorpeople,could not be more different.Govern-ments and donors often overlook implemen-tation difﬁculties when designing policies.There may be beneﬁts to having the centralgovernment administer schools (such associal cohesion).But the problems with cen-tral provision ofa hard-to-monitor activitysuch as primary education are so great,espe-cially among heterogeneous populations,thatthe government should rethink its position ofcentrally controlled schools.Selectivity is notjust about choosing from the available designoptions—it is about choosing with an eyetoward options that can be implemented.That there is no silver bullet,that weshould be looking for incentives that giverise to appropriate institutions,that weneed to be more realistic about implemen-tation in choosing among options—allimply that these reforms will take time.Even ifwe know what is to be done,it maybe difﬁcult to get it done.Despite the urgentneeds ofthe world’s poor people,and themany ways services have failed them,quickresults will be hard to come by.Many ofthechanges involve fundamental shifts inpower—something that cannot happenovernight.Making services work for poorpeople requires patience.But that does notmean we should be complacent.HubertLyautey,the French marshal,once asked hisgardener how long a tree would take toreach maturity.When the gardeneranswered that it would take 100 years,Mar-shal Lyautey replied,“In that case,plant itthis afternoon.”02_WDR_Overview.qxd  8/14/03  7:30 AM  Page 18(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

19With seven other children to care for,Maria’smother,Antonia Souza Lima,explained that shecould not afford the time—an hour-and-a-halfwalk—or the 40-cent bus fare to take her listlessbaby to the nearest medical post.Maria seemeddestined to become one ofthe 250,000 Brazilianchildren who die every year before turning 5.Butin a new effort to cut the devastating infant mor-tality rate here,a community health workerrecently started to walk weekly to the Lima house-hold,bringing oral rehydration formula for Mariaand hygiene advice for her mother,who has a tele-vision set but no water ﬁlter.Once a month,the7,240 workers in the Ceará health program enterthe homes offour million people,the poor major-ity ofa state where most people’s incomes are lessthan $1 a day.Erismar Rodrigues de Lima,aneighbor ofthe Limas,listened intently to instruc-tions on ﬁltering drinking water.“I am the ﬁrstmember ofmy family to ever receive prenatalcare,”said the 22-year-old woman,who is expect-ing a baby in June.From the New York Times40I go to collect water four times a day,in a 20-litreclay jar.It’s hard work! ...I’ve never been toschool as I have to help my mother with her wash-ing work so we can earn enough money.I alsohave to help with the cooking,go to the market tobuy food,and collect twigs and rubbish for thecooking ﬁre.Our house doesn’t have a bathroom.Iwash myselfin the kitchen once a week,on Sun-day.At the same time I change my clothes andwash the dirty ones.When I need the toilet I haveto go down to the river in the gully behind myhouse.I usually go with my friends as we’re onlysupposed to go after dark when people can’t see us.In the daytime I use a tin inside the house andempty it out later.IfI could alter my life,I wouldreally like to go to school and have more clothes.Elma Kassa,a 13-year-old girl from Addis Ababa,Ethiopia41Citizens and governments can make servicesthat contribute to human development workbetter for poor people—and in many casesthey have.But too often services fail poorpeople.Services are failing because they arefalling short oftheir potential to improveoutcomes.They are often inaccessible or pro-hibitively expensive.But even when accessi-ble,they are often dysfunctional,extremelylow in technical quality,and unresponsive tothe needs ofa diverse clientele.In addition,innovation and evaluation—to ﬁnd ways toincrease productivity—are rare.Many services contribute to improvinghuman welfare,but this Report focuses onservices that contribute directly to improvinghealth and education outcomes—health ser-vices,education services,and such infrastruc-ture services as water,sanitation,and energy.“Services”include what goes on in schools,clinics,and hospitals and what teachers,nurses,and doctors do.They also includehow textbooks,drugs,safe water,and elec-tricity reach poor people,and what informa-tion campaigns and cash transfers can do toenable poor people to improve outcomesdirectly.Much ofall this is relevant for othersectors,such as police services,so the Reportfeatures examples from those sectors as well.Just how bad can services be? Testimoniesshow that they can be very bad.In Adaboya,Ghana,poor people say that their “childrenmust walk four kilometers to attend schoolbecause,while there is a school building inthe village,it sits in disrepair and cannot beused in the rainy season.”42In Potrero Sula,ElSalvador,villagers complain that “the healthpost here is useless because there is no doctoror nurse,and it is only open two days a weekuntil noon.”43A common response in a clientsurvey by women who had given birth atrural health centers in the Mutasa district ofZimbabwe is that they were hit by staffdur-ing delivery.44This chapter illustrates many types offailures—inaccessible or unaffordable ser-vices,and various shortfalls in quality—usingtestimonials from poor people,compilationsServices can work for poor people but too often they fail1chapter03_WDR_Ch01.qxd  8/14/03  7:33 AM  Page 19(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

ofdata from several countries,and in-depthstudies.The chapter also provides examplesofservices that are working for poor people.Learning from success and understanding thesources offailure require a framework foranalysis.Chapters 3 to 6 ofthe Report presentand develop that framework;Chapters 7 to11 consider options and issues for reform.Outcomes are substantiallyworse for poor peopleJust how bad are outcomes? Rates ofillnessand death are high—and rates ofschoolenrollment,completion,and learning arelow—especially for poor people (box 1.1).InCambodia under-ﬁve mortality is 147 per1,000 births among the poorest ﬁfth ofthepopulation;in Armenia it is 63 (ﬁgure 1.1).45Many children are unlikely to complete evenprimary schooling.Among adolescents 15 to19 years old in Egypt,only 60 percent in thepoorest ﬁfth have completed the ﬁve years ofprimary school (ﬁgure 1.2).In Peru only 67percent ofyouths in the poorest ﬁfth haveﬁnished the six-year primary cycle,eventhough almost all started school.In bothcountries nearly all adolescents in the richestﬁfth ofthe population completed primaryschool.46These countries are not specialcases.Worldwide more than 100 million chil-dren ofprimary school age are not in pri-mary school.47Almost 11 million children,roughly the population ofGreece or Mali,diebefore their ﬁfth birthday.48Most countries have rich-poor differen-tials in education or health outcomes.This isnot necessarily evidence ofservices failingpoor people—there are many determinantsofoutcomes (see crate 1.1 at the end ofthischapter).49Comparing outcomes for richerand poorer people within countries high-lights two things.First,it shows the absolutelybad outcomes among the poor—for exam-ple,in Bolivia 143 children ofevery 1,000from the poorest quintile died before theirﬁfth birthday,and in Niger fewer than 10 per-cent ofadolescents from the poorest quintilecompleted grade 6.Second,within-countrycomparisons give a sense ofthe possible—that is,speciﬁc goals already being reachedwithin a country.Affordable access to services islow—especially for poor peopleIn many ofthe poorest countries,access toschools,health clinics,clean water,sanitation20WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Deﬁning who is “poor”is always a difﬁcult proposi-tion because there are several concepts of poverty.Perhaps most familiar is the one used to identify thepoor in sample surveys in low-income countries:thatis based on a composite measure of total householdconsumption per member (with adjustments forhousehold size and composition).50“Poor people”are then deﬁned as those living in households belowa particular threshold of this measure of consump-tion,such as below $1 or $2 a day,or below a nation-ally deﬁned level.An alternative approach divides the populationinto various groups,for example,quintiles,accordingto a ranked ordering of the measure.The poorestquintile or poorest ﬁfth,for example,is the 20 per-cent of people who live in households with the low-est values of the consumption measure.Many surveys,including some used in thisReport,do not include consumption data,whichare difﬁcult to collect.One approach to assigningpeople to quintiles is to aggregate indicators of ahousehold’s asset ownership and housing charac-teristics into an index,and then to rank householdsaccording to this index.To distinguish theseapproaches in this Report,quintiles based on thelatter method are typically referred to as “asset”or“wealth”quintiles (since asset ownership and hous-ing characteristics are arguably reﬂections of ahousehold’s wealth).51But poverty based on consumption,“wealth,”oran alternative derived from income,is not the onlysocial disadvantage that creates difﬁculties in thedemand for and provision of services.Gender canexclude women from both household and publicdemands for better services.In many countries eth-nicity or other socially constructed categories of dis-advantage are important barriers.People with physi-cal and mental disabilities are often notaccommodated by education and health services.Even broader concepts of poverty are relevant toeffective services.“Poor people”include people expe-riencing any of the many dimensions of poverty—and those vulnerable or at risk of poverty—in low-income and lower middle-income countries.52Sopoor people can be seen as the “working class,”or“popular”in Spanish,or simply just “not rich.”Even inmiddle-income countries the “poor”includes a largepart of the population:much of the population can-not insulate itself from the consequences of failuresof public services.BOX 1.1Who are “poor people”?Figure 1.1Child mortality issubstantially higher in poorhouseholdsDeaths per 1,000 live births050100150200Armenia 2000050100150200Central African Republic 1994–95050100150200Bolivia 1997050100150200Cambodia 2000Under age 5Under age 1Poorest fifth18914314763Richest fifthNote: Fifths based on asset index quintiles.Source: Analysis of Demographic and HealthSurvey data.03_WDR_Ch01.qxd  8/14/03  7:33 AM  Page 20(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

and hire more teachers.Primary enrollmentdoubled between 1973 and 1986,reaching 90percent—though the story on quality is lesspositive.58Despite a limited budget El Sal-vador expanded access to schooling in poorrural communities after a civil war in the1980s by using innovative institutionalarrangements (see Educo spotlight).The exact relationship between use ofser-vices and prices or family income varies,butfor poor people,lower incomes and higherprices are associated with less use.59Poor peo-ple spend a lot oftheir money on services:75percent ofall health spending in low-incomecountries is private,50 percent in middle-income countries.60Based on governmentsources,these broad aggregates are probablyunderestimates,hiding the heavier burden onpoor people.And poor people often need topay more for the same goods.For example,poor people often pay higher prices to watersellers than the better-offpay to utilities(chapter 9).In Ghana the approximate pricepaid per liter for water purchased by thebucket was between 5 and 16 times higherthan the charge for public supply,eventhough women and children often had towalk a long distance to purchase the water.InPune,India,low-income purchasers ofwaterpaid up to 30 times the sale price ofthemetered water that middle- and upper-income households used.61The poor also lack the collateral needed toformally borrow to pay for expensive servicesfor which they lack insurance,and thereforeresort to informal moneylenders who chargevery high interest rates.Ifthis ﬁnancingchannel is unavailable,they use more expen-sive traditional or private providers whooften provide more ﬂexibility in the terms ofpayment.62This need not be.In Egypt making healthinsurance available to school children in theearly 1990s almost doubled the probability ofahealth facility visit among the poorest ﬁfth ofthe population,substantially reducing therich-poor gap.63In Mexico an innovative pro-gram—Progresa—provided parents with cashtransfers ifthey attended health education lec-tures (where they also received nutrition sup-plements),and family members got regularmedical checkups.The impact ofthis combi-nation ofhigher income and facility visits wasServices can work for poor people but too often they fail21Egypt 2000012345678940208060100Niger 1998012345678940208060100India 1998–99012345GradeGradeGrade678940208060100Richest fifth36%6.4%60%012345678940208060100Peru 2000Grade67%Poorest fifthNotes:The grade number boldfaced denotes theend of the primary cycle.

Punjab,Pakistan,only about 5 percent ofsickchildren were taken for treatment to ruralprimary health care facilities;halfwent toprivate dispensaries,and the others to privatedoctors.66When quality improves,thedemand for services increases—even amongpoor clients.67Services are often dysfunctionalEnsuring that positions are ﬁlled,that staffreport for work,and that they are responsiveto all their clients is a major challenge.Themore skilled the workers,the less likely theyare to accept a job as a teacher or a healthworker in a remote area.A recent study inBangladesh found 40 percent vacancy ratesfor doctor postings in poor areas.68In PapuaNew Guinea,with a substantial percentage ofteaching positions unﬁlled,many schoolsclosed because they could not get teachers.69Incentive payments might encourage profes-sionals to work in remote areas,but they can22WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004signiﬁcant:illnesses among children under ﬁvefell by about 20 percent (see spotlight).Quality—a range of failuresLack ofaccess and unaffordability are just twoways services fail.In low- and middle-incomecountries alike,ifservices are available at allthey are often oflow quality.So,many poorpeople bypass the closest public facility to goto more costly private facilities or choose bet-ter quality at more distant public facilities.Anin-depth study ofthe Iringa district in Tanza-nia,a poor rural area,showed that patientsbypassed low-quality facilities in favor ofthose offering high-quality consultations andprescriptions,staffed by more knowledgeablephysicians,and better stocked with basic sup-plies.64A study in Sri Lanka found similarbehavior,with patient demand for qualityvarying with the severity ofthe illness.65One result:underused publicly fundedclinics.In the Sheikhupura district ofruralTable 1.1The nearest school or health center can be quite farMean distance to nearest facility in rural areas among the poorest and richest wealth quintiles in 19 developingcountriesGNI per Distance to the nearest Distance to the nearest  capitaprimary school (kilometers)medical facility (kilometers)Poorest Richest RatioPoorest Richest RatioﬁfthﬁfthﬁfthﬁfthBangladesh 1996–973740.20.11.60.90.71.3Benin 19963951.50.0—7.52.82.7Bolivia 1993–9410041.20.0—11.82.06.0Burkina Faso 1992–933362.90.83.97.82.63.0Central African Republic 1994–958196.70.88.914.77.71.9Cameroon 19916112.60.73.87.05.41.3Chad 19982509.91.37.622.94.84.8Côte d’Ivoire 19947881.40.0—10.53.43.1Dominican Rep. 199112610.60.41.36.31.35.0Haiti 1994–953362.20.36.48.01.17.2India 1998–994620.50.22.32.50.73.6Madagascar 19923030.60.31.815.54.73.3Mali 1995–962817.95.21.513.66.72.0Morocco 199213883.70.313.113.54.72.9Niger 19982172.21.51.526.99.72.8Nigeria 19992661.80.35.511.61.67.1Senegal 1992–939333.82.31.712.810.01.3Tanzania 1991–922241.20.61.94.73.01.6Uganda 19952901.40.91.54.73.21.5Zimbabwe 19947533.03.50.88.66.31.4Note: Gross national income (GNI) per capita is that at the time of the survey, expressed in 2001 dollars.

be expensive.A study in Indonesia estimatedthat doctors would need to be paid severaltimes their current salaries to induce them togo to the most remote areas.70Even when positions are ﬁlled,staffabsence rates can be high.In random visits to200 primary schools in India,investigatorsfound no teaching activity in halfofthem atthe time ofvisit.71Recent random samples ofschools and health clinics in several develop-ing countries found absence rates over 40 per-cent,with higher rates in remote areas and forsome kinds ofstaff—although there is widevariation within countries (tables 1.2 and1.3).Earlier studies have found similar results.Up to 45 percent ofteachers in Ethiopia wereabsent at least one day in the week before avisit—10 percent ofthem for three days ormore.72Health workers in rural health centersin Honduras worked only 77 percent ofthepossible days in the week before a visit.73Inrural Côte d’Ivoire only 75 percent ofdoctorswere in attendance on the day before a visit.74Staffalone cannot ensure high-qualityservices.They also need the right materials—books in schools,drugs in clinics.Studies inGhana and Nigeria in the early 1990s foundServices can work for poor people but too often they fail23Many countries lack reliable data on AIDS-relateddeaths and HIV prevalence among teachers,butthe available information suggests rising teachermortality in the presence of HIV/AIDS.For example:In the Central African Republic 85 percent ofteachers who died between 1996 and1998 were HIV-positive.On average theydied 10 years before they were due toretire.In Zambia 1,300 teachers died in the ﬁrst 10months of 1998,compared with 680teachers in 1996.In Kenya teacher deaths rose from 450 in1995 to 1,500 in 1999 (reported by theTeaching Service Commission),while inone of Kenya’s eight provinces 20 to 30teachers die each month from AIDS.HIV-positive teachers are estimated at morethan 30 percent in parts of Malawi andUganda,20 percent in Zambia,and 12percent in South Africa.Sources:Coombe (2000),Gachuhi (1999),Kelly(1999),Kelly (2000),UNAIDS (2000),World Bank(2002h).BOX 1.2HIV/AIDS is killingteachersFigure 1.3Water, water everywhere, nor any drop to drinkPercent of households who use an improved water source, poorest and richestﬁfths Note:The poorest ﬁfth in one country may correspond to the standard of living in the middle ﬁfth inanother country.

that about 30 percent ofpublic clinics lackeddrugs.75A quarter ofrural clinics in Côted’Ivoire had no antibiotics.76By itself,theavailability ofdrugs in a health facility is anambiguous measure ofquality:stockoutscould be caused by high demand.But whenmedicines are lacking in clinics and availableon the black market,as is often the case,some-thing is amiss.Educational materials are simi-larly lacking in schools.In Nepal a study foundas many as six students sharing local-languagetextbooks.In Madagascar textbooks had to beshared by three to ﬁve students,and only halfthe classrooms had a usable chalk board.77When staffreport to work—as many doconscientiously—and when complementaryinputs are available,service quality will sufferiffacilities are inadequate or in disrepair.Conditions can be horriﬁc.An account ofaschool in north Bihar in India describes class-rooms “...close to disintegration.Six chil-dren were injured in three separate incidentswhen parts ofthe building fell down,andeven now there is an acute danger ofterminalcollapse....The playground is full ofmuckand slime.The overﬂowing drains could eas-ily drown a small child.Mosquitoes areswarming.There is no toilet.Neighbors com-plain ofchildren using any convenient placeto relieve themselves,and teachers complainofneighbors using the playground as a toiletin the morning.”78The same study in Indiafound that halfthe schools visited had nodrinking water available.In rural areas ofBangladesh and Nepal a study found an aver-age ofone toilet for 90 students,halfofthemnot usable.79In Pakistan there were no sepa-rate toilet facilities for girls in 16 percent ofschools visited in one study.80Another problem is corruption in variousforms.Teachers and principals might solicitbribes to admit students or give better grades,or they might teach poorly to increase thedemand for private tuition after hours.Sur-veys in 11 Eastern and Central Europeancountries found that the health sector wasconsidered one ofthe most corrupt.81Ofﬁ-cially only 24 percent ofhealth spending inEurope and Central Asia is estimated to beprivate,but this fails to include the informalpayments—gratuities and bribes—that manypatients pay.More than 70 percent ofpatientsmake such payments in Azerbaijan,Poland,and the Russian Federation—more than 90percent in Armenia.82Corruption hurts patients elsewhere too.For example,studies based on data from themid-1990s found that informal paymentssubstantially increased the price ofhealth ser-vices in Guinea and Uganda.83A recentreview ofcase studies in Latin America foundwidespread corruption in hospitals,rangingfrom theft and absenteeism to kickbacks forprocurement.84Villagers in one NorthAfrican country where people are covered by“free medical care”reported in a discussiongroup that “there isn’t a single tablet in theclinic and the doctor has turned it into hisprivate clinic.”85Again,this need not be.In Benin cost-sharing in health clinics—in line with theBamako Initiative—and revolving drug-funds increased the availability ofdrugs inclinics that previously provided services freebut almost never had any drugs.Useincreased in all the clinics that introducedthese measures (see spotlight).86Innovativearrangements can encourage teachers toreport for work.In Nicaragua between 1995and 1997 teacher attendance increased bytwice as much in primary schools that weregranted autonomy as in state schools man-aged through the bureaucratic system.87InIndia a large-scale basic education programin the 1990s doubled the toilets and drinkingwater facilities in schools in districts where itwas implemented.Stakeholders can mobilizeto reduce corruption.Public sector unionshave organized an anticorruption network(UNICORN) that is supporting national ini-tiatives to protect whistleblowers.The technical quality ofservices isoften very lowServices also fail poor people when technicalquality is low—that is,when inputs are com-bined in ways that produce outcomes in inef-ﬁcient,ineffective,or harmful ways.Forexample,health workers with low skills givethe wrong medical advice or procedure,orschools use ineffective teaching methods.Gross inefﬁciency was identiﬁed as the reasonfor soaring expenditures in a hospital in theDominican Republic.88A multicountry studyofhealth facilities in the mid-1990s foundshockingly low cases ofproper assessments of24WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Table 1.2Staff are often absentAbsence rates among teachers and health care workers in public facilities (percent) Primary Primary schoolshealth facilitiesBangladesh—35Ecuador16—India*2543Indonesia1842Papua New Guinea1519Peru1326Zambia17—Uganda2635*Average for 14 states.

diarrhea in children under ﬁve,and evenfewer cases correctly treated or advised.Forexample,in Zambia only 30 percent ofcaseswere correctly assessed,and only 19 percentcorrectly rehydrated.89Another study inEgypt found only 14 percent ofacute cases ofdiarrhea were treated appropriately with oralrehydration salts.90A recent study in Beninfound that one in four sick children receivedunnecessary or dangerous drugs from healthworkers.91In India the contamination ofinjection needles used by registered medicalpractitioners was alarmingly widespread.92Even though technical quality is more dif-ﬁcult to identify in basic education,someindicators raise alarm.For example,spendingis ineffectively allocated,with substantiallymore going to teacher salaries relative to otherfactors that would be more efﬁcient.93Or timeis misspent:in ﬁve Middle Eastern and NorthAfrican countries primary school studentsspend only about 65 percent ofthe potentialtime actually on task.94In Indonesia ﬁrst andsecond grade students ofﬁcially spend only2.5 hours a day in school,and absences andclassroom time spent on administrative tasksreduced time spent learning even further.95Services are not responsive to clientsServices also fail in the interaction betweenprovider and client.Clients are diverse:theydiffer by economic status,religion,ethnicity,gender,marital status,age,social status,caste.They may also differ in the constraints ontheir time,their access to information andsocial networks,or their civic skills and abilityto act collectively.The inequalities betweenthese groups are mirrored in the relationshipbetween clients and providers.96In India dis-tricts with a higher proportion oflower castesand some religious groups have fewer doctorsand nurses per capita,and health outreachworkers are less likely to visit lower-caste andpoor households.97Clients report that theyvalue health facilities that are open at conve-nient times,with staffwho treat them withrespect.In El Salvador infrequent and incon-venient operating hours greatly reduced theuse ofhealth posts.According to focus grouprespondents:“Health posts operate onlytwice a week.Waiting time is three hours onaverage.Only those who arrive by 8 a.m.get aconsultation.”98In Sub-Saharan Africa schooloften starts at 8 a.m.while girls are still fetch-ing water,and school holidays are at oddswith local market dates.The “social distance”between providersand their clients can be large.In Niger,amainly rural country,a study found 43 per-cent ofthe parents ofnurses and midwiveswere civil servants,and 70 percent ofthemhad been raised in the city.All ofthem went towork by car—a rarity in that country.99Sadconsequences ofthe social distance betweenproviders and clients are not hard to ﬁnd.InEgypt participants in a discussion group com-plained about the attitude ofstaffat the localrural hospital,with one respondent summingup the experience:“They have their noses upin the air and neglect us.”100In South Africa afocus group member comments about a pri-mary health care provider:“Sometimes I feelas ifapartheid has never left this place....They really have a way ofmaking you feel likeyou are a piece ofrubbish.”101Services must be relevant—ﬁlling a per-ceived need—or there will be little demandfor them (box 1.3).Ifprimary schools teachskills relevant only for secondary school—andnot for life outside ofschool—only childrenfrom richer families who expect to continueto the secondary level will deem it worthwhileto complete primary school.In Ghana onerespondent claimed:“School is useless:chil-dren spend time in school and then they’reunemployed and haven’t learned to work onthe land.”102In India one component ofanintegrated childhood development programfailed when beneﬁciaries rejected the foodServices can work for poor people but too often they fail25“At the back of the classroom of 40 boys sat2 girls....What did the girls want to be whenthey grew up? ‘A teacher,’one said.’A doc-tor,’said the other.But less than a quarter ofthe women in Yemen are literate,and theymust follow the path of the traditional vil-lage women,who usually marry in theirteens and have an average of 10 children.Inthe countryside of Dhamar Province,one ofthe country’s poorest,there are few profes-sional activities for anyone,much less forwomen.Besides,most parents won’t let theirdaughters go to school—deeming it unac-ceptable for them either to learn alongsideboys or to walk to class in the street.“In Yemen girls make up about one inthree students at the primary level,one infour at the secondary level.More than 75percent of women over 15 are illiterate,compared with 35 percent of men.Girls’education is not the only problem,however.The net enrollment rate for boys is only 75percent at the primary level,70 percent atthe secondary level.Sources:Mayer (1997),World Bank (2002g).BOX 1.3School services for girls are not in high demand in Dhamar Province,Yemen03_WDR_Ch01.qxd  8/14/03  7:36 AM  Page 25(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

grain supplied.Eventually the programchanged what it offered to match varyingpreferences in different parts ofthe country.And again,this need not be.In the Niokiarea ofZaire (now the Democratic RepublicofCongo),where the use ofhealth servicesdeclined substantially between 1987 and1991,it increased in clinics with nurses whohad good interpersonal skills.103Amongindigenous peoples in Bolivia,Ecuador,Guatemala,Mexico,Paraguay,and Peru,pro-moting bilingual and intercultural educationcontributed to improved schooling out-comes.104An innovative public health cam-paign among sex workers in Sonagachi,India,trained “peer educators”to pass infor-mation to their co-workers.Disseminatinginformation in this way resulted in more con-dom use and substantially less HIV infectionthan in other cities.The approach had knock-on effects as well:sex workers organized aunion and effectively lobbied for legalization,reduction in police harassment,and otherrights.105Little evaluation,little innovation,stagnant productivityIn most settings there are few evaluations ofnew interventions,and so no effective inno-vation and improvement in the productivityofservices.Evaluating innovative servicearrangements—such as new forms ofaccountability—is rarer still.Ifsystems don’tbuild in ways oflearning about how to dothings better,it should be no surprise whenthey stagnate.Relying on research from othercountries,while useful,is not enough.Find-ing out how a particular intervention worksin each country setting is crucial,since his-tory,politics,and institutions determine whatworks,what doesn’t,and why.Once again,this need not be.Althoughrarely carried out,some programs have triedto incorporate evaluation components tolearn about the program.Mexico’s Progresaexplicitly included randomization and evalu-ation in its design.The results ofthe evalua-tion—well documented and disseminated inthe media—helped solidify support for theprogram.They showed what was most effec-tive,contributing to the program’s extensionto a large part ofthe country’s poor people(see spotlight).But even without an experi-mental design,it is possible to learn aboutsystems and to innovate.For example,theProbe study in India documented a variety ofshortcomings ofthe quality ofprimaryschools.The widely publicized results con-tributed to mobilizing support for reform.106Making services work to improve outcomesMany ofthe examples discussed so fardescribe failures in the public sector’s provi-sion ofservices,but they are not the onlystory.The 20th century has seen enormousimprovements in living standards.Lifeexpectancy has improved dramatically innearly every country.The expansion ofschooling has been similarly remarkable.Innearly every country illiteracy has beenreduced dramatically,enrollment rates havegone up,and the average schooling ofthepopulation has more than doubled.Civil ser-vice bureaucracies providing good serviceshave been integral elements ofthose suc-cesses.In many settings staffmust overcomemajor obstacles—including threats to theirown safety—in order to teach children orprovide care to the sick.What do services that work look like? Safeand pleasant schools with children learningto read and write.Primary clinics with healthworkers dispensing proper advice and medi-cine.Water networks distributing safe anddependable water.Direct subsidies to poorchildren and their families encouragingdemand.Services that are accessible,afford-able,and ofgood quality—helping toimprove outcomes for poor people.Governments take on a responsibility tomake services work in order to promotehealth and education outcomes.Chapter 2addresses the reasons for this responsibility,dwelling on three seemingly straightforwardways to discharge it:relying solely on eco-nomic growth,allocating public spending,orapplying technical ﬁxes.None ofthem isenough by itself.Making services workrequires improving the institutional arrange-ments for producing them.Chapters 3 to 6 ofthis Report develop a framework for analyz-ing those arrangements.Chapters 7 to 11apply the framework and draw lessons forgovernments and donors.26WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 200403_WDR_Ch01.qxd  8/14/03  7:36 AM  Page 26(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Services can work for poor people but too often they fail27Health and education outcomes aredetermined by more than the availability andquality of health care and schooling.Betternutrition helps children learn.Better refrigera-tion and transport networks help keep medi-cines safe.Many factors determine outcomeson both the demand and the supply sides,linked at many levels.The demand for healthand education is determined by individualsand households weighing the beneﬁts andcosts of their choices and the constraints theyface.The supply of services that affect healthand education outcomes starts with globaltechnological knowledge and goes all the wayto whether teachers report for work and com-munities maintain water pumps.Demand:individuals and householdsBeneﬁts and costs determine how much anindividual invests in education or health.What are the beneﬁts? Higher levels of edu-cation and health are associated with higherproductivity—and higher earnings.Investingin human capital is a way to get thosereturns.But the returns might vary for differ-ent people,such as lower expected earningsfor women or for ethnic minorities.In thesecases one would expect different levels ofinvestment:different desired levels of school-ing,for instance.A crucial element ofdemand is the degree to which individualsrather than society reap the rewards.Goodswith large positive externalities—in theextreme,public goods—will be demanded atless than the socially optimal level.What are the costs? There are directcosts:user fees,transport costs,textbookfees,drug costs.Some of these can be borneby families—though not all families.Copingmechanisms for those that cannot are oftenhard to use.For example,the lack of insur-ance markets can make it hard to absorbthe ﬁnancial burden of sudden illness.Orthe inability to borrow against future earn-ings can make it hard to borrow for school-ing investments.Indirect costs can also be large.For exam-ple,children often contribute to householdincome by working inside or outside thehome (looking after siblings,working on thefamily farm).The value of this contribution isforgone if they spend substantial time inschool.The total cost of illness includes days ofwork lost recovering,seeking care,or lookingafter the ill.Richer families can cope betterwith these costs,which leads to a direct asso-ciation between income and outcomes.Inaddition,better health and education areoften valued in themselves.As incomesincrease families demand more of them,which again results in an associationbetween income and outcomes.The production of health and educationdepends on the knowledge and practices ofadults in households.This works throughboth the demand for human capital and thegeneration of outcomes.A review of fourhygiene interventions that targeted handwashing in poor countries found 35 percentless diarrhea-related illness among childrenwho received the interventions.And factorsCRATE 1.1Determinants ofhealth and education outcomes—within,outside,and across sectors The determinants of supply and demand operate through many channelsSupplyOutcomesOutcomes• Child mortality• Child nutrition• School completion/   learning, achievement• Income• Wealth• Education and knowledgePolicies, capacity,technical know-how,politics• Global knowledge•National macro-, sector-, and micro-level policies• Technical capacity  to implement policies•Governance; politics and patronage; political capacity; and incentives to implement policiesHealth, nutrition,education sectors• Service price, accessibility, and quality• Financing arrangementsRelated sectors•Availability, prices, and accessibility of food, energy, roads . . .• Other infrastructure• EnvironmentLocal context• Local government and politics• Community institutions• Cultural norms (e.g., women’s status)• Social capitalHouseholds and individualsBehaviors and actions•Health: preventive care, care-seeking for illness, feeding practices, sanitary practices, . . .•Education: enrollment and school participation, learning outside of school, . . .ConstraintsDemand(continued)03_WDR_Ch01.qxd  8/21/03  8:57 AM  Page 27(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

28WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004in the home complement schooling:booksand reading at home contribute to literacy.Investments in the human capital of chil-dren are sensitive to the allocation of powerwithin households:families in which the bar-gaining power of women is stronger tend toinvest more in health and education.A studyin Brazil found that demand for calories andprotein was up to 10 times more responsiveto women’s than men’s income.This result,strongest in societies that proscribe women’sroles,tends to affect girls more than boys.More generally,the roles and responsibili-ties of different household members canaffect how investments are made.A womanin Egypt says:“We face a calamity when myhusband falls ill.Our life comes to a halt untilhe recovers.”Her husband’s earnings are cru-cial for sustaining the family.Since productiv-ity is related to illness,households respond.In Bangladesh a study found that householdmembers who engaged in more strenuousactivities received more nutritious food.Daughters’education might be less valuableto parents if sons typically look after them intheir old age,so parents might be less willingto send girls to school.Demand:links between sectors atindividual and household levelsHealth and nutritional status directly affectsa child’s probability of school enrollment andcapacity to learn and succeed in school.Mal-nutrition among children was associatedwith signiﬁcant delays in school enrollmentin Ghana.Improving child health and nutri-tion at the pre-primary level has long-termimpacts on development.A study in thePhilippines found that a one-standard-devia-tion increase in early-age child healthincreased subsequent test scores by about athird of a standard deviation.Improving the health and nutritional sta-tus of students positively affects schoolenrollment and attendance.A longitudinalstudy in Pakistan found that a one-third of astandard deviation increase in child heightincreased school enrollment by 19 percent-age points for girls and 4 percentage pointsfor boys.An evaluation of school-based masstreatment for deworming in rural Kenyafound that student absenteeism fell by aquarter—but test scores did not appear tobe affected.Improving nutrition is not as sim-ple as supplementary feeding at school:households can reallocate resources with theeffect of “sharing”that food.A study in thePhilippines found no such sharing in general,but for a school snack program there wassharing in poorer families.Parents’education has intergenerationaleffects on the health,nutritional status,andschooling of their children.Adult female edu-cation is one of the most robust correlates ofchild mortality in cross-national studies,evencontrolling for national income.Similarly,mother’s education is a strong determinantof lower mortality at the household level,though the relationship weakens when otherhousehold and community socioeconomiccharacteristics are controlled for.A large partof this effect might not be general educationbut speciﬁc health knowledge,perhapsacquired using literacy and numeracy skillslearned in school,as a study in Moroccofound.The effects can also be interspatial:astudy in Peru found that the education of amother’s neighbors signiﬁcantly increasesthe nutritional status of her children.Parents’education is similarly associated with theschooling of their children,though the mag-nitude of the effect—and the relative roles ofmother’s and father’s education—vary sub-stantially across countries.Access to—and use of—safe water,aswell as adequate sanitation,have directeffects on health status.Hand washing is apowerful health practice,but it requires sufﬁ-cient quantities of water.An eight-countrystudy found that going from no improvedwater to “optimal”water was associated witha 6-percentage-point reduction in the preva-lence of diarrhea in children under threeyears of age (from a base of 25 percent) inhouseholds without sanitation.Nutritionalstatus was likewise associated with access toimproved water.But not all studies ﬁndstrong associations between water sourceand better health.The water source is only part of the story:in Bangladesh water accessed through tube-wells—an “improved”source— is frequentlycontaminated with arsenic.One study foundthat arsenic levels higher than the WorldHealth Organization’s maximum acceptablelevel are associated with twice the level ofdiarrhea in children under age six.Extremelyhigh levels of arsenic are associated withshorter stature among adolescents.The same eight-country study mentionedabove found that going to “optimal”sanitation from none was associated with a10-percentage-point drop in recent diarrheain households with no improved watersource.As in education,there are spillovereffects:sanitation practices at the communitylevel impact everyone’s health.In Peru thesanitation investments of a family’s neighborswere associated with better nutritional statusfor that family’s children.The use of safe energy sourcesaffectsboth health and education.Indoor air pollu-tion—from using dirty cooking and heatingfuels—hurts child health.One review ofstudies found that the probability of respi-ratory illness,or even death,was betweentwo and ﬁve times higher in houses whereexposure to indoor air pollution was high.Astudy in Guatemala found birth weights 65grams lower among newborns of womenwho used wood as a domestic cooking fuel.Coping with the cold,in cold climates,affects health and imposes substantialdirect and indirect costs on households.Education is affected as well:schools haveto close when there is not enough heat,andit is hard to imagine that working onschoolwork at home is an option whenindoor temperatures are below freezing.Supply:global developmentsAt any given income,health and educationoutcomes have been improving.A continu-ing trend in improvements in health goingback several decades is interpreted asadvances in technologies and leaps inknowledge about health and hygiene.Morerecently,at a national income of $600 percapita,predicted child mortality fell from100 per 1,000 births to 80—a full 20percent reduction—between 1990 and2000.If this association were sustained,major headway would be made toward theMillennium Development Goal throughthese changes alone.Major breakthroughsin immunizations for malaria—or HIV—could have a huge impact on mortality atall income levels.Recent years have seen major develop-ments in global funding for health and edu-cation expenditures.Debt relief through theHeavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative istied to increases in expenditures on thesesectors.New assistance,delivered throughmultisectoral products such as PovertyReduction Support Credits,requires explicitstrategies for human developmentinvestments.Global funds for health and the“Fast-Track Initiative”for education are inter-national pledges to support initiatives in thesectors (chapter 11).Easing ﬁnancialconstraints goes hand in hand with usingresources effectively to support services thatwork for poor people.CRATE 1.1Determinants ofhealth and education outcomes—within,outside,and across sectors

Services can work for poor people but too often they fail29Supply:national resourcesNational income is strongly associated withchild mortality and primary school comple-tion.Income and health and education out-comes build on each other.More incomeleads to better human developmentoutcomes,and better health and educationcan lead to increased productivity and betterincomes.Studies that have tried to disentan-gle these relationships typically ﬁnd incometo be a robust and strong determinant ofoutcomes.National endowments are also a strongdeterminant.Geography and climate some-times make it tougher to overcome healthproblems.For example,areas conducive tomosquito survival have great difﬁculty in com-bating malaria—and widely dispersed popu-lations are difﬁcult to serve throughtraditional school systems.The performance of public expenditure inproducing outcomes varies substantially acrosscountries.There are large differences inachievements at similar levels of expenditureand similar achievements with very large differ-ences in expenditures—conditional on income.Spending more through the public sector is notalways associated with improved outcomes.This is not to say that spending cannot be help-ful—but the way resources are used is crucialto their effectiveness.Supply:political,economic,and policy contextGovernance affects the efﬁciency of expendi-tures:in corrupt settings money that is osten-sibly earmarked for improving human devel-opment outcomes is diverted.Staffsostensibly delivering services do not.But theeffects of poor governance can be deeper.Famines are caused as much by human fac-tors as by nature.And the repercussions runacross national borders.For example,adrought combined with misguided policiesand bad governance in Zimbabwe resultedin a regional food shortage.Managing public expenditures can be acritical link in ensuring that allocated expen-ditures get put to uses that improveoutcomes.“Cash budgeting”in Zambia led tounpredictable social service spending anddeep cuts in spending on rural infrastructure.Conﬂict leaves long-lived scars on healthand education.Children in war-torn countriesare hard to ﬁnd,hard to get into school,andhard to keep in school.During Sierra Leone’srecent civil war,tens of thousands of childrenattended primary school but hundreds ofthousands did not.Wars,including civil wars,lead to “lost generations”of undernourishedand undereducated children.These deﬁcien-cies are difﬁcult—if not impossible—to makeup for.When children have been out ofschool for a long time,it is hard to return.And bad health and poor nutrition at an earlyage affect children throughout their lives.Periods of national economic and socialcrisis can result in bad health and educationoutcomes.This is clear in Russia’s recent his-tory:adult mortality has increased dramati-cally over the past 10 years.Sustainedeconomic depression can severely compro-mise children’s health and have cascadingeffects on subsequent development andlearning.The evidence of shorter-term eco-nomic crises is more mixed.In middle-income environments school enrollmentsmight increase as the opportunity cost oftime for young people falls.Even in Indone-sia,a relatively poor country,the deepeconomic and social crisis of the late 1990shad smaller impacts on outcomes than ini-tially feared.This was partly because broadsocial safety nets were rapidly put in place.Supply:the local context of governmentand communitiesDecentralization can be a powerful tool formoving decisionmaking closer to thoseaffected by it.Doing so can strengthen thelinks and accountability between policymak-ers and citizens—local governments arepotentially more accountable to localdemands.It can also strengthen thembetween policymakers and providers—localgovernments are potentially more able tomonitor providers.But local governmentsshould not be romanticized.Like nationalgovernments they are vulnerable tocapture—and this might be easier for localelites on a local scale.Community-level institutions,shaped bycultural norms and practices,can facilitateor hinder an environment for improvingoutcomes.A review of safe-water projects inCentral Java,Indonesia,associates successwith greater social capital.In Rajasthan,India,manifestations of “mutually beneﬁcialcollective action”were associated withwatershed conservation and developmentactivities more generally.A broader reviewof the literature suggests that participatoryapproaches to implementing projects aremore successful in communities with lesseconomic inequality and less social and eth-nic heterogeneity.Supply:services and their ﬁnancingServices themselves are important.Inacces-sible or poor-quality services raise theeffective price of health care and schooling,which results in higher mortality and lowereducational achievement.Poor-qualityschools deter enrollment and reduceattainment and achievement,especiallyamong children of poor families.Healthclinics where the technical skills of staff areso bad as to be dangerous will lead tohigher mortality.Lack of water will signiﬁ-cantly hurt child health.Financing arrangements matter.Absorb-ing the burden of unpredictable large expen-ditures through health insurance can reduceimpoverishment,which in turn will affectoutcomes.Financing primary schoolingmight seem relatively minor:direct costs aretypically small.Even so,a lack of access tocredit has been found to be associated withlower school enrollment.Borrowing to paythe direct costs of primary school is almostunheard of,but there could be second-roundeffects if the lack of access to credit meansthat families need children to engage inhome production.Supply:services working together toproduce outcomesLinks among services are critical.Vaccinescan become less effective,ineffective,oreven dangerous if they get too hot,freeze,or are exposed to light.The ability to trans-port and store vaccines properly thusdetermines the success of immunizationcampaigns.In cold climates schools andhealth facilities often need to close becauseof the lack of heating,and dependableenergy sources can directly affect healthand education outcomes.The accessibilityof services can be a deterrent to their use:roads and adequate transport contribute tothe total cost of using a service.Since theexpected return to education determinesthe beneﬁts of schooling,labor marketsthat are not fundamentally distorted (forexample,through discriminatory practicestoward marginalized groups) cancontribute to higher educationachievement.Services therefore need towork together to promote improvedoutcomes.Source:Sources are detailed in Filmer (2003a).CRATE 1.1Determinants ofhealth and education

When President Vincente Fox was elect-ed,his government embraced the program,built on it using the evaluation results,expanded it to urban areas,and renamed itOportunidades.By the end of2002 the pro-gram had about 21 million beneﬁciaries—roughly a ﬁfth ofthe Mexican population.Designing a comprehensiveprogramChildren over seven were eligible for educa-tion transfers.Beneﬁts increased by grade(since opportunity costs increase with age)and were higher for girls in middle school,to encourage their enrollment.To retain thebeneﬁts,children needed to maintain an 85percent attendance record and could notrepeat a grade more than once.Eligible families could also receive amonthly stipend ifmembers got regular med-ical checkups and mothers attended monthlynutrition and hygiene information sessions.Households with children under three couldalso receive a micronutrient supplement.The transfers went to mothers,whowere thought more responsible for caringfor children.The program imposed amonthly ceiling of$75 per family.In 1999the average monthly transfer was around$24 per family,nearly 20 percent ofmeanhousehold consumption before the pro-gram.Transfers were also inﬂation-indexedevery six months (today the maximum is$95 and the average is $35).Highly centralized,the program has justone intermediary between program ofﬁ-cials and beneﬁciaries—a woman commu-nity promoter chosen by a general assemblyofhouseholds in targeted communities.Shecan also liaise between beneﬁciaries andeducation and health providers.By the end of1999 the program coveredsome 2.6 million rural families—about 40percent ofrural families and a ninth ofallfamilies in Mexico.The program budgetwas almost $780 million,or 0.2 percent ofgross domestic product and 20 percent ofthe federal poverty alleviation budget.When Ernesto Zedillo becameMexico’s president in 1995,aﬁfth ofthe population couldnot afford the minimum daily nutritionalrequirements,10 million Mexicans lackedaccess to basic health services,more than1.5 million children were out ofschool,and student absenteeism and school deser-tions were three times higher in poor andremote areas than in the rest ofthe coun-try.The country had a history ofunpro-ductive poverty alleviation programs.Worse,the 1994–95 economic crisis left thegovernment with even fewer resources—and greater demands,as more people werefalling into poverty.The administration decided that a newapproach to poverty alleviation was need-ed.The Education,Health,and NutritionProgram ofMexico,called Progresa,intro-duced a set ofconditional cash transfers topoor families—iftheir children wereenrolled in school and iffamily membersvisited health clinics for checkups andnutrition and hygiene information.The program was intended to remedyseveral shortcomings ofearlier programs.First,it would counter the bias in poor fam-ilies toward present consumption by bol-stering investment in human capital.Second,it would recognize the interdepen-dencies among education,health,andnutrition.Third,to stretch limitedresources,it would link cash transfers tohousehold behavior,aiming at changingattitudes.Fourth,to reduce political inter-ference,the program’s goals,rules,require-ments,and evaluation methods would bewidely publicized.The program has been rigorously evalu-ated,and evaluators have exploited the ran-domized way the program was rolled out.The results have been impressive.Toemphasize the apolitical nature ofthe pro-gram,the government suspended thegrowth ofthe program for six months priorto the election in 2000—to show thatProgresa was not a political tool.Almost 60 percent ofprogram transferswent to households in the poorest 20 per-cent ofthe national income distribution andmore than 80 percent to the poorest 40 per-cent.This is impressive.The median target-ing effectiveness in 77 safety net programsfrom around the world was to have 65 per-cent ofbeneﬁts go to the poorest 40 percent(according to one recent study).Even with careful targeting and moni-toring,the program’s administrative costswere less than 9 percent oftotal costs—sub-stantially lower than earlier poverty allevia-tion efforts in Mexico.Despite its initiallarge scale,the program did not cover allthe poor,particularly in urban areas.Boosting enrollmentsGirls’enrollment in middle school rose from67 percent to around 75 percent,and boys’from 73 percent to 78 percent.Most oftheincrease came from increases in the transi-tion from primary to middle school (ﬁgure1).The program worked primarily by keep-ing children in school,not by encouragingthose who had dropped out to return.It alsohelped reduce the incidence ofchild labor.Conditional cash transfers to reduce poverty in MexicoProgresa,the Education,Health,and Nutrition Program ofMexico,transferred money directly to families on the condi-tion that family members went for health checkups,mothers went for hygiene and nutrition information sessions,andchildren attended school.By documenting success through rigorous evaluation,the program has improved,scaled up,and taught others.107Progresaspotlight on

Spotlight on Progressa31cation impacts would increase them by 8percent.A general equilibrium analysis ofProgresa found that the welfare impact was60 percent higher than that ofthe highlydistortionary food subsidies that Mexicoused previously.Evaluating impactsProgresa was unusual in integrating evalua-tion from the beginning,enabling it toassess impacts fairly precisely.To ensurepolitical credibility,the evaluation was con-tracted out to a foreign-based researchgroup,the International Food PolicyResearch Institute.Phasing in communities in a randomfashion—required for budgetary purpos-es—allowed the construction of186 con-trol and 320 treatment groups.Having thecontrol groups enabled evaluators to “washout”confounding factors,including timetrends and shocks (economic and climatic).Eventually all control communities wereincorporated in the program.Both quanti-tative and qualitative evaluations were con-ducted,the latter using semistructuredinterviews,focus groups,and workshops.Labor force participation decreased by about20 percent for boys.Still,a substantial num-ber ofchildren from poor families continueto combine work with school.The impacts on learning are less clear.Teachers report improvements,attributingthem to better attendance,student interest,and nutrition.But a study conducted oneyear after the program started found no dif-ference in test scores.Improving nutrition and healthThe program helped reduce the incidenceoflow height for age among children one tothree years old.(Before the program stunt-ing was very high,at 44 percent.) Annualmean growth in height was 16 percent forchildren covered by the program.On aver-age,height increased by 1–4 percent,andweight by 3.5 percent.These gains wereachieved despite evidence that some house-holds did not regularly receive nutritionsupplements and that supplements wereoften “shared”with older children.Part ofthe effect can be attributed to spendingmore on food and to consuming morenutritious food,as recommended by thenutrition information sessions.There werealso positive spillover effects for nonbeneﬁ-ciaries in the same community.The program substantially increasedpreventive health care visits.Visits by preg-nant women in their ﬁrst trimester rose 8percent,keeping babies and mothershealthier.Illnesses dropped 25 percentamong newborns and 20 percent amongchildren under ﬁve (ﬁgure 2).The preva-lence ofanemia in children two to fouryears old declined 19 percent.Adult healthimproved too.Reducing povertyThe program is not only raising incomestemporarily,it should help raise future pro-ductivity and earnings ofthe children ben-eﬁting.Modeling exercises ﬁnd that nutri-tional supplements alone would boost life-time earnings by about 3 percent and edu-The evaluation design captures themany determinants ofoutcomes.But it haslimitations.Policymakers would beneﬁtfrom knowing how the program could bemanipulated to improve impacts.Forexample,what is the impact ofcondition-ing the transfers rather than giving pureunconditioned transfers? In addition,households in the control group might havebeen affected by the intervention or byknowing that they might receive it in thefuture,an effect that would muddy thecomparisons.Evaluations can address these issues,butthe complexity (and expense) increasessubstantially.Alternative approaches thatrely on modeling—imposing additionalassumptions on the analysis—might benecessary.Such analyses are currentlyunderway.Evidence makes the differenceA conditional cash transfer program can bea powerful way ofpromoting education,health,and nutritional outcomes on amassive scale.The success ofthe Progresaprogram has led to similar programs,especially in other Latin American coun-tries (Colombia,Honduras,Jamaica,andNicaragua).Evaluation was not an afterthought.Itcontinually fed back into improving pro-gram operations.And its rigor increasedconﬁdence in the validity ofassessments ofthe program’s effects.Evaluation was important for domesticand international political and economicsupport—and thus contributed to pro-gram sustainability.Unlike previous pro-grams,this one was not abandoned after achange in government.Clear and credibleevidence oflarge beneﬁts for the country’spoor contributed to maintaining theintegrity ofthe program’s design (albeitwith a name change).It also made it easierto get support from the Inter-AmericanDevelopment Bank for a major expansionofthe program.005Time since intervention (months)1015203020104050PercentAge 0–2: ProgresaAge 3–5: ProgresaAge 0–2: Non-ProgresaAge 3–5: Non-ProgresaFigure 2Improving child healthPercentage of children reported to have had anillness.Note:Age at start of intervention.Source: Gertler (2000).04_pgs 30-31_Ch01Spotlight.qxd  8/14/03  1:46 PM  Page 31(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

32The responsibility that governments take onfor basic health and education can be dis-charged in many ways—among them,foster-ing economic growth,increasing publicspending,and applying technical interven-tions.Each can contribute to better outcomes.But ifthey are not supporting services thatwork—services that result from effective insti-tutional arrangements—they will not make alarge sustainable difference.Making serviceswork requires changing the institutional rela-tionships among key actors.Subsequent chap-ters ofthis Report develop and apply a frame-work to understand how and why thoserelationships play out for different services.Economic growth,though a majordeterminant ofhuman development out-comes,would need to be substantially fasterthan it has been in most countries to makedramatic improvements through that chan-nel alone.Public spending makes improve-ments possible,but the improvements willfall short ifspending fails to reach poorpeople—either because it goes for thingsthe poor do not use or because it is divertedalong the way—or ifservices are not mademore productive.Applying technical inter-ventions—combining inputs to produceoutputs and outcomes more effectively—isalso important.But simply adjusting inputswithout reforming the institutions that pro-duce inefﬁciencies will not lead to sustain-able improvements.A public responsibilityGovernments—and the societies theyrepresent—often see improving outcomes inhealth and education as a public responsibil-ity.They are supported in this by the interna-tional endorsement ofthe MillenniumDevelopment Goals (see Overview).A varietyofreasons lie behind this responsibility:clas-sic welfare economics arguments for govern-ment intervention,political economy reasonsfor intervention in key social sectors,appealsto fundamental human rights.Governmentsdemonstrate their responsibility by ﬁnanc-ing,providing,or regulating the services thatcontribute to health and education out-comes.The services come in many shapesand sizes:building and stafﬁng schools,sub-sidizing hospitals,regulating water and elec-trical utility companies,building roads,pro-viding cash transfers to individuals andhouseholds.Making these services workmeans that governments are meeting theirresponsibility.Public spendingThis responsibility is often reﬂected in gov-ernment spending.Health and educationalone account for about a third ofaggregategovernment spending,with the averageslightly lower in poorer countries and regions(table 2.1).But there are wide variationsacross countries,even within the sameregion.Health and education spendingaccounted for 13 percent ofpublic spendingin Sierra Leone in 1998 but 34 percent inKenya—18 percent in Estonia in 1997 but 59percent in Moldova in 1996.Social securityand welfare spending,much ofit directed toimproving health and education,typicallymakes up another 10–20 percent ofaggregatespending.108Governments contribute a large share ofthe ﬁnancing for schools and clinics.Wagesand salaries on average account for 75 per-cent ofrecurrent public spending on educa-tion—and often for almost all the spending(96 percent in Kenya).109Most teachers andmany health workers are civil service employ-ees.Salaries aside,government subsidies canmake up a large share ofa facility’s budget.Governments should make services work2chapter05_WDR_Ch02.qxd  8/14/03  7:47 AM  Page 32(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Governments should make services work33Public provisionIn education,health,water,and electricity thepublic sector is a major provider (ifnot amonopoly) as well as a funder ofservices.TheIndonesian government operates more than150,000 primary schools and 10,000 juniorsecondary schools that cover 85 percent and60 percent ofthe respective enrollments.110The Ugandan government operated 1,400primary level facilities and close to 100 hospi-tals in 1996.111The Indian public sector runsalmost 200,000 primary health facilities and15,000 secondary and tertiary facilities.112Butwide public provision does not always trans-late into substantial use.In Uganda govern-ment health facilities handled just 40 percentoftreatments sought in facilities.113In India,even with the huge organization ofpublichealth facilities,the private sector accounts for80 percent ofoutpatient treatments andalmost 60 percent ofinpatient treatments.114Reasons for public responsibilityEconomics gives two rationales for publicresponsibility.First,because ofmarket fail-ures,the amount ofservices produced andconsumed would be less than optimal fromsociety’s standpoint without governmentintervention.Market failures can be external-ities.The fact that an immunized childreduces the spread ofdisease in society is anincentive to immunize more children.Basiceducation might beneﬁt others besides thegraduate,another externality.Individualshave little incentive to build and maintain theroads that are crucial to promoting access toservices,but communities and societies do.“Public goods”(goods that,once produced,cannot be denied to anyone else and whoseconsumption by one person does not dimin-ish consumption by others) are an extremeform ofmarket failure.Mosquito control in amalaria-endemic area is an example.There isno market incentive to produce public goods,so government intervention is required.Other market failures relate to imperfectinformation.Different information aboutindividuals’risk ofillness can lead to a break-down in the market for health insurance.Lack ofknowledge about the beneﬁts ofhandwashing or ofeducation can lead to less thandesirable investment and consumption.115These market failures call for governmentintervention,but they do not necessarily callfor public provision:it could well be that theproper role is ﬁnancing,regulation,or infor-mation dissemination.The second economics justiﬁcation forpublic responsibility is equity.Improvinghealth and education outcomes for poor peo-ple,or reducing the gaps in outcomes betweenpoor people and those who are better off,isoften considered a responsibility ofgovern-ment.There are a variety ofsocial justice rea-sons behind this.Some see this responsibilityas rooted in the beliefthat basic educationand basic health are fundamental humanrights (box 2.1).The United Nations Univer-sal Declaration ofHuman Rights asserts anindividual’s right to “a standard ofliving ade-quate for the health and well-being ofhimselfand ofhis family,including food,clothing,housing and medical care”and a right to edu-cation that is compulsory and “free,at least inthe elementary and fundamental stages.”116Subsequent international accords haveexpanded the set ofhealth and educationrights.117Many national constitutions haveguarantees for health and education.Table 2.1Public expenditures on health and education: large but varied Education and health spending as a share of government expenditures and as a share of GDP, in 2000 or latest year available (percent) Share of public expendituresShare of GDPAverageMinimumMaximumAverageMinimumMaximumEast Asia and Paciﬁc2712536211Europe and  Central Asia31185910417Latin America  and Caribbean3314528413Middle East and North Africa2313397412South Asia211625548Sub-Saharan Africa2513347212Low-income countries2512596217Middle-income countries2913538414High-income countries33205611315Note: Of the 135 countries included, 52 have data for 2000, 8 for 2001, 30 for 1999, 17 for 1998.

34WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004The notion ofhealth and education asbasic human rights provides a strong basis forpublic responsibility,but ambiguities remain.Does a right to medical care imply that gov-ernment must provide it or even ﬁnance it?The human rights to “periodic holidays withpay”or “equal work for equal pay,”as men-tioned in the United Nations declaration,aregenerally not interpreted to imply govern-ment subsidies.118Although free elementaryeducation is asserted as a right,parents alsohave a right “to choose the kind ofeducationthat shall be given to their children”—sug-gesting that universal public provision is notrequired.119Social equity and fundamentalhuman rights suggest a responsibility for gov-ernment but leave open the ways ofdischarg-ing that responsibility.Importantly,enshrin-ing these notions as rights legitimizes thedemands ofcitizens—especially poor citi-zens—that government take responsibilityfor making services work.Market failures and social justice are nor-mative justiﬁcations for public responsibility—they describe why governments should beinvolved.They do not always give much guid-ance on how.Why governments actually getinvolved provides insight on how publicresponsibility is discharged.Education has longbeen a battleground for beliefs,ideas,and val-ues.The late 19th and early 20th centuries offermany stories ofthis battle,from the movementfor secular primary education in France to apublic education system focused on national-ism after the Meiji restoration in Japan.120Much ofthis involvement is high-minded:a coherent public education system probablycontributes to social cohesion,particularlyimportant in fractionalized societies.121Post-colonial states embraced public provision ofeducation as a strategy for nation building.But public provision can also be the rationalmanifestation ofa state’s desire to inculcate aparticular set ofbeliefs.Tanzania’s 1967 edu-cation reforms were wrapped up with Ujamaand African Socialism.Indonesia’s mass edu-cation campaign was closely tied to nation-building and national ideology codiﬁed inpancasila—principles whose teaching wasenforced in every school until the fall oftheNew Order government.Beyond nation building and social cohe-sion,services operate fully in the politicalrealm:free education and free health care areelectoral rallying cries in many countries,popular with many voters.In 1997 Uganda’sPresident Museveni campaigned on a plat-form offree universal primary education.The message was extremely popular—hewon—and within a short time ofﬁcial enroll-ments nearly doubled (see spotlight).122Uganda is not unique:many politicians iden-tify themselves with their stance toward pub-lic provision ofservices.But success is hard:few politicians have been able to transformthese political platforms into outcomes.Ser-Debates on health care and education in devel-oping countries often appeal to human rights.Rooted in the broader context of social justice,these rights are set forth in the Universal Decla-ration of Human Rights (1948) as well as otherinternational conventions,such as the Interna-tional Covenant on Economic and Social Rights(1966).Several international and bilateral agen-cies have endorsed a human rights orientation.In addition,the constitutions and laws of manycountries include references to rights to educa-tion and health care (a review of constitutionalrights in 165 countries with writtenconstitutions found that 116 referenced a rightto education and 73 a right to health care;95stipulated free education and 29 free healthcare for at least some services to some groups).With education and health central to rights,thepractical implications of approaches based onrights complement welfare economics.An approach based on rights emphasizesequality in dignity and equality of opportunity.It highlights the need to look at outcomes for allindividuals and groups,especially the legallyand socially disadvantaged.It makes explicit aconsideration that economics incorporates withdifﬁculty:many psychological repercussions topoverty result in poor people’s inability to availthemselves of health care and educationservices,even when such services are available.Welfare economics provides tools for assess-ing priorities and possibilities for interveningwhen budgets are limited —and offers a metricfor doing so.Several aspects of economic analy-sis provide instruments for implementing rights,complementing a rights-based approach.More generally,the approaches overlap onmany of their practical policy consequences.Both are skeptical that electoral politics and themarket provide enough accountability for effec-tive and equitable provision of health and edu-cation services—so there is a need for govern-ment and community involvement.Aneconomics approach to making services work—such as the one in this Report—is informed bythe guidance on participation andempowerment that international human rightsinstruments provide.In addition,rights reinforcepoor people’s claims on resources overall andon those allocated for basic services in particu-lar—key elements of the effective “voice”ofpoor people discussed here.Source:Gauri (2003).BOX 2.1Most governments take responsibility for health and education—often appealing to human rights05_WDR_Ch02.qxd  8/14/03  7:48 AM

Governments should make services work35vices operate in the political realm in yetanother way.Many politicians use jobs in thelarge bureaucracies associated with servicesto reward supporters or to build power.Growth,though essential,is not enoughGiven the responsibility to promote educationand health outcomes,what can governmentsdo? One approach is hands-off:rely solely oneconomic growth since higher nationalincome is strongly associated with lower childmortality and higher primary school comple-tion (crate 1.1 and ﬁgure 2.1).Among low-income countries,10 percent more incomeper capita is associated,on average,with a 6.6percent lower child mortality rate and a 4.8percent higher primary school completionrate.Among middle-income countries 10 per-cent more income per capita is associated with7.7 percent less mortality but little improve-ment in primary completion.At low levels ofincome relatively small dif-ferences in per capita income can mean big dif-ferences in outcomes.Per capita income wasonly about $90 higher in Madagascar than inMalawi in the 1990s,but there were almost 50fewer child deaths per 1,000 births in Madagas-car in 2000.123The association between incomeand health and education outcomes worksboth ways:more income leads to lower mortal-ity and more children completing primaryschool;better health and education can lead tohigher productivity and incomes.Studies havetried to disentangle these relationships,andthey typically still ﬁnd income to be a robustand strong determinant ofoutcomes.124But income is not the whole story:at anygiven income there are wide variations inachievement.With average incomes ofjustunder $300 per capita in the 1990s,Vietnamhad a child mortality rate ofabout 40 per1,000 in 2000 and Cambodia of120.At percapita incomes around $4,000 in the 1990s,Malaysia had a child mortality rate ofabout12 per 1,000 in 2000 and Brazil ofjust lessthan 40.Similarly,Madagascar and Nigeriaboth had per capita incomes close to $300 inthe 1990s,but by the end ofthe decade theprimary completion rate was 26 percent inMadagascar and 67 percent in Nigeria.125How much reduction in child mortalityand improvement in primary school comple-tion can be expected from income growthalone? Cutting child mortality by two-thirdsbetween 1990 and 2015 (one ofthe Millen-nium Development Goals) means reducing itby 4.4 percent a year.Low-income countrieswould need sustained per capita incomegrowth of6.7 percent a year to reduce mor-tality by two-thirds by 2015.Senegal wouldhave to boost per capita income from about$650 to $3,500—close to the level in Panama.Brazil would need an increase from almost$5,000 to $20,000—close to the per capitaincome in New Zealand.126Similarly,achieving universal primaryschool completion through income alonewould require massive economic growth.InMauritania,where primary school comple-tion was 46 percent in 1990,per capita incomegrowth would need to average 6.5 percent ayear.So while income and outcomes arestrongly associated,especially in low-incomecountries,reaching the Millennium Develop-ment Goals will require dramatically high—perhaps unrealistically high—growth rates ifgrowth is the only channel for achieving thegoals.Policies that do more than increasegrowth are required.127More public spending alone isnot enoughIfgrowth is not enough,what else can gov-ernments do to improve outcomes? Oneapproach is to spend more.Increasing publicFigure 2.1National income and outcomes are strongly associated, especially in low-incomecountries468GDP per capita (log)Under-five mortality rate, 2000 (log)10123456468GDP per capita (log)NigeriaBrazilMalawiCambodiaMadagascarMalaysiaVietnamPrimary school completion rate, 1999 (log)10123456MadagascarNote:The GDP per capita is based on a 1990s average, 1995 U.S. dollars.

spending can be a critical part ofpromotingimprovements in health and education.Forexample,it may be necessary to spend moreon interventions to reduce mortality or oneducation reforms that underpin increasesin primary completion rates—and part ofthis spending might require internationalassistance (box 2.2).But the large variationin the effectiveness ofusing funds makes ithard to ﬁnd a consistent relationshipbetween changes in spending and out-comes—highlighting the importance ofspending money well.Just how variable is the associationbetween public spending and outcomes? Aglimpse at a handful ofcountries provides anindication.•Between the 1980s and 1990s total publicspending on education in Ethiopia andMalawi increased by $8 per child ofpri-mary school age.128In Ethiopia primaryschool completion stagnated,going from22 percent in 1990 to 24 percent in 1999,while in Malawi it rose from 30 percentto 50 percent (ﬁgure 2.2).•Per capita public spending on health fellbetween $1 and $5 in Côte d’Ivoire andHaiti from the 1980s to the 1990s:childmortality worsened substantially in Côted’Ivoire but improved in Haiti—thoughremaining high (ﬁgure 2.3).•Thailand increased public spending onprimary schooling more than Peru did,yet primary school completions fell inThailand and increased in Peru.•Public spending on health diverged inMexico and Jordan,yet reductions inchild mortality were similar.36WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004With more than 100 million children not in pri-mary school,the “Fast-Track Initiative”(FTI) waslaunched in June 2002 to accelerate progresstoward Education for All in low-incomecountries.Under the FTI national educationplans are assessed against an indicative frame-work of policy benchmarks,prospects for scal-ing up,and allowances for ﬂexibility and learn-ing by doing.To ensure that education goals areembedded in an overall national strategy andconsistent with countries’medium-term expen-diture framework,a criterion for FTI eligibility isa national commitment to a formal PovertyReduction Strategy.The FTI supports countries in addressing keypolicy,capacity,data,and ﬁnancing constraintsto universal primary completion by 2015,netintake into ﬁrst grade of 100 percent of girls andboys by 2010,and improved learning outcomes.An initial group of 23 countries was invited tojoin the initiative,and all accepted.The FTI was inspired by the Monterrey Con-sensus—that better results accrue when devel-opment support is targeted to countries thataccept clear accountability for results and adoptappropriate policy reforms.The FTI wasconceived as a process for countries with soundeducation policies,embedded in an agreed-onmacroeconomic framework,to receive addedsupport from donors.Clear impacts—and obstaclesLess than a year into the process the FTI has hadsome clear positive impacts.First,it has demon-strated that the new framework of mutualaccountability is accepted by developing coun-tries.With impressive speed countries haveensured that their sector plans meet the new testsfor credibility and sustainability.And the donorshave increased resources for FTI countries,seconded staff to an international secretariat forthe initiative (in the World Bank),and agreed onFTI operating principles and guidelines.More generally,the FTI has:•Raised the political proﬁle of Education forAll,and increased awareness of the need forfaster progress to reach education goals.•Sharpened developing countries’focus onprimary school completion and quality (notjust coverage) and on the importance of get-ting policies right.•Brought ﬁeld-based donors into a uniﬁed pol-icy dialogue with governments,improvingcoordination.•Mobilized more resources for primary educa-tion (a 60 percent increase in ofﬁcial develop-ment assistance commitments to the ﬁrst FTIcountries).But the experience with FTI has also high-lighted some obstacles.At the country levelthese include difﬁculties in ensuring thatresources reach the service delivery level;a needto consider a variety of service deliverymodes—including community-run schools,NGO-run schools,and faith-based schools—andthe complexities of public support to this rangeof providers;the need to make difﬁcult reformsto increase efﬁciency and ensure sustainability;and the need for better data systems to support“real-time”tracking of education results.Some problems for donorsDespite some progress donor procedures arenot yet harmonized,and much ﬁnancingremains fragmented.Some donor assistanceunder the FTI continues to be input-driven,sub-ject to a “donor discount,”with resourcesearmarked for contractors in donor countriesrather than providing ﬂexible support for coreexpenditures.Too much aid still ﬂows to historicallypreferred countries,rather than good perform-ers.Although the donors have mobilized addi-tional funding for FTI countries case by case,there remain some “donor orphans.”Withoutpooled funding to support these countries,theFTI will not be able to deliver on the donors’commitment that “no country with a credibleplan for Education for All will be thwarted forlack of external support.”The momentum of FTIcould easily be lost if a fundamental principle ofthe compact—assistance supporting effectivepolicies—is not honored.The FTI is a major part of internationalresponses—including the G8 process,the Mon-terrey Consensus,and the New Economic Part-nership for African Development—to providemomentum for universal primary completion by2015,perhaps the most achievable of the Mil-lennium Development Goals.Success willrequire that developing countries pay attentionto policy reform and human and ﬁnancialresources.It will also require that donors coordi-nate better and honor their side of the bargainby assisting performing countries.Source:FTI secretariat.BOX 2.2The Fast-Track Initiative—providing assistance for credible national education

Governments should make services work37For each country there is a story aboutwhy public spending contributed to improv-ing outcomes or why it did not.That is thecrux:the effectiveness ofpublic spendingvaries tremendously.129In-depth studies con-ﬁrm this variability—for example,an analysisofMalaysia over the late 1980s found littleassociation between public spending on doc-tors and infant or maternal mortality.130Amajor improvement in the incidence ofpub-lic education spending on poor people inSouth Africa has been slow to translate intobetter outcomes.131But an impact evaluationofthe expansion ofpublic school places inIndonesia in the 1970s found a signiﬁcantpositive impact on school enrollments.132Another way to look at the impact ofpub-lic spending is in a cross-section ofcountries.In general,countries that spend more publicresources on health have lower child mortal-ity,and countries that spend more on educa-tion have higher completion rates.But thisassociation is driven largely by the fact thatpublic spending increases with nationalincome.After controlling for nationalincome,public spending and outcomes areonly weakly associated (ﬁgure 2.4)—bothsubstantively (in the sense that the correla-tion is small) and statistically (in the sensethat the correlation is indistinguishable fromzero).133With similar changes in spendingassociated with different changes in out-comes,it should come as no surprise that thecross-country association is so weak.Why does public spending have different impacts?Deeper analysis ofthe relation betweenpublic spending and child mortality ﬁndsresults varying from statistical signiﬁcanceto insigniﬁcance—for four main reasons.First,some countries might spend morebecause they need to spend more to remedyurgent underlying health problems.Theresulting cross-sectional association wouldbe uninformative since more spendingwould appear to be associated with worseoutcomes.Using statistical techniques thatexploit the variation in spending thatdepends on factors unrelated to mortalityFigure 2.2Changes in public spending andoutcomes are only weakly related: schooling0105201525MalawiMalawiEthiopia01980s1990s40020080060010000204060501990199970609080100EthiopiaThailandThailandPeruPeruPublic spending on educationDollarsPrimary school completionPercentNote:“Spending” refers to total annual public spending on educa-tion per child of primary school age, in 1995 U.S. dollars averagedfor the 1980s and the 1990s.

outcomes still produces an insigniﬁcant rela-tionship.134Those techniques are not univer-sally accepted,however,and it is possible thatgovernments are adjusting what they spend inresponse to underlying health conditions.Second,spending may affect differentgroups in society differently.Public spendingcould affect child mortality among poor fam-ilies without having a large overall impact.Studies allowing for this effect have found astronger association between spending andoutcomes for poor people—but the result isonly weakly signiﬁcant and not robust.135 A third strand ofthe research on this issuefocuses on the composition ofspending:doesmore spending on primary rather than ter-tiary health activities have a different impacton mortality? The cross-national statisticalevidence is weak.136A fourth strand investi-gates factors that might modulate the effec-tiveness ofpublic spending.It ﬁnds that cor-ruption,governance,or urbanization mightplay a role,but the results are inconsistentfrom one analysis to another.137Two methodological issues are importantfor interpreting these analyses.First,the sam-ple ofcountries in a study affects the results.A sample ofa few countries that have spent alot and achieved a lot—and a few countriesthat have spent little and achieved little—willyield a signiﬁcant association between morespending and lower mortality.A differentsample might yield no association.The num-ber ofcountries in studies that haveaddressed this question varies dramatically—from 22 to 116—so different results shouldnot be surprising.138Second,the speciﬁcation in the analysiscan change the assessment ofthe result.Forexample,controlling for adult literacy inaddition to income in the associations illus-trated in ﬁgure 2.4 yields an association and asigniﬁcance level that are even closer to zero.The message from these studies is not thatpublic funding cannot be successful.It is thatcommitment and appropriate policies,backed by public spending,can achieve a lot.Infant mortality was high in Thailand in 1970at 74 per 1,000 births,and the use ofcommu-nity hospitals and health centers was low,inpart because quality was low.But the govern-ment’s commitment to reduce infant mortal-ity was strong.Health planners took stock,analyzing information on service use andfrom household surveys.Thailand doubledreal per capita public spending on healthbetween the early 1970s and the mid-1980s.But it also did more.It built facilities inremote areas,directed more services to poorareas and poor people,improved stafftrain-ing,provided incentives for doctors to locatein remote areas,and promoted communityinvolvement in managing health care deliv-ery.The oversight ofdoctors was strength-ened.And the authority for various programswas devolved to the provincial level,freeingthe central Ministry ofPublic Health to con-centrate on planning,coordination,and tech-nical support.By 1985 infant mortality hadfallen to 42 per 1,000 births,and today it is 28per 1,000.139Similar stories are playing out 20years later in other parts ofthe developingworld.Public spending on services fails to reach poor peopleMost poor people do not get their fair shareofpublic spending on services,let alone thelarger share that might be justiﬁed onequity grounds.Public expenditure inci-dence analysis—matching who uses pub-licly ﬁnanced services with how much gov-ernments spend per user—provides asnapshot ofwho beneﬁts from governmentspending.Results typically show that the38WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Figure 2.4The association between outcomes and public spending is weak, when controllingfor national income* Public spending, child mortality rate, and primary school completion are given as the percent deviation from rate pre-dicted by GDP per capita.

Governments should make services work39poorest ﬁfth ofthe populace receives lessthan a ﬁfth ofeducation or health expendi-tures,while the richest ﬁfth receives more.In Ghana for example,the poorest ﬁfthreceived only 12 percent ofpublic expendi-tures on health in 1994,whereas the richestﬁfth received 33 percent (ﬁgure 2.5).One reason for this imbalance is thatspending is skewed to services dispropor-tionately used by richer people.Publicspending on primary education tends toreach poor people.The poorest ﬁfth ofArmenians got almost 30 percent ofthebeneﬁt ofpublic spending on primary edu-cation in 1999.But not all spending on pri-mary services is pro-poor.While publicspending on primary health care tends to bemore pro-poor than overall spending,itdoes not always disproportionately reachthe poor.The poorest ﬁfth ofthe populacein Côte d’Ivoire beneﬁted from only 14 per-cent ofpublic spending on primary healthfacilities in 1995 (compared with 11 percentfrom all health spending).14002040Guyana 1994Georgia 2000Brazil (NE&SE) 1997Moldova  2001Tajikistan 1999Argentina 1991Honduras 1995Costa Rica 1992Colombia 1992South Africa 1994Nicaragua 1998Sri Lanka 1996Kenya (rural) 1992Bulgaria 1995Bangladesh 2000Vietnam 1993Indonesia 1990Tanzania 1993Madagascar 1993Côte d‘Ivoire 1995India 1996Ghana 1994Ecuador 1998Armenia 1999India (UP) 1996Guinea 19940204002040Mauritania 1996Colombia 1992Jamaica 1998Romania 1994Ghana 1992Kenya 1992Panama 1997Mexico 1996Vietnam 1998Azerbaijan 2001Yemen 1998Peru 1994Morocco 1999Ecuador 1998Malawi 1995Brazil (NE&SE)1997Kazakhstan 1996Kyrgyz Rep. 1993Armenia 1996Pakistan 1991Cambodia 1997Indonesia 1989Uganda 1992–93Bangladesh 2000Lao PDR 1993Nicaragua 1998Côte d‘Ivoire 1995South Africa 1994Tanzania 1994FYR Macedonia 1996Kosovo 2000Madagascar 1994Guinea 1994Nepal 1996Guyana 1993Costa Rica 2001PercentPercent02040PercentPercentAll health spendingPrimary health onlyAll education spendingPrimary education onlyRichest fifthPoorest fifthNote:Figure reports most recent available data.Source:Filmer 2003b.Figure 2.5Richer people often beneﬁt more from public spending on health and educationShare of public spending on health and education going to the richest and poorest ﬁfths05_WDR_Ch02.qxd  8/14/03  7:50 AM  Page 39(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Orienting public spending toward servicesused by poor people helps,but it does nothelp unless the spending reaches the frontline,where it beneﬁts poor people.A study inUganda found that in the early 1990s only 13percent ofgovernment primary educationcapitation grants made it to the intended des-tination,primary schools.The rest went topurposes unrelated to education or to privategain.Poor students suffered disproportion-ately,as schools catering to them received evensmaller shares ofthe grants (see spotlight).141The story in health is the same.Drugsintended for health clinics often never getthere.In the mid-1980s more than 70 percentofthe government’s supply ofdrugs disap-peared in Guinea.142Studies in Cameroon,Tanzania,and Uganda estimated that 30 per-cent ofpublicly supplied drugs were misap-propriated—in one case as much as 40 per-cent were “withdrawn for private use.”143Private and public sectors interactPublic spending has trouble creating qualityservices and reaching poor people.So why besurprised that spending is only weakly associ-ated with outcomes? But there is another rea-son for the weak association:private andpublic sectors interact,and what matters isthe net impact on the use ofservices.Increas-ing public provision may simply crowd out,in whole or in part,equally effective servicesobtained from nongovernment providers.This works through two channels.First,individual demand in both public and pri-vate sectors will respond to a change in thepublic sector.A review ofthe impact ofpriceincreases in public health clinics in sevencountries found that a substantial percentageofvisits to public providers deterred by priceincreases are redirected to private ones—although the magnitude ofthe effect variesacross settings.144Second,private providersmay respond to changes in public provision.An experiment in increasing fees in publicfacilities in Indonesia in the early 1990sfound that the number ofprivate dispen-saries and hospitals increased substantially,and that this resulted in only small changes inhealth outcomes.145Unless resources support services thatwork for poor people,they will be ineffective.The efﬁcacy ofspending is so varied that it ishard to associate a cost with achieving anytarget improvement in outcomes,as with theMillennium Development Goals (box 2.3).Technical adjustments without changes in incentivesare not enoughIfmore public money is spent on services—and more ofthat money is spent on servicesused by poor people and makes it to theintended school or clinic—how the money isused still determines its efﬁcacy.Considerrecurrent spending on education in Sub-Saharan Africa.Of18 populous Sub-SaharanAfrican countries with data,most spend sub-stantially more than the recommended 66percent on teachers (ﬁgure 2.6).146And thisisn’t just a central government phenomenon.In Nigeria wages account for about 90 per-cent oflocal government recurrent expendi-tures on primary education.No one woulddeny that teachers are a key part oftheschooling process and that paying them ade-quately is important.But ifthere is no moneyleft to pay for other important inputs,such astextbooks,learning will suffer.Why does such a large share ofeducationspending go to teachers? Spending on teach-ers is the result ofbalancing technical issueswith political jockeying by parents,teachers,the rest ofthe civil service,and advocates ofspending priorities outside ofthe educationsector.Spending on other inputs often losesout to spending on teachers—who are oftenvocal,organized,connected,and contractu-ally obligated to be paid.It happens wherespending is fairly high—Kenya spends morethan 6 percent ofGDP on education—andfairly low—Tanzania spends less than 2 per-cent ofGDP on education.The purpose isnot to single out Sub-Saharan Africa—thephenomenon is widespread—or to pick onteachers.It is to suggest that ﬁxing the prob-lem requires dealing not just with technicalor managerial questions ofhow much tospend on one input relative to others,butwith the institutional and political contextsthat generate these decisions in the ﬁrst place.Identifying what contributes to an effec-tive classroom or appropriate medical treat-ment is important for decisionmaking.Inwell-functioning systems service provision40WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Kenya 96%Madagascar 58% D.R.

Governments should make services work41can be improved through better teachingmaterials,more reliable availability ofdrugs,better training ofhealth workers—that is,through technical improvements in the prox-imate determinants ofsuccessful service pro-vision.And management reforms mayreduce the frequency ofshirking teachers orincompetent doctors or corrupt police.Buttrying to make services work in weak systemsby an effective and least-cost solution—applying a codiﬁed set ofactions or simplytraining providers—will end in frustration ifpoliticians do not listen to citizens or ifproviders have no incentive to perform well.How much will it cost to reach the MillenniumDevelopment Goals? That question,crucial for gov-ernments and donors who have committed to thegoals,is extremely difﬁcult to answer.What cost?For universal primary educationcompletion,does “costing”mean putting a price tagon enrolling all primary-age children in publicschools? With more than 100 million children of pri-mary school age not in school,multiplying the num-ber in each country by average public spending perprimary student yields a total “cost”of about $10 bil-lion.But this number overlooks a simple point:chil-dren not in school might be harder to induce tocome to school,so the marginal cost of enrolling achild could be higher than the average cost.Thesechildren might have higher opportunity costs,so itmight require a larger subsidy to get them intoschool.Or they might live in remote areas,where itwould cost more to build schools or to compensatethem for traveling to more central locations.In addi-tion,this approach implicitly assumes that spendingon a particular target can be earmarked separatelyfrom other spending in the sector.Though that ispossible,it is not easy.Efﬁciency gains.The average cost calculationalso ignores the weak overall association betweenspending and outcomes.Additional spending will beassociated with only small increases in outcomes ifthe additional funds are spent with the averageobserved efﬁciency (ﬁgure 2.4).That means it willtake astronomically high amounts to achieve thegoals.But what if the money is “well spent”? A country-by-country simulation of spending in47 low-income countries adjusted the proximatedeterminants of primary completion success—pub-lic spending as a share of GDP,the share of spendingthat goes to teachers,the level of teacher salaries,pupil-teacher ratio,average repetition rate.It foundthat average external resources of about $2.8 billiona year would be needed.(Since the simulationincluded domestically mobilized resources as a pol-icy lever,the model yields the amount of externalresources required).147The average-cost approach toenrolling out-of-school children in these 47countries yields a total incremental cost of $3.1 bil-lion a year.148“Costing”a change in proximate determinants isuseful for identifying the ﬁscal implications of achange in policy,but it says little about the successor failure of turning that spending into outcomes.This does not mean “if this amount of money werespent,the Millennium Development Goals will bemet.”It means “if the goals are met,here is what itwill have cost.”Financing transitional costs.If institutionalreforms are necessary for sustainable improvementsin outcomes,the costs of those reforms should becounted:for example,the cost of repurposing physi-cal infrastructure or compensating redundant staff.These costs are determined by country conditions.For example,the cost of a severance package willdepend on a country’s labor market,civil service reg-ulations and norms,and other local factors.Giventhe uncertainty surrounding costs,it makes littlesense to estimate transitional costs on a global basis.Interdependence and double counting.Progress on each Millennium Development Goalfeeds back into the others.Safe water and good sani-tation contribute to better health.Good healthenhances the productivity of schooling.Educationpromotes better health.Interventions that promoteone goal promote all of them.If the cost of reachingeach goal is assessed independently,and the resultsare totaled across goals,there is double counting.149Multiple determinants.But the goals do notjust depend on each other—their determinants aremultiple,cutting across many sectors.Little is knownabout the relative contribution of each factor to out-comes or about the magnitude of potential interac-tion effects (see crate 1.1 in chapter 1).For example,the impact of sanitation on mortality depends onaccess to safe water.The effectiveness of vaccines,and thus their contribution to lowering mortality,depend on preserving the “cold chain,”whichdepends on roads,other transport,and energy infra-structure.Precise estimates of these independentand interactive effects are not easy to come by.In sum,costing the goals requires an estimatethat distinguishes between marginal and averagecost,incorporates the policy and institutionalchanges required to make this additional expendi-ture effective,does not double- or triple-count giventhe interdependence of the goals,and takes intoaccount the multiple determinants of each goal.Nowonder that coming up with costs of reaching thegoals is so difﬁcult.BOX 2.3Why it’s so hard to “cost”the Millennium Development Goals05_WDR_Ch02.qxd  8/14/03  7:51 AM  Page 41(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

To understand why,it is important to dis-tinguish between institutional and manage-rial reforms.Reducing teacher absenteeismfrom 9 percent to 7 percent is a managementissue;reducing teacher absenteeism from 50percent to 9 percent is an institutional issue.Improving diagnostic recognition ofspeciﬁcdiseases is a management issue.Reducingwidespread mistreatment ofroutine condi-tions is an institutional issue.Institutional reforms seek to strengthenthe relationships ofaccountability amongvarious actors so that good service provisionoutputs emerge—with all their proximatedeterminants,including active management.Institutional arrangements need to takeadvantage ofthe strengths ofthe market—with its strong customer responsiveness,organizational autonomy,and systemic pres-sures for efﬁciency and innovation.And thestrengths ofthe public sector—with itsability to address equity and market failuresand its power to enforce standards.This isnot about reducing or avoiding key publicresponsibilities.It is about creating newways to meet public responsibilities moreeffectively.This might include alternativesto public production,but it could just aseasily include institutionalchanges to makepublic agencies perform better.Understanding what works andwhy—to improve servicesTo produce better health,better skills,andbetter standards ofliving,service beneﬁcia-ries,providers,and the state must worktogether.How? Understanding what works,why,in what context—and how to spreadsuccessful approaches—is the subject ofthis Report.Many successful institutionalinnovations worldwide show clearly thatservices need not fail.They offer lessons toguide replication and to scale up solutions.A variety ofstories illustrate the potential—and the challenge.Citizen report cards in Bangalore,India.In the early 1990s public services in Kar-nataka’s capital city were in bad shape.Atechnology boom unleashed rapid growth.Services were oflow quality and corruptionwas rampant,affecting all income groups.To monitor the government’s failure toaddress these problems,and to motivatechange,a civil society group introducedreport cards in 1994 rating user experienceswith public services.The results—revealingpoor quality,petty corruption,lack ofaccess for slum dwellers,and the hiddencosts ofoutwardly cheap services—werewidely publicized by an active press.The report cards gradually opened a dia-logue between providers and user groups—and eventually got a positive response fromthe managers ofpublic agencies.The state’schiefminister set up a task force to improvecity governance.Follow-up activities—suchas an in-depth report card for hospitals—delved deeper into problems with individ-ual services.In 1999 a report card ratedsome services substantially higher,thoughscores on corruption and access to griev-ance systems remained low.The initiativewas so successful that the Public AffairsCentre (which conducted the survey) col-laborated with local partners to preparesimilar studies in other Indian cities.150Andother countries (the Philippines,Ukraine,and Vietnam) are adopting the approach.Participatory budget formulation in PortoAlegre,Brazil.The city ofPorto Alegre,with a population ofmore than a million,developed an innovative model ofbudgetformulation.Citizen associations proposeprojects,which are then publicly debated.The proposals are combined with technicalassessments,and the procedure is repeatedto determine ﬁnal budget allocations.Thecity made substantial strides.Access towater went from 80 percent in 1989 to nearuniversal in 1996,and access to sewerage,from less than 50 percent to 85 percent.School enrollments doubled.And withgreater citizen willingness to pay for betterservices,city revenue increased by 50 per-cent.To make the process pro-poor,thepoorest people had more voting power thanothers.The approach has proved a resound-ing success for the inhabitants (and for thepolitical party,which repeatedly won elec-tions).Several other cities have sinceadopted similar procedures.151Different stories point to other innova-tions:greater transparency ofschool fund-42WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 200405_WDR_Ch02.qxd  8/14/03  7:51 AM  Page 42(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

ing in Uganda,citywide reform in Johan-nesburg,South Africa,cash transfers tohouseholds in Mexico,statewide reform ofhealth services in Ceará,Brazil (see spot-lights).Only one ofthese innovations wasevaluated using an experimental design(Mexico’s Progresa).And not all have clearmeasures ofchange in outputs or out-comes.But all hint at ways forward.The various stories raise questions.Whywere the innovations implemented? Whomdid they affect? What made them work—and what makes some other innovationsfail? Can they be replicated? To examinethese questions systematically—that is,tolearn from such examples—the Reportdevelops a framework that incorporates themain actors—service beneﬁciaries,thestate,and providers—and describes howeach is linked by relationships ofaccount-ability (chapters 3 to 6).It then appliesthese principles to speciﬁc reform agendas,exploring how those relationships play outin different sectors (chapters 7 to 11).Governments should make services work4305_WDR_Ch02.qxd  8/14/03  7:52 AM  Page 43(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Spotlight on Kerala and Uttar Pradesh45By contrast,in Uttar Pradesh caste andclass-based divisions,and the absence ofcompelling political alternatives to tran-scend these divisions,led to poor politicalincentives for effective provision ofuniver-sal,basic services.Political competitionrevolved around access to instruments ofthe state to deliver patronage and publicemployment to speciﬁc clients.Publicexpenditures in the early years were accord-ingly concentrated in state administrationand remained well above expenditures onhealth and education.More recently,politi-cal parties have tended to underplay theprogram or policy content oftheir plat-forms,and instead have publicized the eth-nic proﬁle oftheir candidate lists todemonstrate commitment to proportionalrepresentation ofethnic groups in thebureaucratic institutions ofthe state.159Breaking out of vicious cyclesPublic action can build on history,breakfrom it,or perpetuate it.Individuals’abili-ties to press their demands depend on theirinformation,perceived rights,and literacy.Public action—by inﬂuencing informationthat citizens have,their legal protections,and their schooling—inﬂuences privatefood distribution,and social securitydiffer sharply in scope,access,quality,and equitable incidence.In UttarPradesh these services appear to havebeen widely neglected and there hasbeen no particular effort to ensureresults,particularly in schools.•A more literate and better informedpublic in Kerala was active in politicsand public affairs in a way that did notappear to have happened in UttarPradesh.•Informed citizen action and politicalactivism in Kerala—building partly onmass literacy and the emphasis placedon universal services by early commu-nist and subsequent coalition govern-ments—seem to have been crucial inorganizing poor people.In UttarPradesh traditional caste and powerdivisions,particularly in rural areas,have persisted through more than 50years ofelectoral politics—and suchdivisions have come to form the coreofpolitical discourse and clientelistpolitics.Political incentives matter for servicedelivery and actual development out-comes.158Delivering broad,universal basicservices has remained a credible politicalplatform in Kerala in contrast to the clien-telist,caste,and class-driven politics ofUttarPradesh.In Kerala,early governments with eco-nomic platforms emphasizing the provi-sion ofuniversal basic services establisheda political agenda that remained importantin the coalition politics that followed.Political competition conditioned onpromises to deliver better basic servicesshowed up in early budget allocations (ﬁg-ure 1):education and health servicesaccounted for a much higher share ofpub-lic expenditures as compared to what wasspent on state administration.action,especially by the politically weak.And private action loops back to inﬂuencepublic action.One set ofreforms can leadto further institutional evolution.A societycan be caught in a vicious cycle,as in UttarPradesh,or be propelled by a virtuous one,as in Kerala.As Dreze and Gazdar note:“InUttar Pradesh,the social failures ofthe stateare quite daunting,but the potentialrewards ofaction are correspondingly high,and the costs ofcontinued inertia evenhigher.”160As for Kerala,despite the many eco-nomic problems that linger and the newones that have appeared,the remarkablerescript issued in 1817 by Gowri ParvathiBai,the 15-year-old queen ofthe erstwhilestate ofTranvancore,certainly seems tohave come true in its bold aspirations forthe human development ofher subjects.The rescript read:“The state should defray the entire costofthe education ofits people in order thatthere might be no backwardness in thespread ofenlightenment among them,thatby diffusion ofeducation they mightbecome better subjects and public servantsand that the reputation ofthe state mightbe enhanced thereby.”161Figure 1Kerala spent more on education and health, Uttar Pradesh on state administration1019551959197130204050Percent of total public expenditures196319671975197919831987199119951999Education and health (Kerala)Education and health (Uttar Pradesh)State administration (Kerala)State administration (Uttar Pradesh)Note:Public spending on state administration does not include interest payments.Source:Reserve Bank of India Bulletins, 1955–1998.06_pgs 44-45_Ch02Spotlight.qxd  8/14/03  1:48 PM  Page 45(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

46The public sector has generally taken onresponsibility for the delivery ofservicesand frequently used civil service bureaucra-cies as the instrument.This approach hashad dramatic successes and—as chapter 1documented—far too many failures.Muchremains to be done.Particularly for poorpeople,there are widespread challenges inproviding affordable access,ﬁxing dysfunc-tional facilities,improving technical quality,increasing client responsiveness,and raisingproductivity.As chapter 2 noted,neithereconomic growth,nor simply increasingpublic spending,nor coming up with tech-nocratic solutions is enough to meet thischallenge.The failures in service provision havenot gone unnoticed.Indeed,there is acacophony ofproposed institutional solu-tions:civil service reform,privatization,democratization,decentralization,con-tracting out,provision through NGOs,empowerment,participatory methods,social funds,community-driven develop-ment,user associations.With each ofthese solutions comes a bewildering vari-ety oftechniques and instruments:demand-side transfers,participatory ruralappraisals,facility surveys,service scorecards,participatory budgets.None is apanacea.“One size does not ﬁt all”is a truism butnot very helpful.Everyone wanting toimprove services for poor people—fromthe poor themselves to reform-mindedprofessionals,advocates,political leaders,and external agencies—asks:What size ﬁtsme?Given the capabilities,resources,poli-tics,and incentives that I face,what can bedone? What are the actions that wouldimprove services for poor people in mycircumstances? To evaluate alternativeThe framework for service provision3chapterarrangements for the provision ofservicesrequires an encompassing framework—toanalyze which ofthe many items on themenu ofservice reform is right for thetime,place,and circumstance.This Report’s framework starts from thespeciﬁc and works to the general.Start witha child in a classroom,a pregnant womanat a clinic,someone turning a tap for water.Each is seeking a service,and the proximatedeterminants ofsuccess are clear.For anyindividual service transaction to be suc-cessful,there needs to be a frontlineprovider who is capable,who has access toadequate resources and inputs,and who ismotivated to pursue an achievable goal.The general question:what institutionalconditions support the emergence ofcapa-ble,motivated frontline providers withclear objectives and adequate resources?The answer:successful services for poorpeople emerge from institutional relation-ships in which the actors are accountable toeach other.(Please be patient,the rest ofthe Report works out exactly what that sen-tence means.) This chapter does ﬁve things.It intro-duces the analytical framework ofactors(individuals,organizations,governments,businesses) and relationships ofaccount-ability that will be used throughout theReport.It describes the characteristics ofservices that make creating those relation-ships so crucial—and so difﬁcult.It uses theframework and the characteristics oftheservices to analyze why pure public sectorproduction often fails—and why pure pri-vatization is not the answer.It lays out howthe various items on the agenda for servicereform are related and how the Report willaddress them.And it addresses the dynam-ics ofreform.07_WDR_Ch03.qxd  8/14/03  7:56 AM  Page 46(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

The framework for service provision47An analytical framework:actors and accountabilitiesLanguage evolves through common usage,so no one is accountable when the wordaccountabilityacquires so many differentuses and meanings.What this Report meansby accountability is a relationship amongactors that has ﬁve features:delegation,ﬁnance,performance,information about per-formance,andenforceability (ﬁgure 3.1).Relationships ofaccountability can be assimple as buying a sandwich or taking ajob—and as complex as running a munici-pal democracy.•In buying a sandwich you ask for it (del-egation) and pay for it (ﬁnance).Thesandwich is made for you (performance).You eat the sandwich (which generatesrelevant informationabout its quality).And you then choose to buy or not buy asandwich another day (enforceability),affecting the proﬁts ofthe seller.•In a typical employment relationship aperson is given a set oftasks (delegation)and paid a wage (ﬁnance).The employeeworks (performance).The contribution ofthe employee is assessed (information).And based on that information,theemployer acts to reinforce good or dis-courage bad performance (enforceability).•In a city the citizens choose an executiveto manage the tasks ofthe municipality(delegation),including tax and budgetdecisions (ﬁnance).The executive acts,often in ways that involve the executivein relationships ofaccountability withothers (performance).Voters then assessthe executive’s performance based ontheir experience and information.Andthey act to control the executive—eitherpolitically or legally (enforceability).There are many other vocabularies forreferring to these pervasive and criticalissues from a variety ofdisciplines (eco-nomics,political science,sociology) andpractices (public administration,manage-ment).This Report makes no claims ofcoming up with a superior set ofwords.Theterms here have the virtues ofcompleteness(a name for everything the Report dis-cusses) and consistency (the same namesare used throughout).See box 3.1 for a glos-sary ofterms used in this Report.Forinstance,recent work on the empowermentofpoor people,extending the work ofthe2000/2001 World Development Reportonpoverty,suggests four elements that overlapin important ways with the analysis here:access to information,inclusion and partic-ipation,accountability,and local organiza-tional capacity.162Others use the termaccountabilityto refer only to the dimensionof“answerability”(getting informationabout performance) or to “enforceability.”This Report uses the term broadly.There are two motivations for thisbroader approach.First,weaknesses in anyaspect ofaccountability can cause failure.One cannot strengthen enforceability—holding providers responsible for outputsand outcomes—in isolation.Ifprovidersdo not receive clear delegation,preciselyspecifying the desired objectives,increas-ing enforceability is unfair and ineffective.Ifproviders are not given adequateresources,holding them accountable forpoor outcomes is again unfair and ineffec-tive.Second,putting ﬁnance as the ﬁrststep in creating a relationship ofaccount-ability stresses that simply caring about anoutcome controlled by another does notcreate a relationship ofaccountability.Tobe a “stakeholder”you need to put up astake.In the chain ofservice delivery the Reportdistinguishes four broad roles:•Citizens/clients.Patients,students,par-ents,voters.•Politicians/policymakers.Prime ministers,presidents,parliamentarians,mayors,ministers ofﬁnance,health,education.•Organizational providers.Health depart-ments,education departments,waterand sanitation departments.•Frontline professionals.Doctors,nurses,teachers,engineers.In the ideal situation these actors arelinked in relationships ofpower andaccountability.Citizens exercise voice overpoliticians.Policymakers have compactsFigure 3.1The relationships of accountability have ﬁve features Actors(principals)including clients, citizens, policy-makersAccountableactors(agents)includingpolicy-makers,providersDelegatingFinancingPerformingInformingEnforcing07_WDR_Ch03.qxd  8/14/03  7:57 AM  Page 47(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

48WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Language is elastic—an asset reﬂecting thediversity of human experience,but a liabilitywhen such overused terms as accountabilitylose their meaning.This Report,in developing itsservice delivery framework,gives somecommonly used terms (such as accountability)speciﬁc meaning and we coin a few new terms.We do not claim we have superior or bettermeanings,but we do try for internal consistency.Accountabilityis a set of relationshipsamong service delivery actors with ﬁve features:•Delegating:Explicit or implicit understand-ing that a service (or goods embodying the ser-vice) will be supplied.•Financing.Providing the resources to enablethe service to be provided or paying for it.•Performing.Supplying the actual service.•Having information about performance.Obtaining relevant information and evaluatingperformance against expectations and formal orinformal norms.•Enforcing.Being able to impose sanctions forinappropriate performance or provide rewardswhen performance is appropriate.This Report deﬁnes four relationships ofaccountability:client power (over providers),com-pacts,management (by provider organizations offrontline professionals),and voice and politics(between citizens and politicians/policymakers).Actors:Individuals,households,communi-ties,ﬁrms,governments,and other public,non-governmental,and private organizations thatﬁnance,produce,regulate,deliver,or consumeservices.In economic theory the actors whohold others accountable are sometimes calledprincipals,and the actors who are held account-able are called agents.Client power:The relationship of account-ability connecting clients to the frontline serviceproviders,usually at the point of service deliv-ery,based on transactions through which clientsexpress their demand for services and can mon-itor supply and providers.Clients/citizens:Service users who as citi-zens participate individually or in groups (e.g.,labor unions) in political processes to shape andattain collective goals.As clients,individualsreceive services to satisfy their householddemand.All clients are citizens (in most settings)but,depending on the service,not all citizensare clients.Clientelism:The tendency of politicians aspatrons to respond to political competition byexcessively favoring one group of clients overanother in return for political advantage (votebanks).Providing narrow supporter groups withfree public services or public employment,par-ticularly where shirking is not sanctioned,isoften the way politicians practice clientelism.Compacts:The broad,long-term relationshipof accountability connecting policymakers toorganizational providers.This is usually not as spe-ciﬁc or legally enforceable as a contract.But anexplicit,veriﬁable contract can be one form of acompact.Discretionary services:Locally producedservices,such as classroom instruction or cura-tive care,where the teacher or doctor must exer-cise signiﬁcant judgment on what to deliver andhow,and where clients typically have a largeinformation deﬁcit relative to the provider.Dis-cretionary services that are transaction-intensiveare hard to monitor,both for the client and forthe policymaker,whether publicly or privatelyprovided.They pose particular challenges for allthe relationships of accountability.Frontline professionals:The teachers,nurses,doctors,engineers,clerks,or other providers whocome in direct contact with the client.Long and short routes of accountability:Clients may seek to hold service providersaccountable for performance in two ways.Clientpower connecting clients and providers is thedirect,“short”route of accountability.When suchclient power is weak or not possible to use,clients must use voice and politics in their roleas citizens to hold politicians accountable—andpolitician/policymakers must in turn use thecompact to do the same with providers.Thecombination of the two is the roundabout,“long”route of accountability.Management:The relationship of account-ability connecting organizational providersand frontline professionals,comprising internalprocesses for public and private organizationsto select,train,motivate,administer,and evalu-ate frontline professionals.These processesmay be rule-bound in large bureaucracies,oridiosyncratic and ad hoc in small,privateproviders.Organizational providers:Public,privatenonproﬁt,and private for-proﬁt entities thatactually provide services.These may range fromgovernment line ministries with hundreds ofthousands of employees to a private hospitalchain or from a vast urban water utility to a sin-gle,community-run,village school.Politicians/policymakers:The service deliv-ery actors authorized by the state to dischargeits legislative,regulatory,and rule-makingresponsibilities.Politicians may be elected orachieve their positions through nondemocraticmeans.They can also be policymakers (the gen-eral who is president but also runs the military,the telecom minister who administers the saleof frequencies).But more commonly policymak-ers are the highest nonelected ofﬁcials—eitherfrom a civil service or appointed.Politicians setgeneral directions.Policymakers implementthese directions and set and enforce the condi-tions for public and private service providers tooperate.Usually accountability subrelationshipsbetween politicians and policymakers (parodiedin the TV serial “Yes Minister”) are derived fromthe constitution,administrative law,or rules ofpublic administration.Service delivery framework (or chain):Thefour service-related actors—citizens/clients,politicians/policymakers,organizationalproviders,frontline professionals—and the fourrelationships of accountabilitythat connectthem:•Voice and politics:connecting citizens andpoliticians.•Compacts:connecting politicians/policy-makers and providers.•Management:connecting provider organiza-tions with frontline professionals.•Client power:connecting clients withproviders.•Short route of accountability:See long andshort routes of accountability.Strategic incrementalism:Pragmatic incre-mental reforms in weak institutionalenvironments that are not likely to fully addressservice delivery problems but can alleviate acuteservice problems while at the same time creat-ing the conditions for deeper and morefavorable change—say,building capacity thatcan respond to service delivery challenges.Thiscan be contrasted with,for lack of a better term,“incremental incrementalism”that merely solvesone set of immediate problems but creates oth-ers.For example,working around existing gov-ernment and governance structures with nostrategy for how these temporary measures willaffect the long term.Transaction-intensive services:Services thatrequire repeated,frequent client-provider contact.Transaction-intensive services may bediscretionary and require constant,minute deci-sions (classroom teaching),making them very hardto monitor.Or the technology may not requiremuch discretion (ﬁre and forget) once there isclient contact (immunization).Voice and politics:The most complex rela-tionship of accountability.It connects citizensand politicians and comprises many formal andinformal processes,including voting and elec-toral politics,lobbying and propaganda,patron-age and clientelism,media activities,access toinformation,and so on.Citizens delegate topoliticians the functions of serving their inter-ests and ﬁnancing governments through theirtaxes.Politicians perform by providing services,such as law and order or communities relativelyfree of pathogens.Citizens enforce accountabil-ity through elections and other less deﬁnitivemeans,such as advocacy,legal actions,andnaming and shaming campaigns.BOX 3.1A glossary for this Report07_WDR_Ch03.qxd  8/14/03  7:57 AM  Page 48(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

The framework for service provision49with organizational providers.Organiza-tions manage frontline providers.Andclients exercise client powerthrough inter-actions with frontline providers (ﬁgure3.2).In low-income countries a ﬁfth role,played by external ﬁnance agencies,affectseach ofthese relationships (chapter 11).Weaknesses in anyofthe relationships—or in the capacity ofthe actors—can resultin service failures.Providers can be madedirectly accountable to clients (as in markettransactions) by passing decisions and pow-ers directly to citizens or communities—a“short route”ofaccountability.But,moretypically,the public sector is involved,sotwo key relationships—voice and com-pacts—make up the main control mecha-nism ofthe citizen in a “long route”ofaccountability.In either case,organizations(such as health,education,and waterdepartments) need to be able to managefrontline providers.The four actorsCitizens and clients.Individuals andhouseholds have dual roles,as citizens andas direct clients.As citizens they participateboth as individuals and through coalitions(communities,political parties,laborunions,business associations) in politicalprocesses that deﬁne collective objectives;they also strive to control and direct publicaction in accomplishing those objectives.Asdirect clients ofservice providers,individu-als and households hope to get clean water,have their children educated,and protectthe health oftheir family.The role ofcitizens and clients as servicebeneﬁciaries does not imply that all citizensare alike or have the same views.Terms suchas civil societyand community are some-times used too casually.People differ inbeliefs,hopes,values,identities,and capa-bilities.Civil society is often not civil at all;many “communities”have little in com-mon.Individuals and households may dis-agree about collective objectives and workto promote their own views,both individu-ally and through associations,sometimes atthe direct expense ofothers.The capabilityfor collective action ofcitizens,a key ele-ment ofservice delivery,varies widelyacross societies.Politicians and policymakers.What dis-tinguishes the sovereign state from all otherinstitutions is its monopoly on the legiti-mate use ofphysical force within its bound-aries.From this monopoly,politiciansderive the power to regulate,to legislate,totax—to set and enforce the “rules ofthegame.”Politicians are deﬁned here as thosewho control this power and discharge thefundamental responsibilities ofthe state.This does not mean that electoral politicsare always in play:some politicians areheads ofone-party states,some haveimposed their control through militaryforce,some arrive by election.In some sys-tems executive politicians are dominant—in others,legislative politicians.The other actors who exercise the powerofthe state are policymakers.In some coun-tries politicians are also policymakers.Butin others there is a clear distinction betweenthe highest nonelected ofﬁcials ofgovern-ment—civil servants or appointees—andpolitical actors.Politicians set general direc-tions,but policymakers set the fundamentalrules ofthe game for service providers tooperate—by regulating entry,enforcingstandards,and determining the conditionsunder which providers receive public funds.Organizational providers.A providerorganization can be a public line organiza-tion,whatever the name—ministry,depart-ment,agency,bureau (table 3.1).It can be aministry ofeducation that provides educa-tion services,an autonomous public enter-prise (autonomous public hospitals),aFigure 3.2Key relationships of powerVoiceCompactThe statePoliticiansPolicymakersCitizens/clientsClient powerNonpoorPoorLongrouteofaccountabilityProvidersFrontlineOrganizationsManagementShortrouteCoalitions/inclusionServices07_WDR_Ch03.qxd  8/14/03  7:57 AM  Page 49(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

The framework for service provision51Ofthe organizational provider to the state:compacts.The relationships between pol-icymakers and service providers can bethought ofas compacts.The compact is notalways as speciﬁc and legally enforceable asa contract,though a contract can be oneform ofa compact.Instead,it is a broadagreement about a long-term relationship.The policymaker provides resources anddelegates powers and responsibility for col-lective objectives to the service providers.The policymaker generates informationabout the performance oforganizations.Enforceability comes into play when thecompact also speciﬁes the rewards (andpossibly the penalties) that depend on theservice provider’s actions and outputs.Theline between “the state”and “public sectororganizational provider”is not always easyto draw.Ofthe frontline professionals to the organi-zational provider: management.In everyorganization,formal and informal tools ofmanagement provide frontline workerswith assignments and delineated areas ofresponsibility,equipping them with theresources to act.In public agencies thismanagement function is at times blurredbecause providers are employees of“thegovernment.”But all the standard manage-ment issues ofselecting,training,and moti-vating workers in an organization apply toall organizations—private,NGO,govern-ment,whatever.All service provision orga-nizations—whether a government min-istry,a religious body,a nonproﬁt NGO,ora for-proﬁt ﬁrm—have to create a relation-ship ofaccountability with their frontlineproviders.Ofthe provider to the citizen-client: clientpower.Because the policymaker cannotspecify all actions ofproviders in the com-pact,citizens must reveal to providers theirdemand for services and monitor theproviders’provision ofservices.Clients andorganizational providers interact throughthe individuals who provide services—teachers,doctors,engineers,repairmen—the frontline professionals and frontlineworkers.Accountability is not the only relationship The foregoing description is not reality,because it portrays only one direction in therelationships between actors.The reality isthat actors are embedded in a complex setofrelationships,and accountability is notalways the most important.Through vari-ous forms ofcoercion,both subtle and bla-tant,many states’ability to impose obliga-tionson citizens has proved much strongerthan the ability ofcitizens to disciplinepoliticians and policymakers (box 3.2).Andin many cases citizens approach the stateand its agents as supplicants.Politicians often use the control overpublicly provided services as a mechanismofclientelism—for both citizens andproviders.In systems that lack accountabil-ity relationships,public service jobs (teach-ers,policemen) are given as political favors,which creates a relationship not ofaccount-ability but ofpolitical obligation.A recentreport on education in Nepal,for instance,ﬁnds that “teachers’performance standardsare nonexistent.Most teachers are alignedwith one ofthe many associations formedon political party lines and appointmentand deployment practices are often deter-mined as a result ofindividual’s contribu-tions to political activities.”163Accountability is more a rubric than a singleitem,but it is a fruitful rubric for makinguseful distinctions.Political accountability is the willingnessof politicians and policymakers to justify theiractions and to accept electoral,legal,oradministrative penalties if their justiﬁcation isfound lacking.Even within “political”account-ability one can have distinctions.With verticalpolitical accountability,citizens individually orcollectively hold the state to account—say,through voting or advocacy.Democraciesmust have some vertical accountability.Withhorizontal political accountability,agents ofthe state formally hold another agent of thestate accountable—say,through the“compact”relationship between policymak-ers and providers.Authoritarian states may manifest con-siderable horizontal accountability (“thetrains run on time”),but not offer any verti-cal accountability.But where the relation-ship between clients and providers is verystrong (in some instances perhaps becauseof the omnipresence of the ruling party,asin Cuba),service delivery may work verywell without much vertical accountability.Even for a given type of accountabilitythere are distinctions.Formal horizontalpolitical accountability is the formaldescription of institutions,and authorityamong agents of the state.It may differsharply from informal horizontal politicalaccountability,from the actual working ofinstitutions and effective control over deci-sions in state organizations.Sources:Goetz and Jenkins (2002) and Aghionand Tirole (1997).BOX 3.2The many meanings ofaccountability07_WDR_Ch03.qxd  8/14/03  7:58 AM  Page 51(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

52WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Services are allocated in ways thatreward (or punish) communities for theirpolitical support.Sometimes the ministry isthe agent ofthe providers,not the otherway around,and providers capture the poli-cymaking.Providers also use their ability tocontrol services and their superior socialstatus to intimidate poor people.Ratherthan client power,there is provider power.The political scientist James Scott hasargued that the pressures of“authoritarianhigh modernism”can mean that the stateand its bureaucratic apparatus deﬁne a“thin simpliﬁcation”in order to carry outservices—but that the domination ofthisreality over citizens and their complex real-ity can lead to unintended consequences.Why establishing relationshipsof accountability is so complex This Report moves beyond what the publicsector should do and emphasizes how pub-lic action can be made most effective.Frontline workers have to have clear objec-tives,adequate resources,technical capabili-ties,and the motivation to create valuedservices.This cannot be mandated.It is theresult ofinteractions between strong actorsin each ofthe key service provision roles.The ideal:a state that is strong,not weak.Provider organizations that have a clearvision and mission ofservice provision,notones that are internally incoherent andmerely process oriented.Frontlineproviders acting with professional auton-omy and initiative,not tightly controlledautomatons.And empowered citizens whodemand services,not passive “recipients”who are acted on.Strong,capable actors need to be embed-ded in strong relationships ofaccountability.But it is difﬁcult to establish such relation-ships for these services.Why? •Because there are both collective objec-tives and private objectives,a system thatcreated only client power through choice(say) would meet only individual objec-tives,not the many public ones.•Because ofthe multiple,complex objec-tives ofpublic production and co-production,it is difﬁcult to create out-come-based enforceability for providers.Individual interests and collective objectivesA competitive market automatically createsaccountability ofsellers to buyers.The keyinformation is customer satisfaction,andthe key enforceability is the customer’schoice ofsupplier.Competitive marketshave proved a remarkably robust institu-tional arrangement for meeting individualinterests.But they are not enough for ser-vices—for three reasons.•First,the market responds only to thosewith purchasing power,doing nothing toensure universal access or an equitabledistribution,which societies often haveas a collective objective.•Second,the sum ofthe individual inter-ests may not produce the best outcomebecause markets may have failures ofvarious kinds.•Third,other collective objectives requirepublic action.For instance,the state andsociety have a strong concern about therole ofschooling in the socialization ofyouth and may not want parents tochoose for themselves.The problem ofmonitoringLocally produced services—basic educa-tion,health care,urban water supply andsanitation—have three characteristics thatmake it particularly difﬁcult to structurerelationships ofaccountability.They arediscretionary and transaction-intensive.There are multiple tasks and multiple prin-cipals.And it is difﬁcult to attribute out-comes.Discretionary and transaction-intensive.Services are transaction-intensive,and thetransactions require discretion.Teachersmust continuously decide about the paceand structure ofclassroom activity.Havethe ideas been grasped? Will another exam-ple reinforce the idea or bore the class? Adoctor has to make decisions about diagno-sis and treatment based on the speciﬁc caseofthe patient.The examples differ fromother public sector activities that are discre-tionary but not transaction-intensive,suchas setting monetary policy or regulating amonopoly—or those that are transaction-07_WDR_Ch03.qxd  8/14/03  7:59 AM  Page 52(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

The framework for service provision53intensive but not discretionary,such as tak-ing in bank deposits or controlling trafﬁc.Services may be transaction-intensiveand discretionary,but some stages in ser-vice provision may be less transaction-intensive or discretionary (table 3.2).Evenin the health sector,services span the range.For immunization,the appropriate action isnearly the same for each individual ofagiven age (easily observed).The problemsin implementation,while formidable,areprimarily logistical.But for curative ser-vices,providers have to respond to com-plaints from individuals and exercise discre-tion in choosing treatment.Services that are both discretionary andtransaction-intensive present challenges forany relationship ofaccountability—becauseit is difﬁcult to know whether the providerhas performed well.Administrative andbureaucratic controls that work well forlogistical tasks are overwhelmed when theyattempt to monitor the millions ofdailyinteractions ofteachers with students,policemen with citizens,case workers withclients,medical practitioners with patients.Rigid,scripted rules would not give enoughlatitude.Multiple principals,multiple tasks.Publicservants serve many masters.Power andwater providers are under pressure fromdifferent segments ofthe market to cross-subsidize them—from producers to buyspeciﬁc types ofequipment,from peoplewho want more extensive connections,andfrom others who want more reliable,con-tinuous operation.The day-to-day pressureoflocal demand for health care can com-promise efforts in disease prevention andother public health activities that are notdemand-driven.164Personnel in health clinics are supposedto provide immunizations,curative care topeople who come to them,health educationand other preventive measures to everyone(whether they come in on their own ornot),keep statistics,attend training sessionsand meetings,and do inspections ofwaterand food.Police ofﬁcers have to deal witheveryone from lost children to dangerouscriminals.This diffusion blunts the preci-sion ofincentives (box 3.3).AttributabilityThe third problem in monitoring serviceprovision is that it is often very difﬁcult toattribute outcomes to the actions oftheservice providers because there are impor-tant “co-producers.”As chapter 1 empha-sized,health and education outcomesaremainly produced in households and com-munities.The health ofindividualsdepends on their decisions about nutrition(constrained by income),activity levels,personal hygiene practices (often con-strained by the availability ofwater)—andon community factors that determineexposure to pathogens.Even ifpeople seektreatment when they are sick,the effective-ness oftreatment depends in part onprovider quality and individual compliancewith the recommended therapies.The difﬁculty in monitoring discre-tionary,transaction-intensive services is notunique to the public sector—it is inherent inservices.Patients generally know how theyfeel.Studies ofprivate practitioners in Indiacommonly ﬁnd practices that lead to short-run improvement in symptoms (such assteroid shots) but are not medically effec-tive—or are even counterindicated.165Patients feel better,and this attracts repeatcustomers.But it does not create realaccountability,because simply being pleasedwith the service is not sufﬁcient information.Table 3.2Examples of discretionary and transaction-intensive servicesSectorDiscretionary, not Discretionary and Transaction-intensive,transaction-intensivetransaction-intensivenot discretionaryCommercial bankingSetting deposit ratesApproving loans to Taking in depositssmall businessesSocial protectionSetting eligibility “Case worker” Issuing checks to the criteriadeterminationseligiblePolicingLawmaking deﬁning Handling individual criminal behaviorconﬂict situationsDirecting trafﬁcEducationCurriculumClassroom teachingProviding school lunchesHealthPublic information Curative careVaccinationscampaignsIrrigationLocation of main Allocation of water Providing standpipes canalsﬂows“in every village”Central banksMonetary policyBanking regulationClearing houseAgricultural extensionResearch prioritiesCommunication with farmers07_WDR_Ch03.qxd  8/14/03  7:59 AM  Page 53(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

54WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Many outcomes,even when observable tothe patient and the doctor,are not “con-tractable”in the sense ofbeing able to provecompliance to a judge or other mediator ifadispute arises.Successes and failures of thepublic sector and the marketDiscussions ofpublic action often juxta-pose two polar extremes for the institu-tional arrangements for services:traditionalpublic production,in which all publicaction and resources are channeled througha public sector organization with civil ser-vants;and market production,in which thepublic sector takes a minimal role (but atleast establishes the basic conditions for amarket,such as enforcing contracts).This Report seeks to help the public sec-tor meet its responsibility for health andeducation outcomes.The public sector candischarge its responsibility by engaging in avariety ofinstitutional arrangements forservice provision,including direct produc-tion,contracting out,demand-side trans-fers,and so on.Before getting to them,ithelps to illustrate the weaknesses ofthe twopolar positions,using the ﬁve failures ofservices detailed in chapter 1—inaccessibil-ity,dysfunctionality,low technical quality,lack ofclient responsiveness,and stagnantproductivity.Public productionTwo ofthe most powerful innovations ofthelong 20th century (1870–1989) are themutually reinforcing ideas ofthe nation-state,with extensive powers and responsibili-ties,and the civil service bureaucracy.Together they produced the consensus thatgovernments have responsibilities for thewelfare oftheir citizens,and that the mosteffective way to fulﬁll these responsibilities isthrough the direct production ofservicesthrough a public sector organization withcivil service employees.The contested ide-ologies ofthe 20th century—communism,capitalism,democracy—pale before thepower ofthe twin ideas ofa nation-state anda public sector bureaucracy.These ideologieswere merely notions ofthe uses for thenation-state and its bureaucracy.As just one example,schooling in themiddle ofthe 19th century was almostPolice are delegated substantial powers—tocompel and,if necessary,to use violence.Whatobjectives should they pursue,and how couldthey be held accountable? •“Client satisfaction”is not what should drivepolice,for who is the “client”? Certainly notthe criminals,and certainly not just the vic-tims:there are many objectives—creating asafe environment,apprehending criminals,respecting individual rights and dignity.•Police cannot simply follow a script—theyhave to exercise discretion.If they went “bythe book”and enforced every infraction,moreimportant activities would grind to a halt.•They rely on many co-producers.Without thecooperation of citizens in abiding by the law,reporting violations,helping in investigations,the job of the police would be impossible.And many determinants of crime are notunder the control of the police,such as eco-nomic trends,social changes,anddemographic shifts.The recipe for inefﬁciency,abuse,and cor-ruption:simply turn individuals loose withvague objectives,lots of discretion,little perfor-mance information,few mechanisms of enforce-ability (either internal or external),and the pub-lic authority to compel (and often too littlebudget).A frequent complaint of poor people isthe abuse they suffer from the police.As oneKenyan put it recently “You cannot carry muchmoney with you these days.There are too manypolicemen.”There are no easy answers.“Privatizing”policing functions would face the same prob-lems:what would be the measure of output todetermine what the ﬁrm should be paid? Crimerates? They are not under police control (andthey would deter reporting).Arrests? That wouldencourage false arrests to meet production quo-tas.Surveys of citizen perceptions of safety?These risk overzealous police violating therights of the socially disadvantaged to pleasethe minority.Penalties for abuse of authority?Police might then do too little.Recent experience in several cities,notablyNew York,shows that better measurement ofseveral important outputs is possible.Crimerates were measured by neighborhood,reported regularly as a management tool,usedto allocate police time and visibility.Crime ratesfell signiﬁcantly.This approach can backﬁre,though,if the desired outcomes are not wellspeciﬁed.Studies of police behavior in Londonand Los Angeles showed that the monitoredand numerically measured activities (crime ratesand citizen complaints) improved markedly.Butother measures—community activities andcrime rates,particularly for homicide—gotworse.So there is no general “optimal”solution.Butthere are solutions to particular cases,better orworse in their adaptation to local circumstance.Creating more functional police servicesrequires creating multiple institutional channelsof accountability—political (police are not sim-ply an instrument of oppression),compacts(policymakers can hold police in check),man-agement (organizational strategies caninculcate dedication,loyalty,restraint),and clientpower (citizens have mechanisms to inﬂuencepolice behavior directly,a free press).Sources:Moore and others (2002);The Economist(2002);Burguess,Propper,and Wilson (2002);Pren-dergast (2001).BOX 3.3Creating conditions ofaccountability: the police07_WDR_Ch03.qxd  8/14/03  8:00 AM  Page 54(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

The framework for service provision55exclusively in private hands (largely reli-gious).Today the direct production ofschooling by the public sector—with thenation-state the dominant service provider,involved in every facet ofschooling frombuilding schools,to determining the cur-riculum and texts,to training,hiring,assigning,and controlling teachers as civilservants—has completely triumphed as anidea,so completely that people forget it wasever contested (box 3.4).Public bureaucracies are truly a blessingofmodern life.All countries with high liv-ing standards have teachers who teach,police ofﬁcers who police,judges whojudge,public works that work,armies thatrespond to external threats.Yes,bureaucra-cies might be frustrating,slow,inefﬁcient,and resistant to innovation.But the fantasyof“getting rid ofthe bureaucracy”wouldturn into a nightmare.No country hasdeveloped without state reliance on aneffective public bureaucracy to dischargethe key functions ofthe state—though notalways through direct production.So whydo some bureaucracies perform badly andothers well? And how do countries get frombadly to well? The analytical framework ofthe rela-tionships ofaccountability provides a wayofdiagnosing not just the symptoms ofpoor performance (inefﬁciency,corruption,poor performance) and not just the proxi-mate determinants ofthese symptoms (lackofresources,low motivation,poor training,and little capability).It also provides a wayofanalyzing the deep institutional causes ofpoor performance.In public sector production the directlink ofclient power is frequently missing,sosuccessful public production relies on“long-route”accountability.What does thattake? The policymaker must care about out-comes,including those for poor people.That concern needs to be transmitted effec-tively to the public agencies that receivepublic resources to provide the services.And the public agencies must hire techni-cally qualiﬁed providers motivated to pro-vide the services.When all this happens,asit often does in developed countries,publicservice production is reliable and effective.Indeed,some ofthe most admired andeffective organizations in the world arepublic agencies.When the long route is not working,theframework provides a way to understandthe failures by identifying which relation-ship ofaccountability was the weak link—and within the relationship ofaccountabil-ity,which was the missing dimension.•There are voice failures,when the state(controlled by politicians and policy-makers) simply does not care about pro-viding services—or does so in a strictlyvenal or clientelist manner.The clearestsign ofthis:when too little budget isdevoted to services for poor people,andwhen that budget is allocated to meetpolitical interests.Samuel Hays,in his study of the evolution ofconservation policy in the United States inthe early 20th century,expresses eloquentlythe political and social tensions in the shiftto modern bureaucracies:“The dynamics of conservation,with itstension between the centralizing tenden-cies of system and expertise on the onehand and decentralization and localism onthe other,is typical of a whole series of simi-lar tensions between centralization anddecentralization within modern ...society.The poles of the continuum along whichthese forces were arrayed can be describedbrieﬂy.On the one hand many facets ofhuman life were bound up with relativelysmall scale activities focusing on the dailyroutines of job,home,religion,school andrecreation in which a pattern of inter-per-sonal relationships developed within rela-tively small geographical areas....On theother hand,however,modern forms ofsocial organization gave rise to larger pat-terns of human interaction,to ties of occu-pation and profession over wide areas,tocorporate systems which extended into afar ﬂung network,to impersonal—statisti-cal—forms of understanding,to reliance onexpertise and to centralized manipulationand control....To many people the externalcharacteristics of this process—efﬁciency,expertise,order—constituted the spirit of“progressivism.”These new forms of organi-zation tended to shift the location of deci-sion-making away from the grass-roots,thesmaller contexts of life,to the largernetworks of human interaction.This upwardshift can be seen in many speciﬁc types...:the growth of city-wide systems of execu-tive action and representation in bothschool and general government to super-sede the previous focus on ward represen-tation and action;the similar upward shift inthe management of schools and roads fromthe township to the county and state.“Examination of the evolution of con-servation political struggles,therefore,brings into sharp focus the two competingpolitical systems....On the one hand thespirit of science and technology,of rationalsystem and organization,shifted the loca-tion of decision-making continually upwardso as to narrow the range of inﬂuencesimpinging upon it and to guide that deci-sion-making process with large,cosmopoli-tan considerations,technical expertness,and the objectives of those involved in thewider networks of modern society.On theother however,were a host of politicalimpulses,often separate and conﬂicting,diffuse,and struggling against each otherwith in the larger political order.Their politi-cal activities sustained a more open politi-cal system ...in which complex and esotericfacts possessed by only a few were not per-mitted to dominate the process of decision-making,and the satisfaction of grassrootsimpulses remained a constantly viable ele-ment of the political order.”Source:Hays (1959).BOX 3.4The “Progressive Era”: creation ofmodernbureaucracy07_WDR_Ch03.qxd  8/14/03  8:00 AM  Page 55(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

56WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004•There are compact failures,in which thestate fails to communicate clear responsi-bilities for outputs or outcomes to thepublic organization and fails to enforceany responsibility.Compact failures arealso associated with management failures,in which the public sector organizationfails to motivate its frontline workers.All this is embedded in a system in whichthe feedback loop from client satisfaction toboth frontline and organizational providersis cut.Voice.A common cause ofthe failure ofpublic service production is the apathy ofthestate.Governments may care about someservices for ideological reasons.But whenvoice is weak (or divided or conﬂicted) andthe state is freed from the constraint ofsatis-fying its citizens,there are many possibilitiesfor failure.The state delivers little or nothingto its poor and socially disadvantaged citi-zens,reserving its few services for the elite,including favored members ofthe govern-ment.In these circumstances alternativestrategies ofpublic sector management willbe powerless to create better services.Many analysts and advocates point outthat resources devoted to services are inade-quate.But those budget allocations are theresult ofpolitical decisions:about the leveloftaxation and mobilization ofresources;about the allocations ofbudgets acrossactivities;about the design ofprograms thatdetermine who beneﬁts;about the alloca-tion ofexpenditures across inputs (howmuch for wages and other things).Ifresources are inadequate,ifthey are ineffec-tively applied to service provision for poorpeople,it is often because poor people’svoices are not being heard.Nor is much information generated thatwould allow citizens to judge how effec-tively their government is providing ser-vices.Since information is power,it is oftenclosely guarded—or never created in theﬁrst place.Politicians seldom create infor-mation about outputs and outcomes.Indi-viduals know about the quality ofthe ser-vices they confront,but they have a difﬁculttime translating that knowledge into publicpower.Indeed,politicians may use theselective provision ofservices as a clientelis-tic tool to “buy”political support—or,worse,to enforce state control ofcitizenswhile weakening their voice (box 3.5).Compacts.The complex compact rela-tionship fails in many ways.In failed or fail-ing states (such as those the World Bankcalls Low-Income Countries Under Stress,or LICUS) there is no compact because thestate’s control is very shallow.This happenswhen countries are embroiled in long civilwars (Afghanistan,El Salvador,Somalia,Sudan) or large parts ofthe country arebeyond the reach ofgovernment (Democ-ratic Republic ofCongo).Even in working states the compact rela-tionship between the state and publicprovider agencies is often extremely weak.The delegation and speciﬁcation ofgoalsare often vague or nonexistent,and thererarely are clear responsibilities for outputsor links to outcomes.Budget allocationsand stafﬁng for agencies are determinedwithout any direct relationship to past per-formance or clearly speciﬁed objectives.This means that providers are often under-funded relative to announced rhetorical,and unrealistic,targets.Without clear delegation ofresponsibili-ties and identiﬁed objectives,there is no wayofgenerating the relevant performance infor-mation for managing or assessing the organi-zation.Without clear information on organi-zational objectives and progress,it becomesAn anthropological study of urban Cairodetailing the “Avenues of Participation”—the ways residents coped with the demandsof the state,and sought its favors—revealeda pattern common in many countries.First,there is a huge gap between the formal andinformal realities.As a manager of a family-owned shoe factory explained:We are caught in the middle of two totally sep-arate systems that do not communicate witheach other.One of them is the legal [formal]system.The other one is what we call the tradi-tional system,which is much stronger than thelaw.That is what really controls us.(p.205).That gap means that,in approachingthe state,individuals must rely on informalconnections,personal relationships,andoutright bribes to ofﬁcials.There also wereexplicit “patron-client”relationships:In a particular relationship I was able toobserve closely that the ties between“patron”and the supposed “client”were veryclose and reciprocal.The “client”receivedloans from the politician,gifts of food andclothing for her family,publicly subsidizedapartments,employment for her and herfamily,assistance with bureaucratic problems,and a great deal of information....At electiontime the client returned this service by orga-nizing the election campaign and marshalinglocal political support in the district.Source:Singerman (1995).BOX 3.5Seeking services in the Arab Republic ofEgypt07_WDR_Ch03.qxd  8/14/03  8:01 AM  Page 56(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

The framework for service provision57impossible to create enforceability.This alsodiscourages innovation and responsiveness.There may be many isolated successes in ser-vice provision and striking examples ofpub-lic servants succeeding even against the odds.But nothing in the system encourages thereplication ofsuccessful innovations.This is not to deny the enormous beneﬁtsthat public provision has attained.But thosebeneﬁts have often been in areas in which thecompact relationship is relatively easybecause the targets are numerical and provi-sion is logistical.Strong states,even the polit-ically repressive,have been successful in pro-viding services.Socialist states,such as China,have had great success in the social sectors.But moving beyond the impressive logisticalaccomplishment and improving quality hasproved much more difﬁcult.Even weak statescan launch and sustain vertical programs oflogistical delivery—expanding childhoodvaccinations in very troubled situations is aclassic example.But going from services pro-vided in “campaign”mode to more discre-tionary and quality-sensitive services hasproved much more difﬁcult.Management.Failures ofmanagement arealso common in public production ofser-vices.Frontline workers rarely receive(explicit or implicit) incentives for successfulservice delivery.There are no stipulations forservice quality and quantity,no measurementofeffectiveness or productivity,few rewardsor penalties.The provider organization mon-itors only inputs and compliance withprocesses and procedures.Even so,somestates have provided some services underthese conditions,but the services remain lim-ited,low in quality,high in cost.The problems are deep.Quick ﬁxes thatseem too good to be true probably are.Oneresponse to the corruption,absenteeism,andunderperformance ofproviders is strictermonitoring.But ifthe objectives are not wellknown and ifit is difﬁcult to monitor behav-ior,it is difﬁcult to assess performance on thebasis ofreal,relevant output measures.So“accountability”is instead created by strictrules,intended to prevent abuse,andattempts to monitor compliance with somecrudely measured proxies (attendance) or toreduce the activity to scripts that must be fol-lowed strictly.That approach can succeed fortruly logistical tasks,but it can also be coun-terproductive.By constraining the profes-sional autonomy offrontline providers,itmay frustrate self-motivated frontline work-ers,driving them away and undermining thedevelopment ofstrong providers.The goal is to have providers with morecapability,more autonomy,and more discre-tion in providing quality services.But moreautonomy requires more performance-basedaccountability.That is intrinsically difﬁcult tocreate because ofthe multiple (often unob-servable) objectives ofpublic action,thedemands ofmonitoring discretionary andtransaction-intensive services,and the difﬁ-culty ofattributing outputs or outcomes toactions by providers.Take schooling (chapter 7):good teachingis a complex endeavor.The quality ofateacher cannot be assessed strictly on thebasis ofstudent scores on a standardizedexamination.Why not? Schooling has manyother objectives.It is difﬁcult to isolate thevalue added.And simply paying and promot-ing all teachers the same does not motivategood teaching—it can even lower moraleamong motivated teachers.Perhaps good teaching can be assessedsubjectively by another trained educator—ahead teacher or school principal.But this cre-ates the temptation to play favorites or,worse,to extract payments from teachers for goodassessments.So the autonomy ofschool headsmust be limited by accountability,to motivatethem to reward good teachers.There must bean assessment standard for school heads.Butall the problems ofassessing good teachingalso apply to good school heads.Indeed,thatis how dysfunctional bureaucracies cascadeinto a morass ofcorruption,as upward pay-ments from those at lower levels buy goodassignments or ratings from superiors.The marketThe “market,”as an idealized set ofrelation-ships ofaccountability,relies more or lessexclusively on client power—and only onthat part ofclient power that is based onchoice,backed by purchasing power.Cus-tomerpower is the main relationship ofaccountability.The market has severalstrengths in the provision ofservices—but07_WDR_Ch03.qxd  8/14/03  8:01 AM  Page 57(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

58WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004also many weaknesses.One strength is thatcustomers will buy where they perceive thegreatest satisfaction—so organizations haveincentives to be responsive to clients.Anotherstrength is that since the organizations areautonomous,they can manage their frontlineproviders as they wish.Yet another is thatwith a variety oforganizations providing ser-vices,each can be ﬂexible with innovationand each has the incentive to adopt successfulinnovations (or else lose resources).Marketsproduce innovations and scale them up bytrial and error followed by replication andimitation—for organizational innovation aswell as product innovation.But for the services in this Report,themarket has three weaknesses.•It responds exclusively to customer power,so there are no pressures for equity (muchless equality) in the allocation ofservices(though it is not obvious that political sys-tems lacking strong citizen voice have anygreater pressures for equity).•It will not,in general,satisfy collectiveobjectives (simply adding up individualobjectives).For instance,ifone person’suse ofadequate sanitation affects thosewho live nearby,individuals may under-invest in sanitation.•It can be effective in having customerpower discipline providers only whenthe customer has the relevant informa-tion about provider performance.Inambulatory curative care it is easy forcustomers to know their waiting timeand to know how they were treated.Butit is very difﬁcult for them to knowwhether the medical treatment theyreceived was effective and appropriatefor their condition.From principles to instrumentsThis Report uses the framework ofactors andtheir relationships ofaccountability andpower to understand the successes and fail-ures ofcentralized public service produc-tion—and to evaluate reforms and new pro-posed institutional arrangements for serviceprovision.Given the failures and limitationsofthe traditional model ofservice provi-sion—the long route—greater reliance willinevitably be placed on more direct clientinﬂuence—the short route.In some extremecases where the long route breaks down sud-denly,as in the aftermath ofthe breakup ofthe Soviet Union,reliance on the short routearises by default (box 3.6).But increasedreliance can be deliberate,forming the basisofa wide variety ofinstitutional reforms,each with strong advocates.In education people believe that schoolswill improve with more use ofchoicethrough vouchers,greater community con-trol,greater school autonomy,having moreinformation about budget ﬂows and moreaggressive testing and school-based account-ability.In health people believe that care willimprove through greater demand-sideﬁnancing (and less public production),moreuse ofvertical programs for speciﬁc diseases,and community control ofhealth centers.Others emphasize solutions that cut acrosssectors:community-driven development,participatory budgeting,power to local gov-ernments,“new public management,”andcivil service reform.All these proposals aim to improve ser-vices by changing the relationships ofaccountability.All recognize that,thoughthere are many proximate causes offailure,the deep causes lie with inadequate institu-tional arrangements.Iffrontline workers(civil servants) in the existing organizationsofpublic production are frequently absent,have little regard for clients who are poor,andlack the technical knowledge to perform theirservices well,this inadequate organizationalcapacity is the proximate cause ofpoor ser-vices.Too frequently those seeking improve-ment have focused only on internal organiza-tional reforms—focusing on management ofthe frontline workers.Iforganizational fail-ures are the result ofdeeper weaknesses ininstitutional arrangements (weak politicalcommitment,unclear objectives,no enforce-ability),direct attacks on the proximatedeterminants (more money,better training,more internal information) will fail.Different systems can underpin success.For example,countries have very differentinstitutional arrangements in corporateﬁnance.Crudely put,in Japan ﬁrms ownbanks,in Germany banks own ﬁrms,and inthe United States banks and ﬁrms are sepa-rated.All three countries have very high levels07_WDR_Ch03.qxd  8/14/03  8:02 AM  Page 58(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

The framework for service provision59ofincome—so it cannot be that any oftheseinstitutional arrangements is incompatiblewith economic development.At the sametime,countries with ﬁnancial arrangementsvery similar to one ofthese three have failedto develop.With many proposed solutions,does anything go? No.Solutions need to con-form to certain principles,but the principlesneed to be implemented in ways that areappropriate to the time,place,and service.American Indians as a group are the poor-est minority in America.Some tribes,such asthe Pine Ridge Oglala Sioux,have severe eco-nomic problems (unemployment in 1989was 61 percent).But others,such as the WhiteMountain Apache,do badly,but much better(unemployment was only 11 percent).Aspart ofattempts to control them,their gov-ernments were imposed on them by the U.S.federal government and varied little acrosstribes.The imposed constitutions were rea-sonably well-adapted to Apache social andcultural norms,providing a reasonable ﬁtbetween formal and informal structures ofpower.In contrast,the formal constitutionwas at odds with Sioux norms and led to con-tinuing discord between formal and informalmodes ofexercising power,precluding theemergence ofeffective institutions.166Many African scholars argue that the rootsofthe problems in Africa today lie in thelegacy ofcolonialism.Nation-state bound-aries followed colonial power rather thanAfrican realities.The struggle over how toadapt or transform the transplanted institu-tions continues to inﬂuence debates today.The upheavals that accompanied the breakup ofthe Soviet Union had serious consequences forthe health sectors of the resulting states.In theSoviet era,the health system was run,virtually inits entirety,by the central government.It had itsproblems.It was rigidly ﬁnanced on the basis ofinputs rather than outputs.It was extremelybiased toward hospital and specialist care.Itinefﬁciently relied upon high-cost proceduresand long hospital stays relative to other indus-trial countries.And it was not at all orientedtoward clients.But it worked.Services were freeto all,and particularly in the resource-poorrepublics,many in Central Asia,it contributed tolevels of health status—low mortality rates andhigh life expectancy—much higher than inother countries at similar levels of income.It worked because the two legs of the “longroute”functioned well enough.A commitment touniversal coverage of health and other social ser-vices deriving from socialist principles substitutedfor “voice”in the form of free political expression.“Compacts,”or more speciﬁcally direct manage-ment,were enforced through means of the sub-stantial control government had over state-employed providers.There may have been somesupport for this arrangement from the “shortroute”due to monitoring by local party leaders,but this was distinctly secondary given the stronghierarchic management capacity of government.Then the compact collapsed.Accountabilityto policymakers could no longer be enforced—there was no longer funding or control from thecenter.Within the republics,dramatic declines inincome led to similarly dramatic declines inpublic funding for the sector.Also,since almosteverything had been produced by the state,there was no history of setting priorities accord-ing to the degree of public responsibility eachactivity warranted,so the budgets for evenhigh-priority public goods were not protected.The resurgence of some vaccine-preventablediseases as well as the growth of infectious dis-eases (HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis especially)attest to this.The “compact”leg of the longroute was gone;political structures for the“voice”leg were (and in some cases still are) yetto develop,leaving a vacuum.All of the Commonwealth of IndependentStates (CIS) countries are struggling to replacethe former system while suffering from the twinliabilities of declines in income and the legacyof an unsustainable degree of hospital—andstafﬁng—intensity inherited from the formerregime.The pace and deliberateness of reformstrategies have varied substantially among theCIS countries.In most there has been a markedincrease in the private sector and in fees—bothinformal and institutionalized (particularly inGeorgia and the Kyrgyz Republic)—in publicfacilities.Both tendencies have meant that pri-vate ﬁnancing has become a large part of thehealth market—averaging around 40 percentbut ranging from under 20 percent inUzbekistan to over 90 percent in Georgia.Uzbekistan’s retention of a large public sectorreﬂects a more robust economy.Having naturalresources to sell led to a fall in income of only 5percent between 1990 and 2000 in contrast tomore typical declines of 30 percent in Armenia,45 percent in Azerbaijan,or the more extremecases of 65 percent in Moldova and 70 percentin Georgia.Even when there was no deliberate policy ofprivatization—the sale of public facilities to arecognized private provider—growth in the pri-vate sector was simply a matter of the market(the short route) taking over when the statebecame incapable of ensuring services.Similarly,the oversupply of hospital beds hasfallen by an average of 40 percent from its 1990level.Again,whether this was due to a deliber-ate policy (a 55 percent fall in Uzbekistan—almost all in public hands) or a simple necessitybecause of austerity and closures after privatiza-tion (the same 55 percent fall in Georgia) is anopen question.Reforms under consideration in the CIScountries generally involve such client-centeredmechanisms as insurance (a conditionalvoucher) and capitation schemes,both of whichallow payments to follow patients.Progress isslow,however.Institutions take time to developand the information collection systems neces-sary for getting good results from insuranceprograms are still lacking.The starting point for the CIS countries isvery different from that of developing countriesin general—too much infrastructure andresources rather than too little.However,inmany ways the solutions will be similar.Substan-tially more reliance on the “short route”ofaccountability is likely,with government being amonitor and enforcer of the rules of the gameregardless of who ultimately becomes the directprovider.Source:Maria

60WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Here is how Mamdani opens his study,Citi-zen and Subject:Discussions on Africa’s present predicamentrevolve around two clear tendencies:mod-ernist and communitarian.For modernists,the problem is that civil society is an embry-onic and marginal construct;for communi-tarians,it is that the real ﬂesh-and-bloodcommunities that constitute Africa are mar-ginalized from public life as so many“tribes.”The liberal solution is to locate pol-itics in civil society,and the Africanist solu-tion is to put Africa’s age-old communitiesat the center ofAfrican politics.One sidecalls for a regime that will champion rights,and the other stands in defense ofculture.The impasse in Africa is not only at the levelofpractical politics.It is also a paralysis ofperspective.167Reforming institutions toimprove services for poorpeople will be difﬁcultBecause institutional reforms change powerrelationships among actors,they are politi-cal reforms.But politics generally does notfavor reforms that improve services forpoor people.Such reforms require upset-ting entrenched interests,which have theadvantage ofinertia,history,organizationalcapability,and knowing exactly what is atstake.Policymakers and providers are gen-erally more organized,informed,and inﬂu-ential than citizens,particularly poor citi-zens.But reform is possible,even againstthese odds.•Pro-poor coalitions for better servicesincrease the odds for success.•Change agents and reform championscan shape the agenda and follow throughon implementation.•When the prospects for successful institu-tional reform are not propitious,strategicincrementalism may be all that is possible.But pursuing it has the danger ofbeingmerely incremental incrementalism.Pro-poor coalitions In most instances making services work forpoor people means making services work foreverybody—while ensuring that poor peoplehave access to those services.Required is acoalition that includes poor people and signif-icant elements ofthe non-poor.There isunlikely to be progress without substantial“middle-class buy-in”to proposed reforms.Inthe words ofWilbur Cohen,U.S.Secretary ofHealth,Education,and Welfare under Presi-dent Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s:“Programsfor poor people are poor programs.”168De Soto’s study ofrights to real estate inurban areas emphasizes that not only arepoor people outside the beneﬁts ofhavingsecure title and claim to their property,but soare nearly all ofthe middle class.His study ofthe historical evolution ofproperty rights inthe United States strongly suggested that theresponse to popular political pressure—nottop-down technocratic design—was the keyto a broad-based system ofproperty rights.169Since poor people are excluded from manyservices,such as primary education or safewater,improvements in the system are likelyto disproportionately beneﬁt poor people.But broad coalitions are not always sufﬁ-cient because some services need to be tai-lored to destitute and disadvantaged groups(as in situations ofethnic or gender exclu-sion).A common obstacle in the access toservices is that the socially disadvantaged areexcluded—as a matter ofpolicy,or becausethey feel excluded due to their treatment byproviders,or due to actions ofmore powerfulsocial groups within the community itself.The politics ofservices for disadvantagedgroups are even more difﬁcult,because coali-tions made up exclusively ofthe powerless areoften powerless.Change agents—reform championsEpisodes ofreform depend on reformchampions,the entrepreneurs ofpublic sec-tor reform.They emerge from varioussources.Politicians can often pursue serviceimprovements even when the conditionsare not propitious.They must act to createand sustain pressures for reform.Profes-sional associations are often both the sourceofpressure for,and resistance to,majorinnovations.Dissatisﬁed with the progressin their ﬁeld—education,policing,publichealth,sanitation—professionals emerge aschampions for reform,putting pressures onpoliticians and policymakers for reform.For instance,the campaign ofPublic Ser-vices International for “Quality Public Ser-07_WDR_Ch03.qxd  8/14/03  8:03 AM  Page 60(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

The framework for service provision61vices”balances the unions’role in protect-ing the rights ofworkers with support forinnovation in public service delivery.170Linking the efforts ofthese “insiders”and“technocrats”to broader coalitions ofcitizensis often a key element ofsuccess.Strategic incrementalism Sweeping or fundamental reform ofinstitu-tions is rare.It requires the right conditions.Arecent study emphasizes how long the devel-opment ofpolitical institutions in the now-developed countries took (table 3.3).Most“modern”institutions of“modern”politicaland economic governance that are recom-mended today emerged late in the now-developed countries (at much higher levelsofincome than developing countries today).And they spread slowly across countries.Inthe United States universal white male suf-frage was not achieved until 1870,female suf-frage did not come until 1925,and true uni-versal suffrage did not come until (at least)1965.Switzerland did not adopt female suf-frage until 1971.Canada’s widely discussed“single-payer”style ofhealth insurance didnot emerge until the 1970s.Institutionalreform that changes the landscape usuallymoves at a glacial pace—but glaciers do moveand carve out new landscapes when they do.The improvement ofservices,alwayspressing,cannot wait for the right conditions.Some arrangements,such as enclaveapproaches to delivering services to poorpeople,may not be sustainable in the longrun,even ifthey improve outcomes in theshort run.Often driven by donors,theseactions can undermine national relationshipsofaccountability (chapter 11).Sometimesthe desirable arrangement is to strengthenthe weakest link.Ifthe policymaker-providerlink is weak,contracting out services—suchas Cambodia’s use ofnongovernmental orga-nizations for primary health services—maybe the preferred arrangement.But incremen-tal activities—pragmatic improvisation tomake services work even in a weak institu-tional environment—should be used to cre-ate more favorable conditions for reform inthe longer run.Temporary work-aroundscannot and should not substitute for creatingthe conditions for reform.Table 3.3Modern institutions took a long time to developInstitution/reformFirst Majority (of now LastUnited KingdomUnited Statesdeveloped countries)Universal male suffrage1848 (France)19071907 (Japan)19181870–1965Universal suffrage1907 (New Zealand)19461971 (Switzerland)19281928–1965Health insurance (the basis for what is now universal)188319111911Still no universal coverage State pensions1889 (Germany)19091946 (Switzerland)19081946Source: Chang (2002).07_WDR_Ch03.qxd  8/14/03  8:03 AM  Page 61(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Did emerging democracy make the difference?The argument that free elections con-tributed to the success in Uganda is but-tressed by three observations.Educationwas a salient issue for Ugandan voters.Theelectorate had access to information aboutgovernment performance in this area.Andthe success ofuniversal primary educationcontributed to President Museveni’s con-tinued popularity.171For candidates to believe that they willbe judged on whether education promisesare fulﬁlled,education must be importantfor voters.Museveni’s 1996 commitment touniversal primary education would havebeen expected to draw national support,while Paul Ssemogerere’s positions on thenorthern rebellion,Buganda autonomy,and reintroduction ofpolitical partieswould have been expected to generateregional support.Museveni’s victory did not depend on asingle regional base ofsupport.He receivedmore than 90 percent ofthe vote inUganda’s western region,74 percent ofthevotes in Paul Ssemogerere’s home region(central),and 72 percent ofthe vote in theeastern region.President Yoweri Museveni’s decisionin 1996 to make universal primaryeducation an issue in the presidentialelection campaign broke with his earlierposition.He had previously emphasized thatbuilding roads and infrastructure wouldprovide access to markets to enable people togenerate income that would pay for school-ing.But in a radio address in March,hepromised to give access to free primary edu-cation to four children per family,up to twoboys and two girls,and all orphans.Although free primary education wasonly one part ofMuseveni’s manifesto,itsoon became clear that the promise hadstruck a chord with the electorate.Financeministry ofﬁcials recall that several ofMusev-eni’s advisors repeatedly sent them messagesafter campaign meetings,emphasizing howthe promise had resonated with the public.The May 1996 election was Uganda’sﬁrst presidential election since the militarytakeover in 1986.Though the elections didnot involve ofﬁcial multiparty competition,President Museveni faced a credible chal-lenger,Paul Ssemogerere,the leader oftheDemocratic party.Ssemogerere promisedto restore multiparty politics,negotiatewith the rebel movement in northernUganda,and grant greater autonomy to theBuganda region,once an independent king-dom.These stances positioned him for sub-stantial regional support in northern andcentral Uganda.He also declared that hewould match Museveni’s promise to pro-vide free primary education.In December 1996,soon after a landslidevictory,President Museveni announced theabolition ofschool fees.Since then there hasbeen a sustained shift in Ugandan publicexpenditures in favor ofeducation,espe-cially for primary schools.Spending on edu-cation has risen as a share ofgovernmentexpenditures from an average of20 percentin the three ﬁscal years preceding the elec-tion to an average of26 percent in the threeyears following.Total enrollment in primaryschools skyrocketed (ﬁgure 1).In the elections in Malawi in 1994 thewinning presidential candidate also madeuniversal primary education part ofhismanifesto,but voting was much morepolarized along regional lines than it was inUganda.The winner would thus have hadan incentive to continue to cultivate aregional base ofsupport,rather than todeliver on a national issue like education.Ugandan voters had access to varioussources ofinformation about the educationinitiative that enabled them to evaluate howthe government had made good on its 1996election promises.Major national dailies,such as The Monitor and The New Vision,continued to give prominent coverage touniversal primary education issues.Data collected by the Afrobarometerproject show that Ugandans believe thatPresident Museveni has performed veryeffectively,and in rating government per-formance they are most satisﬁed with edu-cation policy.During the June 2000 survey,93 percent ofrespondents reported thatthey were either somewhat satisﬁed or verysatisﬁed with Museveni’s overall perfor-mance.Eighty-seven percent ofUgandansreported that their government was han-dling education issues well,while the aver-age across the 12 African countries was 59percent.Macroeconomic stability and budgetary institutionsDemocratic politics may have given theUgandan government an incentive to deliveron its education promise of1996.But suc-cess in reorienting public expenditurestoward primary education has alsodepended on stabilizing the macroeconomicenvironment and developing budgetaryinstitutions.172Stable macroeconomic con-ditions have undoubtedly made it easier toforecast revenues and expenditures.Undermore unstable macroeconomic conditions,African governments like Malawi have foundit difﬁcult to maintain a sustained commit-ment to increasing education expenditures.Universal primary education—what does it take?Primary school enrollment in Uganda rose from 3.6 million students to 6.9 million between 1996 and 2001.Whataccounts for such a drastic increase in such a short time: Political will?

Spotlight on Uganda63audited or monitored,and most schoolsand parents had little or no informationabout their entitlements to the grants.Mostfunds went to purposes unrelated to educa-tion or for private gain,as indicated bynumerous newspaper articles about indict-ments ofdistrict education ofﬁcers after thesurvey ﬁndings went public.To respond to the problem,the centralgovernment began publishing data onmonthly transfers ofgrants to districts innewspapers and to broadcast them on theradio.It required primary schools and dis-trict administrations to post notices on allinﬂows offunds.This promoted account-ability by giving schools and parents accessto information needed to understand andmonitor the grant program.An evaluation ofthe information cam-paign reveals a large improvement.Schoolsare still not receiving the entire grant (andthere are delays).But the capture by inter-ests along the way has been reduced from80 percent in 1995 to 20 percent in 2001(ﬁgure 2).A before-and-after assessmentcomparing outcomes for the same schoolsin 1995 and 2001—and taking into accountschool-speciﬁc factors,household income,teachers’education,school size,and super-vision—suggests that the information cam-paign explains two-thirds ofthe massiveimprovement.In 1995 schools with access to newspa-pers and those without suffered just asmuch from the leakages.And from 1995 toUganda’s macroeconomic stability since1992 has depended on budget reforms—from a cash budget system to the medium-term expenditure framework to the PovertyEradication Action Plan.The frameworkaligns resources with budgetary priorities,while the cash budget system ensured thatoverall ﬁscal discipline is maintained ifthereare revenue shortfalls.The Poverty ActionFund has been particularly effective in ensur-ing that government spending priorities,such as primary education,receive neededfunds.It seems unlikely that universalprimary education would have been sus-tainable without these innovations in bud-getary institutions.The power of information in delivering funds for educationIn 1996 a public expenditure tracking sur-vey oflocal governments and primaryschools revealed that only 13 percent oftheper-student capitation grants made it to theschools in 1991–95.173In 1995 for everydollar spent on nonwage education itemsby the central government,only about 20cents reached the schools,with local gov-ernments capturing most ofthe funding.Poor students suffered disproportion-ately,because schools catering to themreceived even less than others.Indeed,mostpoor schools received nothing.Case studyevidence and other data showed that theschool funds were not going to other sec-tors either.The disbursements were rarely2001 both groups experienced a large dropin leakage.But the reduction in capture wassigniﬁcantly higher for the schools withaccess to newspapers,which increased theirfunding by 12 percentage points overschools that lacked newspapers.With an inexpensive policy action—theprovision ofmass information—Ugandadramatically reduced the capture ofa pub-lic program aimed at increasing access totextbooks and other instructional materi-als.Because poor people were less able thanothers to claim their entitlement from thedistrict ofﬁcials before the campaign,theybeneﬁted most from it.0199119931995200140003000200050006000Uganda shillings1992199410000Share of funds reaching the school80604010020Average capitation grant P1-P7Average share of fundsreaching the schoolsMedian share of fundsreaching the schoolsSource: Reinikka and Svensson (2001), Reinikka and Svens-son (2003a).Figure 2Amount of capitation grant dueschools actually received by schools, 1991–200108_pgs 62-63_Ch03Spotlight.qxd  8/14/03  3:14 PM  Page 63(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

64The well-being ofpoor people is the point ofmaking services work.The value ofpublicpolicy and expenditure is largely determinedby the value the poor attach to it.Whenpublicly provided and funded housing is leftvacant,174when food supplies are not eaten,when free but empty public health clinicsare bypassed in favor ofexpensive privatecare,175this money is wasted.Improving services means making theinterests ofpoor people matter more toproviders.Engaging poor clients in anactive role—as purchasers,as monitors,andas co-producers (the “short route”)—canimprove performance tremendously.How can public policy help poor peopleacquire better services through this route?By expanding the inﬂuence oftheir ownchoices.By having the income ofprovidersdepend more on the demands ofpoorclients.By increasing the purchasing powerofpoor people.And by providing betterinformation and a more competitive envi-ronment to improve the functioning ofser-vices.Where such choice is not feasible,governments can expand consumer powerby establishing procedures to make surecomplaints are acted on.Sad to say,governments and donors fre-quently neglect the possible role ofpoorclients in sustaining better services—ortreat that role merely as an instrument forachieving a technically determined out-come.Neither governments nor donors areaccustomed to asking the poor for advice.Recent initiatives have begun to redress thisthrough a variety ofways to increase partic-ipation by communities and civil society.But the potential for improvement has notyet been adequately tapped.176In short,the key is to enhance the powerofpoor clients in service provision.ThisReport and this chapter try to give the term“empowerment”a precise and concreteinterpretation.Speciﬁcally,the chapter dis-cusses the potential for poor people toinﬂuence services by:•Increasing their individual purchasingpower.•Increasing their collective power overproviders by organizing in groups.•Increasing their “capacity to aspire”177:allowing them to take advantage oftheﬁrst two by increasing the informationneeded to develop their personal sense ofcapability and entitlement.178When will strengthening the client-producer link matter most?In the framework ofchapter 3,improvingclient power—the short route ofservice deliv-ery—can overcome various weaknesses ofthelong route (ﬁgure 4.1),even when servicesremain the responsibility ofgovernment.Theclearest case is monitoring providers.Clientsare usually in a better position to see what isgoing on than most supervisors in govern-ment hierarchies—who provide the compactand management.When the policymaker-provider link is weak because ofscarce or difﬁ-cult-to-manage supervisory staff,clients maybe the only ones who regularly interact withproviders.As discussed several times in thisReport,improvements in basic education haveoften depended on participation by parents.Although parents cannot monitor all aspectsofeducation,they can monitor attendance byteachers and even illiterate parents can tell iftheir children are learning to read and write.Citizens as clients can also make up forshortcomings in the voice or politics relation-Clients and providers4chapter09_WDR_Ch04.qxd  8/14/03  8:09 AM  Page 64(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Clients and providers65ship.Ifgovernments cannot or will not try todetermine and act on the desires ofthe pub-lic,or ifthe desires ofpoor people are system-atically ignored,there may be few options forpoor communities but to develop mecha-nisms for getting services some other way.The greater the differences amongclients—their heterogeneity—the more thatdirect client power is likely to have an advan-tage relative to the “long route.”The greaterthe individual differences in preferences forthe type and quality ofservices provided,thegreater the importance ofdiscretion on thepart ofproviders and the more difﬁcult it isto monitor the use ofthis discretion centrally.Sometimes preferences differ geographically,so different levels ofgovernment may reﬂectthis variation.But for many services,the het-erogeneity ofpreferences applies all the waydown to the individual.Take courtesy andcomfort (caring) relative to technical skill(curing) in health delivery—or farmers withconstraints on their time and other workersin the same community with different con-straints.Certainly people differ in theamounts ofwater and electricity they want,given their other needs.Government struc-tures may not be ﬂexible enough to accom-modate this variety.And where local prefer-ences vary systematically between the poorand others,honoring poor people’s prefer-ences over those ofthe better-offcan be achallenge.For some collective action problems,gov-ernments may not be located at the correctlevel to solve them,no matter how willingthey are to pursue the interests ofthe poor.The boundaries ofthe political jurisdictionmay not correspond to the boundaries oftheproblem.So schools are often the mostappropriate unit for management and opera-tion.Sanitation services need communitypressure to ensure that everyone uses ﬁxed-point defecation,but they are often organizedaround communities that are larger orsmaller than villages,depending on the den-sity ofpopulation.A more active role forcommunities is needed in such cases.It is important to avoid romanticizingeither form ofincreasing client power—nei-ther choice nor participation is sufﬁcient forall services.Market failures and concerns forequity lead societies to want to improve orextend these services in the ﬁrst place.There isno reason to believe they are all self-correctivethrough replicating aspects ofthe free market.Similarly,some settlements constitutecommunities with sufﬁciently congruentinterests among members,egalitarian normsto protect the poor,mutual trust,and theability to mobilize information and to actcollectively—that is,they have social capi-tal.179But some clearly do not.How many vil-lages and urban neighborhoods are there inthe developing world? Hundreds ofthou-sands? Millions? And how many kinds ofsocial structures are represented? Ensuringthat poor people have a say in this variety ofcircumstances demands that policies beexamined and designed with a great deal oflocal knowledge and an understanding oflocal conﬂicts and inequalities.Pretendingotherwise will almost certainly do real harm.And some services,particularly for healthand modern water and sanitation,need tech-nical inputs to be successful.Patients—asindividuals or health boards—are goodjudges ofcourtesy and attendance.But theyare much less able to judge clinical quality orthe appropriate mix ofcurative and preven-tive services.And some health problems haveeffects that spill over community boundaries.Large pest-control initiatives and other formsofinfectious disease control may seem a lowpriority for any one group ofcitizens,yet willbe effective only when all participate.Ulti-mately,some wide-scale government inter-vention is necessary.Still,emphasizing thepower ofclients is a welcome tonic for thetop-down,technocratic orientation that hascharacterized much development thinkinguntil now.Figure 4.1Client power in the service delivery frameworkThe stateCitizens/clientsNonpoorPoorClient powerLongrouteofaccountabilityProvidersFrontlineOrganizationsShortrouteServices09_WDR_Ch04.qxd  8/14/03  8:09 AM  Page 65(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

66WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Increasing client power through choiceThe most direct way to get service providersto be accountable to the client is to makewhatever they get out ofthe transactiondepend on their meeting client needs anddesires.That is,money (usually) or other ben-eﬁts from providing the service should followthe client—the enforceability ofa relationshipofaccountability,discussed in chapter 3.In market transactions,this is done by abuyer paying money to a seller.But that isnot the only way.Payments by governmentto schools (and the pay ofteachers) candepend on the number ofstudents enrolledand continuing.The vast majority ofpri-mary education in the Netherlands is paidfor by government but delivered by privateschools compensated in this way.Capita-tion lists are the dominant method ofpayfor general practice medical providers inseveral European systems,particularly theUnited Kingdom.Overall consumer satis-faction can be expressed through the possi-bility ofchanging general practitioners,determining their income.Vouchers issued to consumers are anothermethod oflinking service provider compen-sation to consumer choices,even though theconsumer is not the original source offunds.All health insurance with some choice ofprovider is a form ofvoucher—one condi-tional on being sick.And intrinsically moti-vated providers,whose sense ofself-worthdepends on having a large demand for theirservices,try for more patients under any pay-ment system.The essence ofeach ofthesemethods is that client well-being translatesdirectly into provider well-being—the incen-tives are aligned.Many service problems can be improvedby making sure that payment follows clients.Most ofthe evidence for this comes fromstudies examining the effect offees on thebehavior ofprivate providers (who must,ofcourse,operate this way) but it applies to allsuch methods.Payment can have four kindsofbeneﬁcial effects:•Improve provider behavior.•Increase supply and sustainability.•Increase vigilance and a stake in receiv-ing better service from each transaction.•Make better choices about which ser-vices to demand.The ﬁrst two work through providers,thesecond two through clients.Provider behavior Discourtesy,social distance,abruptness ofcare,discrimination against women and eth-nic minorities,service characteristics mis-matched to individual tastes—all are associ-ated with provider behavior.And all canimprove with the purchasing power ofclients.Indeed,that is why the private sectoris often seen as preferable to a public sectorwith staffpaid by salaries (box 4.1).Thesedifferences are echoed in studies from coun-tries as diverse as Bangladesh,China,India,Lao PDR,Thailand,and Vietnam.For courtesy,caring,and convenience theprivate sector usually has a distinct advan-tage.Private practitioners usually provideservices more convenient to the client.Lim-ited hours in public facilities (only in themorning in farm communities) is often thereason people go to a private practitioner.180What accounts for the difference? Not thetraining but the motivation:“...the samegovernment doctor who was not easily orconveniently accessible,whose medicationwas not satisfactory and whose manner wasbrusque and indifferent transformed into aperfectly nice and capable doctor when hewas seeing a patient in his private practice.”181Why? Because the doctor wants the client toreturn.Ifthe staffis paid through salaries,there is no strong incentive to be accommo-dating.This is not lost on clients:“Anyhow,they will get their money,so they don’t paymuch attention.”182Discrimination,particu-larly against ethnic minorities and women,and social distance are barriers to serviceseven when the services are free,barriers thatfrequently yield to market forces.183The arti-ﬁcial scarcity offree services—ensuringexcess demand—induces rationing by someother means (social status,personal connec-tions,ethnicity),and poor people rarely havethese other means.Groups coping with socialstigma—such as prostitutes,who need to bepart ofthe battle against HIV/AIDS—oftenprefer the conﬁdentiality and more consider-ate behavior in private clinics.09_WDR_Ch04.qxd  8/14/03  8:09 AM  Page 66(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Clients and providers67The scarcity ofcommodities due to lowpricing may lead to other commonlyreported problems—illicit sale ofmaterialsand the demand for under-the-counter pay-ments.Indeed,“free”public services are oftenvery expensive.Many countries have seriousdiversions ofpharmaceuticals from the pub-lic stock into private markets,where theyinstantly become expensive.In general,ser-vices that most directly resemble marketgoods have a greater problem ofdiversionand implicit privatization.In Eastern Europe the health systems areoften ranked among the most corrupt ofpublic services (box 4.2).Under-the-tablepayments and pharmaceutical sales to openmarkets are the main elements in this assess-ment.Ifdirectives against such practices can-not be enforced,countervailing pressure isneeded (see box 3.6).Formalizing fees andputting purchasing power in the hands ofpoorer clients is one possible source ofsuchpressure.184Exemptions from fees can have perverseeffects by reducing this purchasing power.InBenin a measure to raise female schoolenrollment—waiving fees for girls—ledteachers to favor the enrollment ofboys andto raise informal fees for girls.185Ofcourse,the problem could have been solved by abol-ishing fees for everyone (ifthe teachers couldcontinue to be paid) or by closer monitoringand enforcement by education ofﬁcials.Butin a system that has problems paying teachersand weak administrative capacity,bolsteringthe ability ofgirls to pay with vouchers seemsmore likely to succeed.Increase and sustain supplyGreater purchasing power may simplyincrease supply and overcome bottlenecksdue to supply problems.In Bangladesh theFemale Secondary School program awardsscholarships to girls ifthey attend school reg-ularly and gives secondary schools a grantbased on the number ofgirls they enroll.Sec-ondary school enrollment in Bangladesh isincreasing,and faster for girls than for boys.Italso led to the establishment,at privateexpense,ofnew schools.Desires for single-sex schools and separate toilet facilities forgirls were mysteriously accommodated whengirls’attendance meant more money.True,there remain problems,such as ensuring thequality ofthe newly established schools,butthese are secondary to getting girls to school.The revenues that providers raise fromcharges at the point ofcollection are often thereason some services can continue at all.Much ofthe success ofthe Bamako Initiativein West Africa (see spotlight) stems from thesupply ofpharmaceuticals made possible bycharging users for them.Bamako Initiativevillages usually have drugs,other villages usu-ally don’t.Sustainability in piped water sys-tems is almost always equivalent to ﬁnancialBOX 4.1The private sector is preferred in AndhraPradesh,IndiaA study of consumer and producer attitudes was conducted in six districts in the southernIndian state of Andhra Pradesh.The study included 72 in-depth interviews and 24 focusgroups.PrivatePublicATTITUDES OF DOCTORS“They speak well, inquire about our health.”“Ask about everything from A to Z.”“Look after everyone equally.”“They take money . . . so give powerful medicine . . . treat better.”“Does not talk to me, does not bother (aboutmy feelings or the details of my problems).” “Don’t tell us what the problem is, ﬁrst check,give us medicines and ask us to go.”“They are supposed to give us Rs. 1000 and 15kg of rice for family planning operations; theygive us Rs. 500 and 10 kg rice and make us runaround for the rest.”“Anyhow they will get their money so theydon’t pay much attention.”CONVENIENCE“Treat us quickly. . . .”“We spend money but get cured faster.”“I know Mr. Reddy.

68WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004sustainability.There might be some subsidyelement included in pricing,but systems toget water to a private home depend oncharges for that water.Increased client stake—and vigilanceThe third argument for having money fol-low clients:when people buy things theymake sure they get them,and they pay moreattention to the quality ofwhat they get.Money is a profound source ofpower forpoor people.When Zambian truck driverswere expected to pay into a road fund,theytook turns policing a bridge crossing tomake sure overloaded trucks did not pass.Their money would have to be used to ﬁxthe bridge.Women living in slum areas ofRio de Janeiro proudly display bills theypaid for water and sanitation—it provestheir inclusion in society and their right toservices.186Farmers in southern Indiaexpect the same from irrigation services(box 4.3).Making better choicesFor some services consumer discretion isimportant for allocating resources efﬁciently.Households determine water and electricityuse,scarce goods that have costs associatedwith them.And facing marginal costs is theonly way to ensure efﬁcient use.The alterna-tives:wasted water leading to shortages,unreliable service with serious consequencesfor the safety ofthe water supply,and peri-odic cuts in electricity familiar to most peo-ple in developing countries.Protecting thepoor in network services can be achieved(assuming that meters work) with “lifeline”subsidies,in which the ﬁrst few essentialunits are free but full marginal costs are paidbeyond this level.In health care,as in water and electricity,more is not always better.Restrictingdemand for curative services by pricingfrees up providers,particularly publicproviders,to do preventive health,forwhich there is little private demand.187Asthe director ofa prominent nongovern-mental organization providing health careto the very poorest in Bangladesh puts it:“Ofcourse you must charge at least a tokenamount for services,otherwise you keepseeing people with paper cuts and otherminor things.”188Similarly,crowding atoutpatient clinics at public hospitals can becurtailed by charging enough so that peopleuse a cheaper level ofservice.All these advantages can be obtained inways other than charging fees at the point ofservice.As long as clients consider theresources used as belonging to them,the dis-cipline ofmarket-like mechanisms can beenforced.The Singapore Medical SavingsAccounts do this by allowing people to applyfunds not used for primary medical care toother purposes,such as pensions.189Coun-tries with scarce administrative personneland supervisory capacity may certainly wantto enlist clients as monitors,and marketmechanisms are one way ofdoing it.For any ofthese mechanisms to work,however,there must be a real choice withreal options.Otherwise,giving schools pay-Surveys in nine transition countries of Easternand Central Europe* asked:“In your opinion,inwhat area is bribery most common,widespread?”Health systems rank highest overall,but withanswers ranging from 11 percent in Bulgaria to48 percent in Slovakia.Since there has been anoverall contraction in public services with that ineconomic activity,the most likely reason is thatthese marketable services are naturally easy tocharge for and difﬁcult to maintain without infu-sions of funds from patients.BOX 4.2Bribery in EasternEurope*Bulgaria,Croatia,Czech Republic,Hungary,Poland,Romania,Slovakia,Slovenia,and Ukraine.Thediagram summarizes results averaged over thesecountries (weighted by population).Source:GfK Praha—Institute for Market Research(2001).Health27%Legal systemand police23%Ministries/offices16%Customs11%Education6%Other/I don’t know17%09_WDR_Ch04.qxd  8/14/03  8:10 AM  Page 68(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Clients and providers69ments on the basis ofenrollments is not farfrom what happens now in centrally ownedand managed school systems,with all theproblems we are trying to ﬁx.Conversely,market mechanisms with a natural monop-oly don’t improve matters either.There isno denying that sparsely populated ruralareas—where many ofthe world’s poorpeople live—are much more constrained bycompetitive supply than urban areas.Buteven these markets may be “contestable”inthe sense that other providers would be ableto enter the market ifthe current providerabused monopoly power or ifmonopolieswere periodically granted on the basis ofcompetitive bids.Policies to improve choiceChoice-based improvements alone cannot bea solution to the problem ofbad services forthe poor,though some may remain as instru-ments in a longer-run strategy by govern-ment.In some cases the market would beexpected to wither away as the state increasesits capabilities.In the meantime,three cate-gories ofpolicies can make the most out ofclients acting on their own behalf:•Increasing the power ofthe poor overproviders by providing them withﬁnance directly.•Increasing competition.•Increasing information about servicesand providers.Increasing the purchasing power ofthe poor.The big problem with services that can,inprinciple,be provided in markets is thatpoor people don’t have enough money topay for them.For market mechanisms tohelp the poor,their purchasing power mustbe increased.The voucher mechanisms dis-cussed are a direct way ofhandling this forspeciﬁc services.But additional mileage cancome from more ﬂexible transfers that canbe used for purposes that the family chooses.Flexible transfers can help to overcomethe weakness ofthe citizen-policymaker linkby giving poor people more direct say in whatgets delivered than even the political processwould give them—the transfers become theirmoney.Substantial work in South Africa hasshown the beneﬁcial effects ofcash pensionpayments on the health and well-being ofallmembers ofa family.190For services withlarge externalities,demand for the servicemay not be great enough,even when the ser-vice is free,so the Bolsa Escola program inBrazil paid families to send their children toschool,as did the secondary school programfor girls in Bangladesh,while the Education,Health,and Nutrition Program (Progresa) inMexico paid families to use preventive healthcare (see spotlight).Cash payments have problems though.First,giving unconstrained cash transfers topoor people is often not politically palatable.Second,cash payments always have to beadministratively targeted,which requiresdeterminations ofeligibility.Everyone likesmoney,so self-targeting ofcash transfers isnot possible.Ifa government has a hard timegetting goods and services into the hands ofthe poor,it may well have an even harder timegetting cash,or cash equivalents,to them.A conversation with farmers in Haryana state inIndia,who had been to see what had happenedin reforming Andhra Pradesh (AP):Q:“What did you learn when you visited AP?”A:“That the farmers are much poorer than us,but that they pay four times as much forwater”Q:“The farmers in AP cannot be happy aboutthat....”A:“They are happy,because now the irrigationdepartment is much more accountable tothem ...they know where the money goesand they have a say in how it is spent....”Q:“So then,you much richer farmers would bewilling to pay more?”A:“Only if the irrigation department makes thesame changes,otherwise we will refuse topay.”Q:“Ah,but this is just because there is a particu-lar Chief Minister who is pushing that now ...once he goes it will all go back to the sameold way.”A:“We also wondered about that,and so weasked the farmers in AP about that.They toldus that ‘no matter who is elected as CM,wewill never allow the government to againgive us free water.’”Source:World Bank staff.BOX 4.3Payment andaccountability09_WDR_Ch04.qxd  8/14/03  8:11 AM  Page 69(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

70WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Increasing the scope ofcompetition.Sometimes increasing competition merelymeans allowing a private sector to emergewhere laws previously restricted entry.Jor-dan,after years ofprohibition,allowed pri-vate universities in 1990.Ten years later,enrollments in these institutions accountedfor one-third ofall university students.Bangladesh has had a similar experience inthe past decade.This increase in competi-tion allows governments to increase enroll-ments without extremely regressive subsi-dies to public universities.Competition can also be encouraged byallowing subsidies to the poor to beportable between public and privateproviders.Private providers may not existsimply because the public sector is free.Governments can increase competition bychanging the form ofsubsidy from zeroprice to competitive prices,with cash orvoucher payments to compensate.Univer-sity education government loans,usable atany eligible institution,can increase compe-tition,improve quality in public facilities,and reduce subsidies for all but studentsfrom poor families.In some cases competition is not possible,at least not without substantial regulation.Health insurance markets are notoriouslyprone to failure,and competition withinthem can lead to both inefﬁcient andinequitable outcomes,since ﬁrms can com-pete by excluding the sick,not by being moreefﬁcient.Network services are also hard torun without a monopoly.But in each casethese markets can be contestable,capturingmuch ofthe beneﬁt ofcompetition.Some readers may think that the forego-ing arguments are just an attempted justiﬁca-tion for user fees.This is wrong,for all thereasons put forth here.So,to make things asclear as possible,the pros and cons ofuserfees in general are laid out in box 4.4.Thereare times when user fees are appropriate—and some when they are not.Based on theprimary goal ofmaking services work forpoor people,this Report argues against anyblanket policy on user fees that encompassesall services in all country circumstances.Increasing information to improve choices byconsumers.One critical limit to well-func-tioning competitive markets is the consumer’sawareness.The private sector is a mixed bag.Private “medical”providers vary from quitegood doctors (including senior specialistsfrom government hospitals in their off-hours)to totally unqualiﬁed,untrained people,someofwhom are downright dangerous.191Privateor NGO schools may cater to speciﬁc skills notprovided in public schools (foreign language,religious studies,arts and music) or they mayjust be proﬁteers.An essential part ofimprov-ing peoples’choices is to provide informationabout these providers.Many times,peoplesimply don’t know enough to choose better orworse services.And sometimes they identifygood medical care with powerful medi-cines—which is quite wrong and potentiallydangerous.Information can be advice to families onhow to choose schools or medical care-givers192or on how to take care ofthem-selves.This might be supplemented with var-ious certiﬁcation programs,standard setting,and laboratory checks (say,for water purity).Scorecards ofpublic services should also beextended to private or NGO providers.Onthe other side ofthe market,governmentmay want to directly improve the quality ofprivate services.Training,“partnership”arrangements,contracting,and other meansofengagement can all be tried.But attemptsto increase information should be subject torigorous evaluation (chapter 6).Increasing consumer powerthrough participationThe accountability ofproviders to clients canalso be achieved when people voice their con-cerns.In this case,enforceability is notthrough clients’money but through theirdirect interaction—encouragement and com-plaints.The scope for poor people to voicecomplaints individually is very small.In richcountries individuals get help from systems oftort law that can handle individual litigationand from government-sponsored ofﬁces ofconsumer protection or ombudsmen.Butthese are rare to nonexistent for the poor indeveloping countries (they don’t always workso well for the poor in rich countries either).Some problems for which voice might beexpected to work are intractable.Oneexample is corruption:the public might09_WDR_Ch04.qxd  8/14/03  8:11 AM  Page 70(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Clients and providers71resent under-the-table payments,but theremay be no incentive to complain if,say,adoctor is using public facilities and materi-als at the same time.Clients know that theservice is still cheaper than ifthey had to goto the market,and so do not complain.193There is a deeper constraint:even whenthere is an opportunity to redress com-plaints,monitoring and follow-through arepublic goods—the beneﬁts accrue to theentire group while the costs are borne by afew.This is true for communities as well asindividuals,but groups ofpeople generallyﬁnd it easier to elicit support from mem-bers than from individuals going it alone.So client power expressed outside markettransactions will almost always be expressedthrough collective action.Strengthening participation along theclient-provider link can ﬁx problems in thelong route ofgovernment provision.So com-munity groups that take on complaining,monitoring,and other means ofmaking surethings work properly would be expected atsome point to become institutionalizedwithin government (most likely local govern-ment),or possibly to be supplanted by gov-ernment as it improves.After all,collectiveThe wide range of services and countrycircumstances discussed in this Reportmakes it impossible to claim that a par-ticular level of user fees or none at all isappropriate in every case.User fees,aswith other public policy decisions,mustbalance protection of the poor,efﬁciency in allocation,and the abilityto guarantee that services can be imple-mented and sustained.The followingﬂowchart summarizes the argumentsand references in the text and raisesmost of the issues necessary in deter-mining whether user fees of any sortare appropriate in a given case.Threepoints:•First,“efﬁciency”is shorthand forstandard principles of publiceconomics (see any textbook) thatoften but not always require pricesthat equal social marginal cost andmay include subsidies,taxes,or otherinterventions independent of theirdistributional effects.For example,infectious disease control measureswill have a subsidy element becauseof their external effects regardless oftheir impact on poor people.•Second,it is assumed that all subsi-dies are paid for by taxes.The neteffect on poor people depends ontheir contribution to tax revenue(possibly substantial when taxes arebased on agricultural exports) and ontheir share of the deadweight lossthat taxes impose on the economy.•Third,even when prices are notcharged at point of service,commu-nities may want to makecontributions to capital costs by,say,helping to construct or maintainschools.BOX 4.4No blanket policy on user feesYesYesYesNoNoNoNoNoNoYesYesYesYesIs the service excludable?Possible to keep people who do not pay from beneﬁting?Do not charge for service (because you cannot).

Make first few visits for medical care per year free for everyone.Charge for service with exemptions for poor people. Targeting can be administrative, geographical, or via self-selection.Charge for service. Empirically, this may apply to many services. Example: for higher education institute loan programs without subsidy.Charges are a necessary evil. Requires honest appraisal of ability to deliver services along “long route.” If teachers or medical providers cannot be supervised and medical stores not maintained by government, then clients, by default, must bring purchasing power to bear. Revolving drug funds through the Bamako Initiative, irrigation charges (see box 4.3), possibly many others including primary education if government is not reliable.Charge fees at a level that balances distributional effects with efﬁciency.Water (taps left running), electricity (interrupted service from overuse). Also applies to curative care if staff time available for higher-priority public health activities is crowded out or to outpatient clinics at hospitals when less expensive to treat the same problems at lower-level facilities.Do not charge for service.

72WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004action is expensive—people,especially poorpeople,have more pressing things to do withtheir time.They will want to transfer thisresponsibility to permanent structures as fastas they can.194But local inputs and knowledge fromdirect participation may be needed for sometime,possibly permanently,and govern-ment can help make those inputs moreeffective.Education provides many ofthebetter illustrations.Parents are in the bestposition to see what is happening in schools,and schools are usually the unit in whichdecisions are most effectively made.So giv-ing parents power to inﬂuence school poli-cies often has beneﬁcial results.In the exam-ple ofEl Salvador’s Community-ManagedSchools Program (Educo—see spotlight),itwas the right to hire and ﬁre teachers andthe regularity ofvisits from the local educa-tion committee,staffed in part by parents,that led to the increases in teacher and stu-dent attendance and in test scores.Madhya Pradesh,India,has seen sub-stantial improvement in test scores,com-pletion rates,and literacy.195Communityinvolvement is strong in recruiting teachers,getting new schools built,and encouragingneighbors to enroll their children.Parentshave been helped by the ability to hire local,less-than-fully-trained teachers at a fractionofstandard pay scales for governmentteachers—with better results.This last aspect ofthe program compli-cates scaling up.The ability to avoid con-frontation with public sector unions hasbeen a great advantage.Will teachers’unions allow such recruitment to becomestandard?196Do teachers hired at low wagesexpect to be converted into full public ser-vants? For now,however,the involvementofcommunities in Madhya Pradesh,whichis much greater than in other states,hasmade a big difference in performance.Other policy initiatives that can alsomake client voice more effective includeoffering more convenient venues to aircomplaints.Several studies have shown thatthe relationship between parents and teach-ers is important:it should be supportive,respectful,and cooperative,not punitiveand confrontational.The success oflocalcommunities in improving education canthus be compromised by too aggressive astance.This is true for other professionals aswell.In Kerala,maintaining staffat a healthcenter became difﬁcult when local residentsmade too many demands on providers’time.197Beyond monitoring,communities canbe the appropriate locus for more directinputs,in effect becoming co-producers ofservices.Some services cannot be deliveredby state agencies very well because the envi-ronment is too complex and variable—andthe cost ofinteracting with very large num-bers ofpoor people is too great.198Sanita-tion programs often beneﬁt from local par-ticipation and inputs,since social relationsin communities are often the best guaran-tors ofcompliance with sanitation policiesand compliance must be universal ifthecommunity is to reap the health beneﬁts.Local perspective and knowledge are criti-cal in transmitting needed information.Theacceptability ofmessages on health-relatedhabits,preventive health measures,hygiene,sexual conduct,and other sensitive issues ismuch greater when those messages are con-veyed through informal face-to-face contactin discussions among small groups ofindi-viduals with similar backgrounds.Forinstance,organized discussions among infor-mal women’s groups can enhance the credi-bility and impact ofbehavior change efforts.It is possible,but unlikely,that outsiders maylearn enough oflocal mores to inﬂuence localconversations on these subjects.199Tapping local social capitalMany communities have evolved means ofsolving longstanding problems requiring col-lective action.When the beneﬁts ofcoopera-tion are great enough,there is a way to enforcerules,and where there are no private alterna-tives,organizations often emerge on theirown.200Communities have solved irrigation,forestry management,nutrition,and otherproblems.Recently,governments (sometimeswith help from donors) have started to learnfrom this experience,and have funded pro-jects and programs that rely on,and require,the formation oflocal user groups and com-mittees to choose and implement develop-ment projects.Rather than give transfers ofincome to individuals,which can be both09_WDR_Ch04.qxd  8/14/03  8:12 AM  Page 72(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Clients and providers73politically and administratively difﬁcult,gov-ernments have channeled money throughcommunity groups.The various approachesthat have been tried address two possibleweaknesses in the “long route”ofaccountabil-ity through governments:implementation,orthe “compact”by single-purpose user groups,and “voice,”which allows communities todecide on projects to undertake.A recent evaluation ofsix early socialfunds,most initiated in response to crises,found that the programs were progressive,though more between than withinregions.201Special-purpose user groups havebeen more common.In water supply andsanitation particularly,there are numerouscases ofbetter implementation throughsuch groups.In Côte d’Ivoire,when respon-sibility for rural water supply shifted fromcentral government to user groups,break-downs and costs were reduced.202Somelocal communities have used local contrac-tors,improving accountability and increas-ing efﬁciency through explicit contracts.203When governments,especially local govern-ments,are severely hampered in deliveringservices,these methods have the potential tobring about marked improvements.These programs are new—and changingas lessons emerge.Because oftheir potential,rigorous evaluation is a high priority.Whichaspects are replicable? How can pitfalls beavoided? Some ofthe emerging lessons stemfrom the difference between groups thatemerge spontaneously and those that are cre-ated from above for the purpose ofchannel-ing money.Capture.Groups constituted as a part ofpro-jects funded by outsiders may be particularlyprone to capture by elites.Local groups thatevolve as a result oflong-felt needs may ormay not be representative ofthe poorestpeople.But when those groups are used byhigher levels ofgovernment or by donors tochannel formerly unheard ofsums ofmoney,even representative groups tend tochange.In Indonesia,when participationwas mandated by national government to gothrough village councils,the increased par-ticipation ofsome members ofcommuni-ties was found to have a “crowding-out”effect on others,leading to a net reductionofparticipation.204More recent programs inIndonesia have beneﬁted from this experi-ence and have been designed to elicit morewidespread participation (see spotlight onthe Kecamatan Development Program).A real risk comes from the speed withwhich groups are constituted and funds dis-bursed.Elites can mobilize more quickly,master the rules ofsubmitting applications(ifthey can read and the majority ofthecommunity cannot),and present them-selves to the community as an effective con-duit for receiving such funds.In one Sahe-lian country a large fraction ofprojectfunds was diverted for personal gain.205Much ofthe blame lies with the speed atwhich donors want to disburse funds(chapter 11) and with the limits this puts onincentives and abilities to monitor thebehavior ofleaders.Rushing to create socialcapital where it does not exist can do moreharm than good.Ifthere were ever a casefor patience,this is it.It is not merely thecreation ofparticipatory formats but theencouragement ofthe abilities ofpoor peo-ple themselves that will have longer-lastingeffects.The policies to look for,then,maybe those ofeducation,freedom ofexpres-sion,transparency,and time.The problem ofcapture is not limited togroups created for investment purposes.Italso affects existing community groups andlocal governments.Both elitism and,inmany cases,gender (men as opposed towomen) can determine who dominates tra-ditional communities and local govern-ments.206It is not clear that elite capture isalways a problem.Wade (1988) proposesthat mobilizing community action mayrequire the leadership ofthe more educated,connected elite.The lessons,though,are tomake sure that either the types ofservicesfunded by such methods have substantialpublic good characteristics (putting healthand education in a sort of“gray”area) orthat the right to leadership is contestable.Developing government capacity.Somespecial-purpose user groups,better fundedthan local governments,have drawn offmore capable ofﬁcials to administer theirfunds (the same effect is seen at the nationallevel in other donor initiatives—see chapter09_WDR_Ch04.qxd  8/14/03  8:13 AM  Page 73(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

74WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 200411).One hypothesis is that this slows thedevelopment oflocal government capacity.But the opposite argument has also beenmade—that such groups are a catalyst fordeveloping local government capacity.Innortheast Brazil,social investment fundsled villagers to organize and petition higherlevels ofgovernment to,for example,guar-antee a teacher to staffa school built by thecommunity.207Sustainability.Participatory water pro-jects,underway since the 1930s and 1940s,have often improved water supply—at leastfor awhile.But at some point water pumpsand other pieces ofexpensive equipmentbreak down.Covering the capital cost(which is expensive) and obtaining thetechnical help (also expensive) have alwaysbeen the bottleneck for water projects inpoor areas.When a new infusion ofcapitalis necessary at short notice,the communitymust look either to donors or to regularsources offunds,such as taxes or other gen-eral revenue.Eight or nine years after theoriginal investment,are the donors stillaround? Do they have the same prioritiesthey originally had? Can they respondquickly to small individual requests? Oftennot.These demands will have to be met bylocal government,208and projects have beenevolving to work through them.Such projects may have been a great dealbetter than relying on inadequate govern-ment structures.The argument for them isstrongest where the current governmentsystem,especially the local government,isweak,with few prospects for changing anytime soon.This should,however,be a tactic thatsupports a longer-term strategy ofdevelop-ing governmental capacity—strategic incre-mentalism,discussed in chapter 3.Cautionis required when there appears to be atradeoffbetween improving services in theshort run and undermining delivery capac-ity in the longer run.And the political con-sequences ofparticipatory projects shouldbe the subject ofcareful evaluations.All thiscomplicates bringing these interventions toscale.It may be possible to replicate com-munity efforts in many places,but whetherthis is the best way to make sure services aredelivered to all people is one ofthe manyopen questions on the agenda.Client power in eight sizesTo sum up,increasing client power throughimproved choice or direct participation willbe important when people differ—are het-erogeneous in their preferences—or wheneither ofthe two legs ofthe long route toaccountability is problematic.In terms ofthe decision tree (ﬁgure 4.2) that deter-mines which ofthe eight types ofsolutionsis appropriate,client power matters at allthree decision points.Decision 1: Are politics pro-poor?Relianceon client power should vary with the capac-ity and orientation ofgovernment.Alsowith the question ofwhich level ofgovern-ment is problematic.When governments(central,local,or both) are pro-poor,theymay choose to enlist client groups as moni-tors or solicit their opinions regularly insizes 3 and 4.Sizes 5 through 8,however,require ways to avoid the problems ofgov-ernment.All four will involve getting infor-mation to clients on their entitlements toand the performance ofservices.When levels ofgovernment differ intheir commitment to poor people,the roleand sponsorship ofuser groups differ aswell.Ifcentral government is a better cham-pion ofpoor people,they may fund com-munities (ifpreferences vary betweenthem) or cash transfers or vouchers (ifpref-erences vary within them) in cases 7 and 8.Iflocal government is better,they can pro-vide or contract for these services.When nolevel ofgovernment is pro-poor,thendonors,ifthey are inclined to be involved atall,might choose to fund communitygroups or organizations within civil society,being careful not to undermine the devel-opment ofgovernment capacities.Decision 2: Does heterogeneity matter?Sizes 3,4,7,and 8 directly involve clients.When preferences differ by location thendecentralization to local government or tocommunity groups (depending on thecapacity and pro-poor orientation oftheformer) makes sense.Ifthey differ by indi-vidual,then purchasing power and compe-09_WDR_Ch04.qxd  8/14/03  8:13 AM  Page 74(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Clients and providers75tition for individual business are preferable.Providing information to clients is criticalfor translating their choices into better ser-vices.Decision 3: Is monitoring easy or hard?When monitoring is easier for clients thanfor governments (at any level) then clientinput may be required for sizes 2,4,6,and8.Parents ofchildren,patients,and net-work service users improve services eitherby choice in purchasing or by active partic-ipation.It is only in size 1,where government isperfectly capable ofproviding servicesdirectly,that client participation is optional.Possibly size 3 as well ifgovernment canaccommodate varying needs ofclients.Forall other cases,the client needs to be placedmore ﬁrmly at the center ofservice delivery.Figure 4.2Eight sizes ﬁt allCentral government financing with contracting.

If only the center isthe problem, local government might provide adequately withoutdirect client input.5Client power—experiment with providers.

Bystrengthening the power ofcommunitiesover service providers.Policymakers bal-anced this power with sustained centralinvolvement in subsidizing and regulat-ing services—and in guiding communitymanagement.The initiative improved the access,avail-ability,affordability,and use ofhealthservices.Over the more than 10 years ofimplementation in these three countries,community-owned services restored accessto primary and secondary health servicesfor more than 20 million people.Theyraised and sustained immunization cover-age.They increased the use ofservicesamong children and women in the poorestﬁfth ofthe populace.And they led to asharper decline in mortality in rural areasthan in urban areas.Despite the various targeting mecha-nisms,affordability remains a problem formany ofthe poorest families.But even withlimited inclusion ofthe poorest people,improvements were signiﬁcant.210Revitalizing health networksIn these three countries,serious disrup-tions to the situation ofhealth services hadoccurred during the 1980s as a result ofasevere economic recession and ﬁnancialindebtedness.The health budget in Beninwent from $3.31 per capita in 1983 to$2.69 in 1986.In Mali,rural infrastructurewas almost nonexistent,and in Guinea,health services had almost totally disap-peared—except in the capital city,Conakry—during the last years oftheSekou Toure regime.The vast majority ofpoor families in the three countries didnot have access to drugs and professionalhealth services.National immunizationcoverage was under 15 percent,and less•Standardizing diagnosis and treatmentand establishing regular supervision.Scaling up incrementallyThe Bamako approach was implementedgradually,with the support ofUNICEF,WHO,and the World Bank,building on avariety ofpilot projects.213Since the early1980s,it was progressively scaled up in thethree countries—from 44 health facilities inBenin to 400 in 2002,from 18 in Guinea to367,and from 1 in Mali to 559.This raisedthe population with access to serviceswithin 5 kilometers to 86 percent in Benin,60 percent in Guinea,and 40 percent inMali,covering more than 20 million peo-ple.Importantly,a legal framework wasdeveloped to support the contractual rela-tionship with communities,the cost-shar-ing arrangements,the availability ofessen-tial drugs,and community participationpolicies.Community associations andmanagement committees were registered aslegal entities with ability to receive publicfunds.Better health outcomes for poor peopleOver the 12 or so years ofimplementationin Benin and Guinea,and more than 7 yearsin Mali,health outcomes and health serviceuse improved signiﬁcantly.Under-ﬁve mor-Putting communities in charge ofhealth services in Benin,Guinea,and MaliIn some ofthe world’s poorest countries,putting communities in charge ofhealth services,and allowing them to chargefees and manage the proceeds,increased the accountability oflocal health staffand improved health services for the poor.the Bamako Initiativespotlight on Table 1Reaching out to beneﬁt the poorest groupsDisease Geographical Cross-subsidiesExempting the poortargetingtargetingFocus on the burden of Focus on rural areas.•Higher markup and •Exemptions left to the diseases of the poor: Larger subsidies toco-payments on discretion of malaria, diarrhea, poorer regionsdiseases with lower communitiesrespiratory infections, levels of priority•Exempted categories malnutrition, •High subsidies for include widows, reproductive healthchild health servicesorphans•Free immunization and oral rehydration therapy as well as promotion activities10_pgs 76-77_Ch04Spotlight.qxd  8/14/03  3:16 PM  Page 76(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Spotlight on the Bamako Initiative77ﬁed with the quality ofcare,although 48percent were not “fully”satisﬁed.Healthcare users found the availability ofdrugs tobe high (over 80 percent said drugs wereavailable) and the overall quality ofcare tobe good (91 percent).Greater access reduced travel costs,andthe availability ofdrugs reduced the need tovisit distant sources ofcare.Prices havebeen kept below those ofalternativesources.In Benin the median householdspending on curative care in a health centerwas $2 in 1989,less than halfthat at privateproviders ($5) or traditional healers ($7).217Poor people still saw price as a barrier.218And a large proportion ofthe poor still donot use key health services in all three coun-tries.In Benin and Guinea the health systemallowed for exemptions,and most healthcenters had revenue that they could haveused to subsidize the poorest,but almostnone did.Management committees typi-cally valued investment over redistribution.tality declined signiﬁcantly,even among thepoorest.The poor-rich gap narrowed in thethree countries (ﬁgures 1 and 2).In Guinea,the decline was steepest for the rural popu-lation and poorer groups.Immunization levels increased in allthree countries.214They are very high inBenin,close to 80 percent—one ofthehighest rates in Sub-Saharan Africa.Immu-nization rates are lower in Guinea and Mali,largely because ofproblems ofaccess (ﬁg-ure 3).Coverage ofother health interven-tions also increased.The use ofhealth ser-vices by children under ﬁve in Beninincreased from less than 0.1 visit per year tomore than 1.0.In Mali exclusive breastfeed-ing and the use ofprofessional services forantenatal care,215deliveries,and treatmentofdiarrhea and acute respiratory infectionsincreased for all groups,including thepoorest (ﬁgure 4).216In an independent evaluation in 1996 inBenin,75 percent ofinformants were satis-Community ﬁnancing—a seat at the tableThe community ﬁnancing ofkey opera-tional costs bought communities a seat atthe table.Donors and governments had tosystematically negotiate new activities withcommunity organizations.Governments inall three countries,with the support ofdonors,continued to subsidize health cen-ters,particularly to support revolving drugfunds in the poorest regions.In Benin andMali today the public subsidy to health ser-vices is about the same per capita for richand poor regions.In Guinea,however,pub-lic spending has beneﬁted richer groupsmost.But all three countries face the chal-lenge ofemphasizing household behaviorchange and protecting the poorest andmost vulnerable.Establishing mechanismsto subsidize and protect the poor remains apriority ofthe current reform process.10019962000199219881984198019761972200150300350400250450Deaths per thousandBenin averageGuinea averageMali averageGuinea poorBenin poorMali poorSource: Krippenberg and others 2003.

78The most important political ofﬁce is that ofpri-vate citizen.Louis D.BrandeisCitizens’voice in society and participationin politics connect them to the people whorepresent the state—politicians and policy-makers.Unlike the short route ofaccount-ability between clients and providers dis-cussed in chapter 4,the long route ofaccountability involves politics.Thataccountability has two parts:the relation-ship ofvoice between citizens and politi-cians and policymakers (discussed here) andthe relationship between policymakers andservice providers (discussed in chapter 6).This chapter asks several questions:Why don’t politicians in well-functioningdemocracies deliver education,health,andinfrastructure services more effectively topoor people even though they depend onpoor people’s votes? Why are public expen-ditures systematically allocated to con-struction projects and the salaries ofbulkystate administrations,often at the expenseofmaking services like schooling work?And why,when the government doesspend money on services that the poor relyon,such as primary health care,is servicequality so poor? Finally,what can citizens,particularly poor citizens,do when politi-cians fail to make services work for them? Empowering poor citizens by increasingtheir inﬂuence in policymaking and align-ing their interests with those ofthe non-poor can hold politicians more accountablefor universal service delivery.Elections,informed voting,and other traditionalvoice mechanisms should be strengthened,because these processes—and the informa-tion they generate—can make politicalcommitments more credible,helping toproduce better service outcomes.Non-governmental and civil society organiza-tions can help to amplify the voices ofthepoor,coordinate coalitions to overcometheir collective action problems,mediate ontheir behalfthrough redress mechanisms,and demand greater service accountability.Even when these measures have limitedscope,better information—through publicdisclosure,citizen-based budget analysis,service benchmarking,and program impactassessments—and an active,independentmedia can strengthen voice.Citizen voice and politicalaccountabilityFaced with classrooms without teachers,clin-ics without medicines,dry taps,unlit homes,and corrupt police,poor citizens often feelpowerless.219Elected representatives seemanswerable only to the more powerful inter-ests in society ifat all.When politicians areunaccountable to poor people as citizens,thelong route ofaccountability—connecting cit-izens with providers through politicians—breaks down,voice is weak,and providers canget away with delivering inadequate servicesto poor clients.220When poor citizens areempowered,whether on their own or inalliance with others,their demand foraccountability can make politicians respondin ways that compensate for weaknesses else-where in the service delivery chain.Services are politically powerfulFor poor people the only routine interactionwith the state may be at the delivery point ofservices.Election platforms show that politi-cians are very aware that poor people’s per-ceptions ofthe state are shaped by the qualityofservices.The 30-Baht Gold Card scheme inThailand promised inexpensive universalCitizens and politicians5chapter11_WDR_Ch05.qxd  8/14/03  8:35 AM  Page 78(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Citizens and politicians79healthcare and helped the Thai Rak Thaiparty win a landslide victory in the 2001 par-liamentary elections.221Service delivery wasimportant for the Labor party’s successful2001 election campaign in the United King-dom.A Prime Minister’s Delivery Unit hasbeen set up to monitor progress.222Even when services do not ﬁgure explicitlyin elections,politicians often seek to enlargetheir political base by providing free publicservices or lucrative service-related jobs totheir supporters.And people are increasinglyconcerned about accountability for servicesoutside the voting process.In Brazil,India,and South Africa civil society organizationsare analyzing the allocation and use ofpublicresources in the budget to understand theirimpact on the poor.223With so much politicalattention paid to services,why is the voicerelationship often so weak?Voice is the most complexaccountability relationship in service deliveryVoice is the relationship ofaccountabilitybetween citizens and politicians,the range ofmeasures through which citizens expresstheir preferences and inﬂuence politicians(ﬁgure 5.1).224Accountability in this contextis the willingness ofpoliticians to justify theiractions and to accept electoral,legal,oradministrative penalties ifthe justiﬁcation isfound lacking.As deﬁned in chapter 3,accountability must have the quality ofanswerability (the right to receive relevantinformation and explanation for actions),and enforceability (the right to impose sanc-tions ifthe information or rationale isdeemed inappropriate).225One complicationis that voice is not sufﬁcient for accountabil-ity;it may lead to answerability but it doesnot necessarily lead to enforceability.In principle,elections provide citizenswith both answerability (the right to assess acandidate’s record) and enforceability (votethe candidate in or out).In practice,democ-racies vary greatly on both dimensions,as domost attempts to exercise accountability.Cit-izen charters may spell out the service stan-dards and obligations ofpublic agenciestoward their clients,but without redress theobligations may not be enforceable.InMalaysia the client charters introduced forpublic agencies in 1993 do both,givingclients the right to redress through the PublicComplaints Bureau ifcorrective action fornoncompliance is not taken.226Another complication is that the voicerelationship links many citizens with manypoliticians—all with potentially very differ-ent interests.When services fail everyone,the voice ofall citizens (or even that ofthenon-poor alone) can put pressure on politi-cians to improve services for all citizens,including the poor.But when services failprimarily poor people,voice mechanismsoperate in much more difﬁcult political andsocial terrain.Elites can be indifferent aboutthe plight ofpoor people.227The politicalenvironment can swamp even well-orga-nized voice.Protest imposes large costs onthe poor when their interests clash withthose ofthe elite or those in authority.228Itthen matters whether society is homoge-neous or heterogeneous and whether thereis a strong sense ofinclusion,trusteeship,and intrinsic motivation in the social andpolitical leadership ofthe country.Toexpect poor people to carry the primaryburden ofexerting inﬂuence would beunfair—and unrealistic.Finally,voice is only the ﬁrst part ofthelong route ofaccountability.That compli-cates its impact on services,since the impactdepends also on the compact relationshipbetween policymakers and providers.Evenstrong voice may fail to make basic serviceswork for poor people because the compact isweak.But the reverse can also be true,as wasthe case in the former Soviet Union.Figure 5.1Voice in the service delivery frameworkVoiceThe statePoliticiansPolicymakersCitizens/clientsNonpoorPoorLongrouteofaccountabilityShortrouteCoalitions/inclusionServices11_WDR_Ch05.qxd  8/14/03  8:35 AM  Page 79(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

80WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Pro-poor and clientelist servicedelivery environmentsThat voice is complex still begs the questionofwhy,in societies where the average citizenis poor,services fail poor people.Theanswer has to do with whether servicedelivery settings are “pro-poor”or “clien-telist.”The distinction reﬂects the incentivesfacing politicians,whether services aredesigned to be universal and available to theaverage citizen or vulnerable to targeting to“clients”by political patrons,and,iffor-mally targeted to the poor,whether they arein practice captured by elites (table 5.1).Pro-poor settings are those in which politi-cians face strong incentives to address thegeneral interest.Clientelist political envi-ronments are those in which,even thoughthe average citizen is poor,politicians havestrong incentives to shift public spending tocater to special interests,to core supporters,or to “swing”voters.229When the averagecitizen is poor,catering to special interestsat the cost ofthe general interest is clien-telism.The distinction between pro-poor andclientelist is clearly an oversimpliﬁcation,but it provides a useful way ofthinkingabout service delivery mechanisms.High-quality services for all are less likely ifpoliti-cians cater to special interests rather than tothe interests ofthe average citizen.Makingservices work for poor people is obviouslymore difﬁcult in a clientelist environmentthan in a pro-poor environment.Less obvi-ously,ifdelivery mechanisms do notaccount for these speciﬁc country and ser-vice differences,they are likely to fail,andthe poor suffer.The interaction ofvoice and accountabilityWhen populations are heterogeneous,itmatters whose voices politicians and policy-makers hear and respond to.Where popula-tions are polarized around nonserviceissues—religious,ethnic,caste,or tribalbackground,for example—voters caremore about what politicians promise onthese polarizing issues than on services,giv-ing politicians incentives to pursue othergoals at the cost ofeffective services.Wherepolitics is based on identities and patron-age,the poor are unlikely to beneﬁt frompublic services unless they have the right“identity”or are the clients ofthose withpolitical power.In failed or captured statesvoice can become meaningless.Politicianshave neither the incentives nor the capacityto listen.Under what circumstances,then,is voicelikely to lead to greater accountability? Elec-tions can lead to improved services ifthepromises politicians make before elections arecredible.The framework ofcitizen rights,theright to information,service design,the inﬂu-ence ofthe media,and administrative proce-dures for redress and appeal are all importantfor voice.230So too is the effectiveness oftheinstitutions ofaccountability,such as parlia-Table 5.1Pro-poor and clientelist service environments when the average citizen is poorPoliticians’ Service delivery Inclusion Systemic incentivesexpenditure and exclusion service capture designPro-poorNo strong incentives to Promote universal Most poor people enjoy Nonecater to special interests,provision of broad the same access and preferring instead to basic services that service quality as address generalbeneﬁt large non-poor due to interestssegments of society, network, political, including poor social, or altruistic people and the reasonsnon-poorClientelistStrong incentives to Permit targeting to Poor people do not Systemic service capture cater to special interests, narrow groups of enjoy the same access by local or national elites; to core supporters, or to non-poor “clients” and service quality asultrapopulist governments “swing” votersand sometimes to the non-poor, though (such as “Curley poor people but with speciﬁc groups of pooreffects,” see box 5.2)features making “clients” may do soservices vulnerable to capture by non-poor11_WDR_Ch05.qxd  8/14/03  8:36 AM  Page 80(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Citizens and politicians81ments,courts,ombudsman,anticorruptioncommissions.And so too are higher stocks ofsocial capital,because they help overcome thecollective action problem underlying voice,particularly for poor people.231What can be done to strengthen voice,particularly for poor citizens,in demandingbetter services? The answer depends greatlyon the political setting,but in functioningdemocracies with elections and voting,atleast three things should be done.•Deepen understanding and awareness ofwhy the politics ofservice delivery is sooften clientelist and not pro-poor.•Ifthe politics is clientelist,consider whatchanges in the service delivery environ-ment might alter political incentives andimprove outcomes.•When choosing how to deliver services,factor in,to the extent possible,the pro-poor or clientelist inﬂuence ofpoliticalcompetition on the incentives for servicedelivery.Recognize and account for gov-ernment failure arising from clientelism.The politics of providing publicservices to poor peopleIn 1974 only 39 countries—one in four—were electoral democracies.By the end of2002,this had grown dramatically to 121governments—three in ﬁve.232Over the lastcentury,the percentage ofpeople living indemocracies with competitive multipartyelections and universal suffrage has increaseddramatically (ﬁgure 5.2).Rapid democratization has brought rep-resentation and liberties,but not rapidimprovements in services for poor peo-ple.233Most,ifnot all,new democracies arelow-income countries with substantialpoverty.Services available to poor people inthese young democracies seem to be notmuch different from those available in non-democracies.In some cases services areworse than those provided by ideologicallycommitted but nonelected governments insingle-party,socialist countries.Whethercountries have elections or not seems not tomatter for public perceptions ofcorrup-tion,and since corruption worsens servicedelivery for poor people,by implication forpublic perceptions ofeffective services.234Political incentives for basic servicesIfdelivered effectively,basic services such asprimary health care and primary educationbeneﬁt the poor disproportionately.Butdemocratically elected politicians in coun-tries where the median voter is likely to be apoor person,or where poor people consti-tute the majority ofvoters,often seem tohave little incentive to provide such basicservices.And voters seem unable tostrengthen incentives for politicians toensure better public services.Why? How politicians and voters make deci-sions and how politicians compete hold someanswers.235When politicians have incentivesto divert resources (including outright cor-ruption) and to make transfers to a fewclients at the expense ofmany,efforts to pro-vide broad public services are undermined.How easy it is for voters to learn about thecontributions ofpoliticians to a particularservice—and therefore for politicians toclaim credit for the service—differs consider-ably by service (box 5.1).The degree ofpolit-ical competition is important.For example,analysis suggests that an increase in the com-petitiveness ofelections seems to have a big-ger effect on primary school enrollment thanincreases in education spending.236Three factors therefore appear to beespecially important for inﬂuencing politi-cal incentives for service delivery:•How well voters are informed about thecontribution speciﬁc politicians or polit-ical parties make to their welfare.•Whether ideological or social polariza-tion reduces the weight voters place onpublic services in evaluating politicians.•Whether political competitors can makecredible promises about public serviceprovision before elections.Informed votersThe incentives for transfers targeted toinformedvoters are greater when voters ingeneral lack information about the qualityofpublic services and the role their electedrepresentatives play in affecting quality.Thesame is true ifuninformed voters are easilyswayed by political propaganda,or iftheyvote on the basis ofa candidate’s charismaor ethnic identity rather than record.Figure 5.2Democracy’s centuryWorld population by politySource: Freedom House (1999).0103040607090100205080Protectorate/colonialdependence190019502000PercentDemocracyRestricteddemocracyAuthoritarian/totalitarian regimesMonarchy(constitutional/traditional/absolute)    11_WDR_Ch05.qxd  8/14/03  8:36 AM  Page 81(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

82WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Informed voting can be costly.Detailedbehavioral studies show that voters tend toadopt simple rules ofthumb based on verylimited information about politics andpublic policies.237Most ofthe informationvoters use is likely to be essentially “free,”inthat it comes incidentally with the perfor-mance ofsocial and economic roles.238Thiskind ofinformation tends to vary widelyover the electorate,depending on occupa-tion,social setting,and cultural norms.Vot-ers also behave myopically,giving muchgreater weight to events around electiontimes or to service outputs that are immedi-ately visible.239In principle,citizens could employ vot-ing rules requiring very little informationand still motivate politicians to pursuepolicies in their interest—ifthey couldcoordinate their efforts.240It is harder forvoters to coordinate rewards or penaltiesfor basic health and education because ofthe difﬁculties in evaluating these servicesand attributing outcomes to politicians(see box 5.1).Transaction-intensive publicservices such as education and healthdepend on day-to-day provider behavior.Quality is hard to measure and attribute.Information deﬁciencies thus lead voters togive more credit to politicians for initiatingpublic works projects (including schoolconstruction),providing direct subsidiesfor essential commodities,and increasingemployment in the public sector (includinghiring teachers and doctors) than forensuring that teachers show up for classand can teach—or that doctors come toclinics and heal.Ifvoters vote with limited informationor ifthey are uncoordinated but can beswayed by propaganda or bribes,special-interest groups can capture policies by pro-viding campaign ﬁnance or mobilizingvotes.241These interest groups need not bedeﬁned along rich-poor lines.They couldbe organized coalitions ofvoters (such asfarmers or public sector employees) thatlobby politicians to protect their interests,pushing for targeted policies at the expenseofpolicies that would beneﬁt the many.Social polarizationSocial polarization can lead to voting basedon social,ethnic,or religious identity ratherthan policy or service delivery performance.This too limits political incentives to pursueWhen even the poorest of parents care deeplyabout educating their children,why is it so difﬁ-cult for them to do something to ensure thatthe village teacher actually shows up for workregularly? A political economy perspective onpublic service delivery suggests that basichealth and primary education are very difﬁcultto get right because they are transaction-inten-sive services with outcomes that dependcrucially on the judgment and behavior ofproviders,both difﬁcult to monitor continually,and on household behavior.•Learning takes place over long periods andthe beneﬁts of preventive health care are notalways obvious.Compared with other,morevisible public services—electricity or waterconnections,rural roads,law and order—monitoring basic education and health ser-vices makes large information demands onboth voters and politicians.•Poor voters may be uninformed because theyare illiterate.•Where populations are socially polarized or het-erogeneous,households are less likely to havecoordinated,clear preferences in health andeducation services.Furthermore,successful out-comes require supportive household behavior,and very heterogeneous social and culturalhousehold norms may make householdsrespond differently to public interventions.•Because of the difﬁculty of regularly monitor-ing these services and of measuring andattributing their long-term impact,it is harderfor politicians to claim credit for theseservices than for a road or a well.And politi-cians who promise to improve these servicesmay lack credibility and lose elections.Forthese reasons,politicians are likely to preferinfrastructure to human development,andare prone to using basic health and primaryeducation services as patronage for clients,rather than as universal services to beprovided for the general good.So when poor people are uninformed,soci-ety is polarized along social or religious lines,and politicians lack credibility or are prone toclientelism,basic public services for poor peopleare the most likely to suffer.Because of political problems of informationand credibility,public antipoverty programs aremore likely to take the form of private transfers,such as food subsidies,electricity subsidies,agri-cultural price protection,construction projects,and public sector employment.Programs of thiskind are easier to capture and more amenableto targeting than basic health and education,which are more suited to universal provision.*That is why programs narrowly “targeted”to thepoor may not be optimal in the sense of havingthe most impact on the economic well-being ofpoor people.*van de Walle (1998) concludes,from a synthesis ofresearch on public spending and the poor,that there isa well-substantiated case for “broad targeting”of thepoor by allocating greater resources to universal publicservices such as basic health and education.In contrast,ﬁnely targeted food subsidies or other redistributionschemes may sometimes be detrimental to the inter-ests of the poor due to the burden of administrativecosts and unintended behavioral responses.See alsovan de Walle and Nead (1995).BOX 5.1Why are public health and education services so difﬁcult to get to poor people?11_WDR_Ch05.qxd  8/14/03  8:37 AM  Page 82(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Citizens and politicians83public policies in the general public inter-est.James Curley,an Irish Roman Catholicmayor ofBoston in the ﬁrst halfofthe 20thcentury,fanned class and religious divisionsfor electoral advantage and was repeatedlyreelected despite the damage his policies didto the city’s growth (box 5.2).It is this effect ofsocial polarization onpolitical incentives that partly accounts forthe empirical evidence on the negative cor-relation between ethnic heterogeneity andthe availability ofpublic goods.242Moregenerally,basic public services,particularlythose that are not easily excludable such asprimary education,can also deterioratewhere there is social fragmentation—somesocial groups do not want to pay for publicgoods that beneﬁt other groups.243Credible politiciansEven when voters are informed,public pol-icy can fall short when the promises ofpoliticians are not credible.When candi-dates cannot or do not make crediblepromises before elections (because aban-doning promises costs election winners lit-tle),incumbents are more insulated fromthe disciplining effects ofpolitical competi-tion.Challengers cannot mount effectivecampaigns because they cannot convincevoters that they will do a better job.Fur-thermore,ifpoliticians are credible only totheir “clients,”more public resources will beallocated to these clients.This can havelarge implications for universal health andeducation services.Incumbents enjoygreater discretion to pursue goals otherthan those preferred by the majority ofciti-zens who may be poor,goals such as provid-ing narrowly targeted services to their sup-porters at the cost ofmore universal publicservices that beneﬁt all.244Credibility and credit go hand in hand.Credibility problems also arise when politi-cal competitors make credible promises buttheir term in ofﬁce is too short to claimcredit for policies with long maturing out-comes.Promises ofjobs or public worksprojects can be delivered soon after an elec-tion.But promises to improve educationquality and outcomes are much less credi-ble.Similarly,voters can easily credit apolitician for building a school or assigningteachers,but they can less easily verify thatthe politician is responsible when the build-ing is maintained or supplied,or when theteacher is present and competent.Ifpoliti-cians cannot take credit for their efforts toimprove teacher quality,teacher quality islikely to be low—and voters are unlikely toexpect anything else.In Pakistan nonprofes-sional considerations have been common inthe placement ofteachers.245The incentivesfacing local politicians have been importantfactors in the low quality ofrural schools(box 5.3).In many countries,politicians do notcampaign on their policy record,probity,orhistory ofprogram involvement or on thepolicy record oftheir party.Voters then arelikely to believe politicians who have shownthemselves to be reliable sources ofpersonalassistance.They might be locally inﬂuentialpeople who have helped families by provid-ing loans or jobs or by resolving bureau-cratic difﬁculties.Without well-developedpolitical parties or national leaders who arecredible,promises oftargeted favors are allthat voters can rely on in making electoralchoices.Described as “The Rascal King,”JamesMichael Curley dominated politics in Bostonfor half the 20th century,holding electedofﬁce,among others,as four-time city mayorbetween 1913 and 1950,besides servingtwo prison terms on corruption charges.Admired by working-class Irish families,Cur-ley was noted for his railing against theProtestant Yankee establishment and for hisrough-and-tumble ways.Curley used patronage,cash,and rhetoricto shape his electorate,driving the richerProtestant citizens out of the city to ensurehis political longevity.Curley’s tools ofpatronage were public services,large con-struction projects,and public employment.In his ﬁrst year as mayor,Curley raised thesalaries of police patrolmen and school cus-todians but cut the salaries of higher-rankingpolice ofﬁcers and school doctors (Beatty1992).Miles of sidewalks were laid in Irishneighborhoods,but the cobblestones ofswank Yankee neighborhoods crumbled(O’Connor 1995).Boston did not ﬂourishunder Curley:between 1910 and 1950,it hadthe lowest population growth rate of anyU.S.city of comparable size.Glaeser and Shleifer (2002) call this the“Curley effect”—increasing the size of one’spolitical base,or maintaining it,through dis-tortionary,wealth-reducing policies.They useit to shed light on the ethnic and class politicsof service delivery when the net effect is toimpoverish the overall community.They showhow the Curley effect may apply to Detroit,USA,to contemporary Zimbabwe,and to theLabor party in the United Kingdom before itscurrent reincarnation as New Labor.The Curley effect demonstrates thatclientelism need not beneﬁt only rich clients.It can beneﬁt poor clients as well,and stillimply substantial losses in efﬁciency throughthe misallocation of public resources.So,clientelism results in inefﬁcient,targeted allo-cations that beneﬁt only a few,as opposed toallocations to universal public services thatbeneﬁt larger segments of the same poorand not-so-poor populations.Sources:Glaeser and Shleifer (2002),O’Connor(1995),and Beatty (1992).BOX 5.2The “Curley effect”11_WDR_Ch05.qxd  8/14/03  8:37 AM

84WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Credibility can make change difﬁcult.Problems ofpolitical credibility can causebad policies to become entrenched.Coun-tries often adopt poverty strategies based onsubsidies for consumption and agriculturalproduction,sometimes at the expense ofbroad public services such as education andhealth that might have resulted in lowerpoverty and more economic growth.Indiasubsidizes electricity,ostensibly for poorfarmers.Once political credibility is stronglylinked to a particular policy such as deliver-ing subsidized electricity,these policies con-tinue to receive greater public resources thanthey would ifall political promises wereequally credible.Vested interests developaround suboptimal policies—rich farmerscapture the power subsidy—which makeschange even more difﬁcult.ClientelismClientelism is characterized by an excessivetendency for political patrons to provideprivate rewards to clients.Politicians allo-cate public spending to win elections.To doso,they can provide public goods that canimprove everyone’s welfare (public goodsthat are extensive,such as law and order,universal education,with no rivalry orexcludability).Or they can target localities(local public goods,projects limited to ajurisdiction) or individuals and speciﬁcgroups (clientelism).246What distinguishes clientelism? Clien-telism implies a credible threat ofexclusionfrom a stream ofbeneﬁts ifthe voterchooses to vote for the opposition.247Thusan incumbent politician can use clientelismto deter core supporters from switchingsupport.Clientelism is hard to pursue forlocal or extensive public goods—beneﬁcia-ries are not reliable clients because they cansupport the opposition and still beneﬁt.The Programa Nacional de Solidaridad(PRONASOL) poverty alleviation programin Mexico spent an average of1.2 percent ofGDP annually on water,electricity,nutri-tion,and education in poor communitiesbetween 1989 and 1994.248Municipalitiesdominated by the Institutional Revolution-ary Party (PRI),the party in power,receivedsigniﬁcantly higher per capita transfers thanmunicipalities that voted in another party(ﬁgure 5.3).An assessment ofPRONASOLspending suggests that it reduced poverty byonly about 3 percent.Had the budget beendistributed for impact on poverty ratherthan party loyalty,the expected declinewould have been 64 percent with perfect tar-geting,and it would have been 13 percenteven with an untargeted,universal propor-tional transfer to the whole population.249Even ifvoters want to vote for an opposi-tion party or candidate,they might bedeterred by the fear ofbeing penalized bythe withholding offunds by a centralauthority.So voters may end up keeping aparty they may dislike in power in order toensure funding for local public services.This is compounded by a coordinationproblem.Even ifthe majority oflocalitieswanted to vote against the incumbent party,without certainty about what other locali-ties planned to do,the majority would endup supporting the ruling party to avoidstrategic miscoordination and the penaltyofloss offunds.Clientelism can also be the outcome ofpolitical competition when the credibilityofpolitical competitors is limited—politi-cal promises are credible only to “clients.”250Politicians with clientelist ties can fulﬁllcampaign promises better than politiciansElected ofﬁcials in Pakistan have demon-strated an extraordinary interest in target-ing services to their supporters,but muchless interest in services such as primary edu-cation that all voters can enjoy.Contribut-ing to this outcome are three aspects ofrural Pakistani politics:identity-driven poli-tics,voting blocs that make it easy to iden-tify core supporters,and costly elections.Voter ignorance,poor information onpolitical competitors,and the absence ofparty credibility on broad policy issuesencourage politicians and voters to buildpersonal relationships that make pre-elec-tion promises more credible.Because theserelationships are personal,they tend to bebased on narrow,excludable servicespromised and delivered to core supporters.The distance between rural communitiesboosts the political efﬁciency of targetingpolitical beneﬁts—it is easier to site schools,roads,and water pipes close to supportersand far from nonsupporters.Voting by blocs of supporters makespatronage a more effective political strategythan the provision of well-functioningservices that must be provided to all.Costlyelections drive politicians to provide publicservices to supporters who can be dependedon to vote for them at low out-of-pocket cost.Under these conditions,schools mayget built for the corruption,employment,and proﬁt opportunities that constructionprovides.Teachers are hired less on meritand more on how best to apportion patron-age,particularly when absenteeism is notpenalized.There are,in contrast,fewsystemic political incentives to make sureschools run well,teachers remain account-able,and children learn.Source:World Bank (2002l).BOX 5.3Better to build rural schools than to run themwell in Pakistan11_WDR_Ch05.qxd  8/14/03  8:38 AM  Page 84(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Citizens and politicians85without them.When only clientelist promisesare credible,promises ofconstruction andgovernment jobs become the currency ofpolitical competition at the expense ofuni-versal access to high-quality education andhealth care (as seen in box 5.3).Public worksor jobs can be targeted to individuals andgroups ofvoters—clear evidence ofpoliticalpatrons fulﬁlling their promises to clients.Itis much more difﬁcult to target the services ofa well-run village primary school or clinic.Cross-country evidence on public invest-ment supports the contention that credibil-ity and clientelism signiﬁcantly inﬂuencethe provision ofpublic services.There areno variables that directly capture the credi-bility ofpre-electoral promises or the extentofclientelism.But it is possible to argue thatin young democracies political competitorsare less likely to be able to make crediblepromises to all voters and are more likely torely on clientelist promises,and as thesedemocracies age,politicians are more likelyto increase the number ofclients since theycan count on client loyalty.A study sum-marizing the evidence shows that targetedspending—public investment—is higher inyoung democracies than in old and as young democracies age,targeted spendingincreases.251Corruption falls as democraciesage.These results are relevant for universalbasic services since they are likely to be oflower quantity when public investment ishigh and oflower quality when corruptionis high.Similar cross-country evidence onsecondary and primary school enrollmentsupports the view that credibility is a signiﬁ-cant inﬂuence on the provision ofpublicservices.252Beyond the ballot box:citizen initiatives to increaseaccountabilityWhen elections are not enough to make ser-vices work for poor people,political pres-sure builds for new approaches that enablecitizens to hold politicians and policymak-ers more directly accountable for services.These activities do not replace the electoralprocess,but complement it to strengthenthe long route ofaccountability.The emer-gence ofsuch citizen initiatives and theirmobilizing potential has been accompaniedby an information revolution that has dra-matically simpliﬁed information exchangeand citizen access to ofﬁcial information.Enthusiasm for direct citizen involve-ment also comes from mounting frustrationwith the dominant mode ofa national civilservice delivering services that meet sometechnically predetermined “needs”ofthepopulation.253This frustration has led togreater interest in directly empowering citi-zens and overcoming collective action prob-lems,driven also by the ﬁnding that civicrelationships and social capital are impor-tant determinants ofgovernment efﬁcacy.254Broad range ofissues and toolsThe rapid growth ofcitizen initiatives hasbeen described as a new accountabilityagenda.It involves “a more direct role forordinary people and their associations indemanding accountability across a morediverse set ofjurisdictions,using anexpanded repertoire ofmethods,on thebasis ofa more exacting standard ofsocialjustice.”255Citizens are combining electoralaccountability and participation with whatwould traditionally have been consideredthe ofﬁcial accountability activities ofthestate.These initiatives address accountabil-ity at various levels.Some are aimed atstrengthening voice in service delivery byenabling answerability and some at pushingfurther for enforceability.These initiatives,and the state’s response,employ a numberofold and new tools,including tools basedon information technology.These citizen initiatives cover a far-reach-ing array ofissues,from improving law andorder in Karachi256to preparing citizenreport cards.They vary tremendously inscale,ranging from global knowledge-shar-ing coalitions,such as Shack/Slum Dwellers’International,257to community efforts inMumbai to monitor arrivals ofsubsidizedgoods at local “fair price”shops in order toexpose fraud in India’s public distributionsystem targeted to the poor.258They also varyin depth and reach.On election reform,theyrange from generating background informa-tion on election candidates and their perfor-mance in Argentina (Poder Ciudadano259) tocivil society efforts to implement and sustainFigure 5.3It paid to vote for PRIMexico: PRONASOL expenditures accordingto party in municipal governmentNote:PRI = Institutional Revolutionary Party;PRD = Party of the Democratic Revolution; PAN = National Action Party.Source:Estévez, Magaloni, and Diaz-Cayeros(2002).0198919901991199219931994PRIPRDPANOther200100300400Average expenditures per capita (real 1995 pesos)11_WDR_Ch05.qxd  8/14/03  8:38 AM  Page 85(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

endseek to make national budgets accessible tocitizens and at the other to promote village-level participatory audits oflocal publicexpenditures (box 5.4).These citizen initiatives also use a broadrange oftools,from door-to-door signaturecampaigns to cyber-activism.The rapidgrowth ofthe Internet and communicationtechnologies has dramatically altered citizenvoice nationally and internationally,thoughaccess is still limited by income and connec-tivity.Some innovative e-government appli-cations are reducing corruption and deliverytimes and increasing service predictabilityand convenience.Karnataka,among India’sleading states in information technology,has pioneered a computerized land recordssystem to serve rural households (box 5.5).Controversy and conﬂict ofinterestTwo separate trends are discernible in citi-zen voice initiatives:activities based on con-sultation,dialogue,and information shar-ing,and activities more direct andcontroversial,related to monitoring,com-pliance,and auditing.Some activities startwith indirect objectives,build internalcapacity and external trust,and then ven-ture into more difﬁcult areas.The impact ofthese initiatives varies according to howthey are perceived by politicians and policy-makers and the government’s receptivity tochange.Several studies link this receptivityto the stock ofsocial capital.260One concern with some citizen initiativesis that they can lead to conﬂicts ofinterestand reduced accountability to poor people.Facing funding uncertainties,many non-governmental organizations seek to diversify,starting from voice activities but moving onto actual service delivery.When they becomeadvocates and providers at the same time,there can be intrinsic conﬂicts ofinterest.261NGOs may suffer from their own lack ofaccountability,internal democratic deﬁcits,and gaps in their mandates.262The award oflarge service delivery contracts to a few bigcivil society organizations can exclude andspell ﬁnancial difﬁculties for smaller organi-zations.263And ifcommunity and civicgroups are captured by unscrupulous leaders,they can manipulate funding agencies andbeneﬁciaries for their own gain.264Information strategies to strengthen voice Policies that increase information and coor-dination in voting,enhance the credibility ofpolitical promises,and increase the ability ofcivil society organizations to hold politiciansThe budget,a primary statement of governmentpriorities,is for many citizens a black box,moni-tored and assessed only by the traditional inter-nal accountability relationships within govern-ment.But it can be a crucial tool for citizens toinﬂuence and monitor public policy and ser-vices.Accordingly,participatory budgeting ini-tiatives are increasing rapidly in several coun-tries.The challenge is to build the capacity ofcitizen groups,to give politicians and policy-makers the incentives to listen and act on citi-zen feedback,and to put out budgets that areunderstandable and interesting to citizens.Budget planningThe most well-knownbudget planning initiatives come from citymunicipalities in Brazil,such as Porto Alegre andBelo Horizonte.Neighborhoods indicate theirspending needs at budget forums,and delegatesthen bring these needs to assemblies,ensuringcitizen voice in budget allocations andimplementation.Budget monitoringThe Institute for aDemocratic South Africa makes informationabout provincial and national budgetallocations accessible to citizens.Its technicalexperts break public budgets down to facilitatepublic comment.Special reports show howmuch money is allocated,say,to gender-relatedand children’s issues.The most direct inﬂuenceof its work is in strengthening the ability ofparliamentarians to participate more effectivelyin budget discussions.Budget auditingThe Mazdoor Kisan ShaktiSanghathan (MKSS),a grassroots organization inthe north Indian state of Rajasthan,has turnedordinary citizens into ﬁnancial auditors.Its keyinnovation has been the jan sunwai(or publichearing),an open-air forum at which ofﬁcialrecords are presented alongside the testimonyderived from interviews with local people.“Many

Citizens and politicians87and policymakers accountable are likely toimprove services for poor people.Conversely,the lack oftransparency in information dis-closure can come at a high price.Cases dur-ing the earliest phase ofthe outbreak ofSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome in mid-November 2002 in China were not openlyreported,which allowed a new and severedisease to become silently established in waysthat made further spread almost inevitable.265Information campaigns have dramaticallyaltered the behavior ofpoliticians and policy-makers,but many have also failed to inducechange.Understanding when informationcampaigns can succeed is thus critical.What makes for a successfulinformation strategy?Tracer studies ofspending on Ugandan edu-cation revealed leakages as high as 90 per-cent.Once the information was publicized,the budgeted resources reaching schoolsrose dramatically.266Studies suggest thatnewspaper readership and availability inIndia spur state governments to respond tofood crises.267In Buenos Aires,publishingthe wildly different procurement prices paidby city hospitals for similar products led torapid convergence ofprices.268What didthese information strategies have in com-mon? The information was speciﬁc.Politicalinterest in addressing the problem was high.And the information was electorally salient.Speciﬁc information.The informationidentiﬁed speciﬁc government decisions,spe-ciﬁc decisionmakers,and the effect ofthedecision on the voters individually or as agroup.That made benchmarking—system-atic comparisons across time or space—easy.The Uganda information was not about thegeneral quality ofeducation or general budgetsupport,or even about leakage from nationaleducation budgets.It was about one type oftransfer—capitation grants—disaggregatedto the school level,responsibility for whichwas easy for parents and voters to assign to theschool principal.In addition,the informationmade clear to voters what the school shouldhave received.The information in BuenosAires was also speciﬁc to individual hospitals.Government responses to food crisesshow how the provision ofhigh-level infor-mation is politically enforceable by voters.First,a food crisis is a single,speciﬁc issue.Second,responsibility for it is known to restultimately in the state chiefminister’s ofﬁce.Third,there are no complicated issues ofquality measurement—voters know imme-diately that they are beneﬁting ifthey receiveassistance.Benchmarking is a bit more com-plicated but still doable.Voters know ifoth-ers less deserving receive assistance.But theydo not know what effort governmentsshould make in responding to food crises(which is different from the benchmarks inthe Uganda tracer studies,where votersknew exactly how much money should havereached individual schools).269Strong political or bureaucratic interest incorrecting the problem.In some cases(Uganda and possibly Buenos Aires),national politicians did not beneﬁt,andpotentially lost,from leakages or inefﬁcien-cies.That is,corruption was the product ofKarnataka state in India has pioneered Bhoomi(meaning land),a computerized land record sys-tem serving 6.7 million rural clients.Its mainfunction is to maintain records of rights,tenancy,and cultivation—crucial for transferringor inheriting land and obtaining loans.Startedin 1991 as a pilot,the Bhoomi system now haskiosks in each of the state’s 177 subdistricts,ser-vicing some 30,000 villages.Under the old system,applicants faced longdelays (3–30 days),and nearly two out of threeclients paid a bribe—70 percent paid more thanRs.100 (the ofﬁcial service fee was Rs.2).Therewas little transparency in record maintenance—the village accountant controlled the process,with little ofﬁcial or client monitoring.Evenwhere there was no fraud,the record systemcould not easily handle the division of land intovery small lots over generations.Farmers can now get these records in 5–30minutes and ﬁle for changes at a Bhoomi kiosk.The entire process takes place in the vernacular,Kannada.Clients can watch a second computerscreen facing them as their request is processed.Users pay a fee of Rs.15.In a recent evaluation,only 3 percent of users reported paying a bribe.The evaluation estimates that on averageBhoomi annually saves clients 1.32 million workdays in waiting time and (net of the higher userfee) Rs.806 million in bribesThe resistance of village accountants had tobe overcome in implementing Bhoomi.Thechief minister,revenue minister,and members ofthe legislature championed Bhoomi,whichhelped.There are now plans to expand beyondland transactions.The Indian government hassuggested that other states consider similar sys-tems to improve accountability and efﬁciency inservices that are vital to rural households.Sources:World Bank staff and Lobo and Balakrish-nan (2002).BOX 5.5Down to earth: information technology improves rural service delivery11_WDR_Ch05.qxd  8/14/03  8:39 AM  Page 87(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

88WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004bureaucratic shirking rather than politicalrent-seeking.Education had become amajor issue for the president ofUganda,and his reputation was on the line.He hadmade public promises,followed by thehighly visible action oftransferring morefunds to local schools.His ability to fulﬁllthose promises was being undermined bybureaucratic malfeasance.Once the malfea-sance was revealed,the fear ofsanctions wasenough to hold individual bureaucratsaccountable and produce rapid change.In other cases,such as assistance in afood crisis,there is considerably more roomfor shirking.Citizens ﬁnd it difﬁcult toknow how large the crisis is,what resourcesare available,and how efﬁciently and equi-tably the resources are distributed.Thisuncertainty leaves room for political inac-tion.But the consequences ofgovernmentinaction—starvation deaths and theirreports in the media—are grave enough totarnish the chiefexecutive’s reputation,which gives the state administration amajor reason to avoid them.Famines donot occur in democratic countries,evenvery poor ones,because the survival ofthegovernment would be threatened by theopposition and by newspapers and othermedia.270And the more citizens areinformed about the crisis and the neededresponse,the more likely they are to holdpoliticians electorally accountable.The issue is important electorally.Politi-cians are not interested in improving perfor-mance ifvoters do not care.Voters can bewell informed and know who the responsi-ble politician is,but still not hold the politi-cian accountable because other issues loomlarger.Where conﬂict is rife,or society ispolarized,the politician’s stance on conﬂictor polarization may dominate voter atten-tion,allowing the politician to get away withpoor performance on other issues.InUganda,the president made education acentral part ofhis election manifesto.InBuenos Aires,municipal politicians mayhave been concerned that voters would viewthe corruption in hospitals as indicative ofdeeper problems ofmalfeasance,in the citygovernment and,because Buenos Aires isthe capital,in other cities and the country.Citizen report cards: information as political actionOther information strategies look directly atpublic service outputs (quality and quantityofservices provided by government) ratherthan inputs (prices paid,budgets committedand delivered).The best known are the citi-zen report cards developed by the PublicAffairs Centre in Bangalore,India.271Citi-zens are asked to rate service access and qual-ity and to report on corruption and generalgrievances about public services.Citizenreport cards have spread to cities in thePhilippines,Ukraine,and,on a pilot basis,Vietnam.They have recently been scaled upin India to cover urban and rural services in24 states.272The results have stimulated con-siderable media,bureaucratic,and politicalattention and acknowledgment oftheir con-tribution to service improvements.Because citizen report cards focus on ser-vice outcomes,they do not provide voters withinformation about speciﬁc decisions that spe-ciﬁc policymakers have made—or not made.Nor do they give voters information (at least intheir ﬁrst round) about service benchmarks,except to the extent that the agencies them-selves have established service standards(repeat report cards do provide implicit bench-marks from the previous report card).So it canbe hard for voters to assess,on the basis ofonereport card,whether the results justify votingagainst the incumbents at the next election.Report cards seem to have had a moredirect inﬂuence on the heads and senior man-agers ofthe municipal and utility agenciesresponsible for services,as in Bangalore.Thehigh visibility ofreport cards in the press andcivic forums turns them into league tables ofthe efﬁcacy ofmunicipal agencies.The repu-tational competition arising from the reportcards is enhanced by joint agency meetings onthe report cards attended by prominent socialand political leaders and citizens.But report cards clearly also perform apolitical function.Politicians can ignore poorpublic services ifthey believe that voters can-not penalize them for poor performance.Or ifthey believe that a political challenger cannotcredibly promise voters better performance.An NGO conducting broad surveys and issu-ing report cards on public services changesthe equation.Now incumbent politicians are11_WDR_Ch05.qxd  8/14/03  8:40 AM  Page 88(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Citizens and politicians89confronted by an organized effort to improvepublic service delivery,which creates a latentpolitical force that is credible because there isno obvious personal gain to members oftheNGO.The information that the NGO gener-ates and disseminates is a political challenge,both because ofthe demonstrated underlyingability to mobilize citizens to answer a surveyand the power ofthat information in thehands ofinformed voters.Some implications for information strategiesThese examples show that pure informationstrategies work in fairly speciﬁc circum-stances.But many information strategies arenot designed around the speciﬁcs ofa partic-ular country or service.Information aboutbroad aggregates ofpublic sector perfor-mance—whether based on surveys,budgetstudies,or other methods—is less likely to beas politically relevant.Why? Because it doesnot provide voters with a sense ofhow theirrepresentatives in government have hurt orhelped them.Like report cards,such information canstill be useful ifvoters can benchmark theinformation or ifthe very collection oftheinformation implies some latent politicalorganization that could challenge incum-bents.But in many cases,the informationcollected is one-off—collected by donors andother foreign entities (posing no politicalthreat by deﬁnition),by local survey ﬁrms(with no speciﬁc interest in social services),or by civil society organizations (which caredeeply about public service performance butplay no electoral role).At the end ofthe day,these efforts tell citi-zens what they already know—that servicesare bad.They might tell them exactly how badand which services are worse than others—roughly the information citizens already had,but more quantiﬁed.What citizens do nothave,and what they need help in getting,isinformation about how bad their neighbor-hood’s services are relative to others’and whois responsible for the difference.273In thesecases outsiders can help in several ways:•Supporting civil society organizationsthat generate and use speciﬁc informa-tion about service delivery.•Supporting civil society organizations thatshow how to mobilize citizens and be acredible voice for public service provision.•Supporting mass media development.First,improving the media’s ability to askthe right questions (reporting on whethergovernment policy succeeds or fails,including how to identify the correctbenchmarks).Second,improving themedia’s credibility (independence fromprivate interests that beneﬁt from govern-ment largesse and from government inﬂu-ence,advertising revenue,or ownership).Reducing barriers to entry is key here.Third,improving interaction with civilsociety to generate information that revealspublic malfeasance or nonfeasance.274Decentralization to strengthen voice Decentralizing delivery responsibilities forpublic services is prominent on the reformagenda in many developing countries (seechapter 10).Bolivia,India,Indonesia,Nigeria,Pakistan,and South Africa—to name a few—are all part ofa worldwide movement todecentralize.A key objective,usually linked tothe political motivation for decentralization,isto strengthen citizen voice by bringing servicesand elected politicians closer to the client.Decentralization ofservice deliveryto local governmentsExperience with decentralization varies.InBolivia the creation ofrural local govern-ments has been associated with dramaticshifts in public allocations away from infra-structure and into the social sectors—and asharp fall in the geographic concentrationofpublic investments as they get moreevenly dispersed across regions.275But oth-ers have been less lucky,with increasedregional inequalities and the capture ofpublic resources by local elites.Since severalmajor decentralization reforms are justbeginning (Indonesia,Pakistan),there is atremendous opportunity to rigorously eval-uate the impact ofdifferent institutionaldesigns on the quality ofpublic goods.What does it take for political decentral-ization to improve universal,basic socialservices? Two conditions.First,voters mustbe more likely to use information about the11_WDR_Ch05.qxd  8/14/03  8:40 AM  Page 89(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

90WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004quality oflocal public goods in makingtheir voting decisions.Second,local politi-cal promises to voters must be more credi-ble than regional or national promises.In principle,the impact ofdecentralizationon informed voting and political credibilitycould go either way.On the one hand,votersmay make more use ofinformation aboutlocal public goods in their voting decisionsbecause such information is easier to come byand outcomes are more directly affected bylocal government actions.And political agentsmay have greater credibility because ofprox-imity to the community and reputationsdeveloped through social interaction over anextended period.On the other hand,localvoters may be apathetic about local electionsand have little or no information about theresource availability and capabilities oflocalgovernments.Social polarization may bemore intense because ofage-old differencesacross settled communities.With closer socialrelations between elected representatives andtheir clients,clientelist promises to a few vot-ers may be easier to make and fulﬁll.Managerial decentralization and political credibility There has also been a push for institutionaliz-ing greater autonomy ofdecisionmaking inschools,hospitals,and clinics—and encour-aging greater participation ofcitizensthrough parent-teacher associations andhealth committees.These institutional inter-ventions are also likely to address the credibil-ity ofelected politicians.Politicians located atthe center far from the communities whereservices are delivered cannot crediblypromise to improve service quality in suchtransaction-intensive services as basic healthand education.At most they can commit onlyto providing such veriﬁable elements as infra-structure,equipment,and salaries.When responsibility for delivering andmonitoring primary education is completelycentralized,the political incentives forimproving the quality ofschooling are weak.But ifmonitoring ofproviders is decentral-ized (to clients),voters need verify only thatpoliticians have made resources available forschools and clinics to decide whether toreward or punish them at election time,andpoliticians then can be more credible.Citizen voice in eightsizesWhether a political system is pro-poor orclientelist is difﬁcult to assess and address.This is obviously the case for outside actorssuch as donors,but also for those within acountry,who are naturally inﬂuenced by thehistory and traditions oftheir particular polit-ical system,such as parliamentary democracy.But the payoffs in service delivery for assessingwhether the environment is pro-poor orclientelist can be high.Even ifthe politics areclientelist,policy choices can be made that arelikely to yield better results than the mis-guided application ofpolicies that work wellonly in pro-poor environments.Such choices can be combined with con-siderations ofwhether preferences arehomogeneous or heterogeneous (a featureofthe relationship between clients andproviders,discussed in chapter 4),andwhether services are easy or hard to monitorby policymakers (and therefore whether con-tracts between policymakers and providerscan be written,as noted in chapter 3 and dis-cussed in more detail in chapter 6).Simplyput,the more people differ in their prefer-ences,the more the decisions about servicedelivery should be decentralized.The harderit is for policymakers to monitor,the moreclients need to be involved and the strongerclient power must be.Different combinations ofthese character-istics lead to different choices,some a better ﬁtthan others,so that while no one size ﬁts all,for illustrative purposes perhaps eight sizesmight (ﬁgure 5.4).None ofthese characteris-tics or choices can be precisely renderedbecause countries lie on a continuum.Butunderstanding them can help in thinkingabout the arrangements that are the mostlikely to make services work for poor people.Figure 5.4 also illustrates the broad servicedelivery arrangements and the implied policychoices that are appropriate under differentsettings.The biggest problem? The appropri-ate choice is often not made.In many countries,policymakers assumethat for transaction-intensive and hard-to-monitor services (for example,primary edu-cation),their country or region has pro-poorpolitics and little heterogeneity ofpreferences.So they chose central government provision11_WDR_Ch05.qxd  8/14/03  8:41 AM  Page 90(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Citizens and politicians91(option 2 in ﬁgure 5.4).But ifthe servicedelivery environment is actually based onclientelism,and preferences vary widely,thenconditions have been misread and servicesfail poor people.Decentralized provisionwith lots ofclient involvement at all levelsmay be called for in ways that create choiceand mimic the market ifservices are to work(option 8).In general,services can be made to workin clientelist settings by choosing arrange-ments that reduce the rents from servicedelivery that would otherwise be capturedthrough patronage and clientelism.Theseare the situations depicted in options 5through 8.The appropriate service arrange-ment for hard-to-monitor services such ascurative care or primary education mightthen be option 6 or 8 depending on whetherpreferences are homogenous or heteroge-neous.Ifinstitutional arrangements changeand a pro-poor service delivery environ-ment emerges,it should be possible to moveto the service arrangements described inoptions 1 through 4.But to the extent theydo not change,then trying to scale up withoptions 1 through 4 and make services workfor poor people may be wishful thinkingand a waste ofresources.Under either clientelist or pro-poor envi-ronments,having more and better informa-tion pays offin strengthening voice.Informa-tion about services that is speciﬁc,directlyrelated to voters’concerns,and framed in away that ensures political interest in address-ing service delivery concerns is likely to be themost effective.Information from impactassessments can show what works and why.Information about politicians can boost theirpolitical credibility,strengthen incentives toprovide universal public services,and avoidpolitically targeted goods and rent-seeking.Figure 5.4Eight sizes ﬁt allCentralized public financing with contracting out13Centralized government provision with regulatory oversight 245Decentralized, rule-based allocations, vouchers, private provision (because service is easy to monitor).Disseminate local information on provider performance to help monitoring.7Encourage altruistic providers (NGOs).

who reported participating in the govern-ment-organized village groups reportedbeing more likely to have spoken out aboutvillage problems and to have done so effec-tively.But this impact,by crowding out thevoice ofothers in the village,appears tohave been negative overall.The problems with local governancewere obvious in projects.The ﬁrst-genera-tion poverty alleviation programs—blockgrants to poor communities,under the IDT(Impres Desa Tertinggal)—used existingvillage structures and were judged to havehad very little impact,in quantity or qual-ity.279A study ofall projects in villages—including those initiated by villages on theirown(found that village-initiated projectswere much more likely to have sustainedbeneﬁts than government-initiated projects(ﬁgure 1).The next generation ofmore participa-tory projects—two rounds ofvillage infra-structure projects and water supply andsanitation projects—showed that greatercommunity engagement could have realpayoffs.Water projects designed to incor-porate participation had much lower failurerates than conventional projects.And thecosts ofthe village infrastructure projectswere 30 to 50 percent lower than costs inprojects using government construction.Pastoral scene—or chaotic messIndonesia in the New Order era ofSoeharto(1967–98) has been compared to a FrenchImpressionist painting:viewed from a dis-tance,a beautiful pastoral scene,but viewedclosely,a chaotic mess.The government launched top-down“blueprint”development programs in fertil-ity,health,schooling,and poverty reduc-tion—implemented by a reasonably func-tional and capable bureaucracy.Viewed inthe aggregate,the results were spectacular.Gross domestic product per capita grew atmore than 5 percent a year.Poverty fell fromnearly halfthe population in the 1970s to 11percent in 1997.Infant mortality fell,fertil-ity fell,and schooling rose dramatically.The 1979 law establishing village govern-ments was state ofthe art—on paper.Withthe goals of“decentralization”and “bottom-up”planning,the law established locallychosen village heads accountable to a villagecouncil.The budget planning process incor-porated village-level meetings to elicit bot-tom-up inputs into budget priorities.But the reality ofvillage leadership wasdifferent.Creating multifunctional villageadministrative structures imposed orderand uniformity at odds with existing socialstructures,ignoring organizations with spe-ciﬁc functions (water) and traditional lead-ership (adat).276Many villages had dynamicleaders,but many others had leaders chosenessentially by the regional (province or dis-trict) government,which had veto powerover candidates.277The village head wasaccountable to a council,but he also headedthe council and chose many ofits members.Most village heads were accountableupward—to regional governments—andnot to the villagers.The bottom-up plan-ning never really functioned:one analysis of770 village proposals found that,at most,3percent were included in district budgets.278Empirical results from a recent survey in48 rural villages suggest that the govern-ment-driven organizations did not makevillage governance more responsive.ThoseScaling up with simplicity and trustThe ﬁnancial and political crises thatbegan in 1997 opened a window foraction.Projects were desperately neededto help rural areas quickly.An improveddesign for community projects—based onthe lessons ofblock grants under the IDTand infrastructure investments under vil-lage infrastructure projects—was beingpiloted.It included open menus and moreemphasis on community participationand decisionmaking.The crisis also cre-ated an opportunity to act on issues oftransparency,local accountability,andcorruption.The new Kecamatan Development Pro-gram (KDP) provides block grants to eligi-ble subdistricts—or kecamatan,an admin-istrative unit that includes roughly 10 to20 villages and roughly 30,000 people,though its size varies enormously.Eachsubdistrict uses the funds to ﬁnance com-munity proposals from the villages forsmall-scale public goods (roads,wells,bridges) or economic activities.Makingthe decisions about which proposals tofund is a subdistrict forum,including vil-lage delegations.The KDP’s design was based on simplic-ity,participation,self-reliance,transparency,and trust.These principles may sound plati-tudinous,but they pushed the design enve-lope in several directions.•Simplicity meant that funds werereleased directly to communities,elimi-nating one role for regional (district andprovincial) governments.•Participation was encouraged,andlocally chosen village and subdistrictfacilitators helped groups to prepareproposals and encouraged the dissemi-nation ofinformation.•Self-reliance reversed the usual depen-dence ofvillagers on technical stafffromministries and government,permittingvillagers to hire the engineers and othertechnical help.Choice,participation,and transparency in Indonesian villagesA new generation ofcommunity development projects in Indonesia illustrates many ofthe key elements ofeffectiveservices.The projects transfer resources directly to local control,allowing a local decisionmaking body to choose amongproposals from community groups.The three principles are: choice,participation,and transparency.the Kecamatan Development Programspotlight

(and perhaps elsewhere) suggests the latter.But whether it will “work”in those places isstill an open question.Perhaps the principlescan be implemented with the design adaptedto local circumstances.Second,are large external agencies (likethe World Bank) really capable ofsupport-ing “big-time small development”projects?Perhaps yes,perhaps no.Some argue thatexternal actors have no mandate or exper-tise for engaging in local governance.Andpreserving the traditional exclusive link ofexternal agencies to formal public providerorganizations may make them incapable ofcontributing to the creation ofneeded localaccountabilities.This or that? Three strategic choicesCommunity-driven development projectssuch as the KDP raise three strategicchoices relevant to the design ofservicedelivery.Narrow or sharp targeting.Communityfunds,it is often alleged,are captured by“elites”and will not be well targeted to thepoor.The KDP shows that the poor do ben-eﬁt,but it is difﬁcult to reach the poorest ofthe poor or to change deeply held socialprejudices simply by project design(despite,for example,KDP mechanisms toenhance women’s voice).Few large pro-grams have shown greater ability to targetthe poor,and the very narrowly targetedprograms would not elicit engagement andsupport.Technical or participatory projects and ser-vice.Technical staffofthe government(and ofmany donor agencies) are leery of•Transparency meant that all ﬁnancialinformation was publicly available,anddetailed information about the use ofthe funds was available in each village insimple and easy-to-understand formats.•Trust made it possible to move fromcomplicated formal accounting systemsfor releasing funds to disbursement sys-tems that rely on minimal documenta-tion—but with built-in checks andoversight.The project has so far been an imple-mentation success,scaled up from 40 vil-lages in 1998 to more than 15,000 in 2002.It has moved into another cycle and beenreplicated in urban areas.Evaluationefforts,including an innovative attempt todirectly measure the impact on corruption,are examining whether the KDP hasimproved project performance.This is not to suggest that the KDP isfree from ﬂaws—it is a transitional projectin a transitional situation,embedded inexisting institutions.There have been prob-lems ofcorruption and poor technicalquality,and problems oflocal leaders “guid-ing”the participatory decisionmaking.Butthe KDP does give villagers the structuredmechanisms ofdecisionmaking and trans-parency.It also gives them recourse to forcethe issue ofbetter governance.Corrupt ofﬁ-cials have been sued.Money has beenrecovered.Decisions have been reversed.Two lingering issues:First,is the KDP anidiosyncratic product ofits particular timeand place—or a model that can be replicatedelsewhere? That versions ofit are beinglaunched in Afghanistan and the Philippinescommunity-driven project design becauseit can undermine technical quality.Giventhe choice ofa participatory bridge or anengineered bridge,most people would crossthe engineered bridge.The question is howto create a well-engineered bridge thatresponds to community needs.Other ser-vices try to balance community control andtechnical quality:participation in healthcare does not mean that medical sciencecan be replaced.Should KDP-like mecha-nisms be expanded with improved links totechnical providers? Or should technicalproviders be strengthened and the “partici-patory”role be channeled not into directcontrol and decisionmaking but into elect-ing local ofﬁcials?Local or regional governments.Regionalgovernments often complain that movingresources directly to communities under-mines their authority,slowing the capacitybuilding needed for formal governance anddemocracy.Proponents ofcommunitydevelopment respond that deep democracydepends on the kinds oftransparency,deci-sionmaking,open debate,and accountabil-ity that community projects build.Decen-tralizing decisions about budgets andprograms to the provincial level—whenpeople have not developed traditions andinstitutions ofcivic decisionmaking at thelocal level (or have had them suppressed)—is risky business.In a transitional environ-ment,periodic elections alone are unlikelyto be sufﬁcient for public accountability.The development ofnonelectoral mecha-nisms ofpublic accountability (trans-parency,legal recourses,direct participa-tion) is key.Spotlight on the Kecamatan Development Program9312_pgs 92-94_Ch05Spotlights.qxd 8/14/03 3:18 PM Page 93(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

larly monitor the health ofinfants andschoolchildren.From 1890 onwards,thehealth sector evolved through public-privatepartnerships,spurred on by pressure fromgrassroots and philanthropic organizations.As the state took on more responsibility fordelivering universal services,a process thatpicked up in the 1930s,it did not have to buildthe institutions from scratch:it could build oninstitutions already built,organized,andﬁnanced by private actors and civil society.Reforming schoolsFrom 1739,children were required toattend school from the age ofseven untilthey could read and undergo Lutheran con-ﬁrmation.The incentives to learn to readwere strong.No reading meant no conﬁr-mation,and no conﬁrmation meant nomarriage license,no land holding,no per-manent job,and no chance ofenlisting inthe armed forces.Nevertheless,the ruralpopulation resisted sending their childrento school,mainly because they found thecurriculum irrelevant for farming.As with health,formally trained teachersbecame the driving force behind using edu-cation to build the Norwegian nation.Teachers organized themselves in 1848 andadvocated inclusion ofeducation profes-sionals in policymaking bodies.The SchoolAct of1860 shifted responsibility for run-ning schools from the clergy to an electedschool board (whose head would still be apriest).As a result ofpopulist and agrarianpressure,local school councils were able toappoint teachers,determine their own“education plan,”and introduce New Norseas the language ofinstruction.But a grow-ing labor movement was demanding moreuniversal education,so that by 1889 a com-mon school law was passed and educationﬁnally moved from religious training togeneral learning and nation building.Norway:gradual change with top-down pressureIn 1860 the Norwegian national assemblypassed two laws—the Health Act and theSchool Act—the ﬁrst time the state tookresponsibility for the health and education ofits people.The Health Act,which establishedhealth commissions in every municipality,was promoted by the country’s social elite toimprove the welfare ofNorway’s farming andpeasant communities so that the countrycould compete with the more advancednations ofEurope.The elite saw educatingpoor rural households in personal and envi-ronmental hygiene as a key to this project,and the health commissions were chargedwith this task.Interestingly,members ofthemedical profession,which up to that pointhad a somewhat lower status than other pro-fessions (lawyers,priests,and the military),saw themselves as the natural leaders ofthecampaign.According to one doctor,appoint-ing a lawyer to head the campaign (some-thing that was being contemplated) “woulddo nothing to further the cause.”280But the health commissions faced sig-niﬁcant difﬁculties in getting their jobdone.In addition to the facts that doctorswere not trained in public health and theirwork was poorly paid,the cultural dividebetween the urban elites and rural farmerswas an obstacle.For instance,although fer-tilizer was a scarce commodity,the doctorswere trying to get rid ofthe compost heapsnear people’s houses because ofthe “rotten”air that people were obliged to breathe.Meanwhile,many ofthe services werebeing delivered by grassroots organizations.Founded in 1896,the Norwegian Women’sPublic Health Association was running 14sanatoria for patients with tuberculosis by1920.The Association also advocated forgreater public intervention in health,gettingthe authorities to open public baths and regu-Estonia:starting over,with fewresourcesAt re-independence in 1991,Estonia wantedto move away from its inherited systems tomodern Western European approaches thatrested on progressive governmental,eco-nomic,and social reforms—partly for accep-tance into the European Union.The newstate had to quickly establish the mechanismsofa modern welfare system.But there was lit-tle time to establish the system’s legitimacy.The ﬁrst priority in 1991 was servicesbased on Estonian language and culture,critical for national identity.Then came theurgent need to improve efﬁciency andequity.But economic difﬁculties limited theresources for reform.The health care system had to be com-pletely reorganized.Unlike the situation inNorway,the administrative,legislative,andregulatory powers in Estonia were all in oneplace:the Ministry ofHealth.With littletransparency and control,corruption ﬂour-ished.To address the problem,the old state-funded system was replaced by healthinsurance,which facilitated transparencyand a steady stream ofﬁnance.A majorchallenge has been to convey the logic andlong-term advantages ofthe new system.People suddenly had to pay for health carethat used to be free.Drugs were sold atEuropean

95Educated children.Good health.Clean,reli-able,and convenient water.Safe neighbor-hoods.Lighted homes.That is what citi-zens,poor and rich,want from services.Ifpolicymakers take responsibility for deliver-ing services,they must also care about theseoutcomes and be sure that servicesproviders care about them,too.Chapter 5discussed the ﬁrst challenge:inducing poli-cymakers to reﬂect the interests ofpoorpeople.This chapter takes up the second:inducing providers to achieve the outcomesofinterest to poor people.How? By choos-ing appropriate providers.By aligningincentives with those outcomes.And byensuring that policymakers do at least aswell as the clients themselves in creatingthose incentives.Compacts,management,and the“long route”of accountabilityThe “compact”introduced in chapter 3 iscomposed ofrelationships ofaccountabilitynecessary for increasing the power ofincen-tives for good performance (ﬁgure 6.1).Instructions to provider organizations mustbe clear and backed with sufﬁcient resourcesfor adequate and regular compensation.Good information on the actions ofproviders and the outcomes ofthose actionsmust get to the policymaker.And remunera-tion must be tied as closely to these outcomesas possible.Accountability is improved by:•Clarifying responsibilities—by separat-ing the role ofpolicymaker,accountableto poor citizens,from that ofproviderorganizations,accountable to policy-makers.•Choosing the appropriate provider—civil servants,autonomous public agen-cies,NGOs,or private contractors.Com-petition can often help in this choice.•Providing good information—an essen-tial step.Just monitoring the performanceofcontracts requires more and bettermeasures.Keeping an eye on the prize ofbetter outcomes also requires more regu-lar measurement.It also requires ﬁndingout what works by rigorously evaluatingprograms and their effects.These steps are neither easy nor straight-forward.Political pressures often make itimpossible for policymakers to claim inde-pendence from the performance ofserviceproviders.Compacts for the kind ofservicesdiscussed here cannot be complete or haveperfectly measured outcomes.Findingenough staff,regardless oftheir preciseemployment agreements,is a real challengefor many developing countries because ofinternational migration and,for Sub-SaharanAfrica,HIV/AIDS.And ﬁnding out whatworks—determining the link between poli-cies and inputs and outcomes—is difﬁcult,not just for technical reasons.Governments,donors,and provider organizations fre-Policymakers and providers6chapterFigure 6.1Compact and management in the service delivery frameworkCompactThe statePoliticiansPolicymakersLongrouteofaccountabilityShortrouteProvidersFrontlineOrganizationsManagementServices13_WDR_Ch06.qxd  8/14/03  9:07 AM  Page 95(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Policymakers and providers97had been raised in the city.283It is only nat-ural for them to want the same for their chil-dren.And it is naïve to simply say “pay themmore.”Doctors in Indonesia would requiremultiples ofcurrent pay levels to live in WestPapua.284And giving providers too much dis-cretion over where they serve may hurt thepoor,as in rural schools in Zambia (box 6.2).Even when people accept jobs in poorareas,their absenteeism is often astonishing(see tables 1.2 and 1.3 in chapter 1).The rea-sons vary,but alternative earning opportu-nities are a major one for professions witheasily marketable skills.285This applies todoctors and other medical personnel and toteachers offering independent tutoring.Again,the day-to-day imperatives for peopleto make a living run counter to increasingservices to poor people.This is particularlytrue where civil service pay is much lessthan private sector pay for the same skills.Even when people are on the job,theirperformance can compromise the outcomesfor poor people.The lack ofconscientious-ness,the mistreatment ofstudents andpatients,and the loss ofskills with time(chapter 1)—all can be attributed to a com-bination ofthe failure ofincentives and aservice ethos.Salaried workers with noopportunity to advance and no fear ofpun-ishment have little incentive to perform well.Chapter 4 argued that discourtesy dependedon incentives,not training.Ifincome doesnot come from clients,the policymaker musthold providers accountable,particularly inmonitoring and rewarding good behavior.Corruption—unauthorized private gainfrom public resources—is common in manyservices and also attributable to competingincentives.In Eastern Europe under-the-tablepayments to public servants and general cor-ruption undermine the legitimacy ofall gov-ernment services.They are particularly costlyto poor people (box 6.3).Pharmaceuticalmismanagement is everywhere:thefts frompublic stores supply much ofthe private mar-ket in Côte d’Ivoire,India,Jordan,Thailand,and Zambia.Corruption responds to mone-tary incentives,but it also requires a lack ofinformation on hidden activities and aninability to impose sanctions.As CaptainShotover in George Bernard Shaw’s Heart-break Houseput it,“Give me deeper darkness.Money is not made in the light.”Open infor-mation can reduce both the incidence ofcor-ruption and its corrosiveness.286Community pressure can also subvertthe incentives to fulﬁll the primary respon-sibilities ofpublic providers.In many placesthe public servant is a permanent memberofthe community,facing substantial socialpressures to bend rules to the beneﬁt oflocal preferences.Sometimes this is good—it shows the ﬂexibility to respond to localneeds.But for some services,particularlythose with punitive characteristics,it cancompromise the core duties ofthe provider.For example,forestry agents who are part ofa community may be reluctant to reportillegal logging by their neighbors.287A formofcommunity pressure particularly harm-ful to the poor is the capture ofservices bylocal elites.In Northern Ghana young,inex-perienced,and poorly paid facilitators forparticipatory projects found such pressure amajor impediment.288Rural schools in Zambia obtain resources incash and in kind (personnel).Cash transfersallocated by strict rules of per capita fundingare distinctly progressive.Rural areas give sig-niﬁcantly higher discretionary cash allocationsto rich schools.Per-pupil teacher compensa-tion increases with the wealth of childrenattending the school,reﬂecting higher stafﬁngratios and the gravitation of senior staff toricher areas.Source:Das and others (2003).BOX 6.2Provider discretioncan hurt the poorFunding of rural primary schools in Zambiafrom different sources0Poorest23Wealth by fifths4Richest15105252030Funding per student (kwacha, thousands)DiscretionaryAccordingto strictrulesStaffremuneration13_WDR_Ch06.qxd  8/14/03  9:08 AM  Page 97(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

98WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Many,and usually most,providers in thepublic sector are dedicated people whoseinterests are largely compatible with the pub-lic good.But their own needs oflooking aftera family,ensuring their well being,havingfriendly relations with neighbors—all pre-vent them from providing sufﬁcient servicesto beneﬁt poor people.Ifthe scale ofopera-tions needs to be increased to reach the poor,even more incentives need to be changed atthe margin,whether monetary or not.289Increasing accountability:separating the policymaker from the providerThe many incentives that providers face blurthe focus on outcomes.Making a clear sepa-ration between the role ofthe policymakerand the provider organization is essential foraligning the incentives for the provider withthe ﬁnal outcomes that policymakers wantfor citizens.Who is the policymaker,and whois the provider organization? The policy-maker is the person directly accountable tothe citizenry,preferably the poorer citizenry.And the provider organization is responsiblefor delivering services.In many cases,the pol-icymaker is the legislature or a central min-istry,the provider organization a line min-istry.So many ofthe activities ofthe head ofthe “provider organization”will look like pol-icymaking.But these are “internal policies”ofthe organization to achieve the overall goalsfocused on here.(The literature on publicmanagement explicitly cautions against sepa-rating290policymaking from implementa-tion,but that literature is concerned withmanagement within the “provider organiza-tion”and not the separation proposed here.)Clear separation lends itselfto much sim-pler and less ambiguous accountability forthe provider organization.When the policy-maker is the provider organization,day-to-day pressures ofmanagement compromiseattention to outcomes on the ground.Takethe desire to ﬁnd and ﬁx problems (see thespotlight on Johannesburg).When the poli-cymaker takes a separate role from theprovider,it is easier to say “I don’t care whatyour problem is,just tell me the vaccinationrates.Or the test scores.Or crime rates.”When roles are mixed,bureaucracies becomeinsular and tend to hide mistakes.To gain access to health,education,and the justice system in Kazakhstan,poor people pay bribes simply toreceive services they are entitled to (and to avoid “problems”getting them) while richer people pay to speedup service.In Romania,the poor pay substantially higher fractions of income in bribes.BOX 6.3Bribery hurts the poor Note:Numbers add to more than 100 percent due to multiple responses.Source:Anderson,Kaufmann,and Recanatini (2003).020406080100120140OtherTo avoidproblemsTo receivebenefitsSpeedPoorestthirdMiddlethirdRichestthirdPercent responses per income group024681012PoorestthirdMiddlethirdRichestthirdPercentKazakhstan: reasons for paying bribesto health, education, and justice systemsRomania: Percent of income paid in bribes(of those paying bribes)13_WDR_Ch06.qxd  8/14/03  9:08 AM  Page 98(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Policymakers and providers99Is this separation really necessary? Is itachieved in rich countries? Education,forexample,is frequently administered throughcentral ministries,which employ all teachersdirectly with little monitoring from centralstaffagencies (such as ﬁnance).Perhaps sepa-ration is not necessary for successful services.But rich countries beneﬁt from a longevolution ofthe relationships between thestate and frontline providers.Almost all ser-vices provided directly to individuals in thenow-rich countries were originally providedprivately.They were eventually absorbed orconsolidated by a state institution that hadbeen separate from the existing providerorganizations.The state began as an indepen-dent outside monitor and regulator ofprivateactivities.It largely retained that indepen-dence as a monitor after the same activitiesbecame public (box 6.4).For the developing world the desire forrapid expansion ofpublic ﬁnancing and pro-vision short-circuits this historical develop-ment.Both the monitoring and the provisionare taking place simultaneously.This is notnecessarily a bad thing—the poor might oth-erwise have to wait much longer for servicesto reach them.But it does show that the cur-rent institutional features ofrich countriesmay not transfer directly to poor countrieswithout the establishment ofa complemen-tary regulatory structure,a structure that mayneed to be established beforehand.Withoutthis structure progress may be slow—possi-bly slower than ifa not-for-proﬁt or privatesector were allowed to develop and laterbrought under the supervisory wing ofthegovernment.Separating the policymaker from theprovider organization also helps to increasethe accountability ofproviders.But ifthe poli-cymaker knows what services to deliver,whycan’t providers just be given instructions—in acontract—to do them? That is,why can’t out-puts just be speciﬁed and paid for accordingly?Limits to accountabilityAll public services face three problems thatmake this solution impossible:providersface multiple principals,undertake multipletasks,and produce outcomes that are hardto observe and hard to attribute to theiractions.291Multiple principalsThe instructions ofthe policymaker toproviders are not the only ones that count.Public servants have to serve many masters.Education providers are under pressurefrom parents ofpoor children (with thepolicymaker representing them),parents ofchildren other than the poor,teachers’unions,potential employers,various groupsin society that want (or don’t want) particu-lar items on the curriculum,and others.Power and water providers are under pres-sure from different segments ofthe marketto cross-subsidize them,from producers tobuy speciﬁc types ofequipment,from peo-ple who want more extensive connections,and from others who want more reliable,continuous operation.The day-to-day pres-sure oflocal demand for health care cancompromise efforts in disease preventionand other public health activities that arenot demand-driven.292Whom is a providerto listen to?Although the state pays for health care inmost Organisation for Economic Co-opera-tion and Development (OECD) countries,private practitioners still provide it (excep-tions on the ﬁnance side include the UnitedStates;exceptions on the provision side,theUnited Kingdom).The state carries out theinsurance function in these countries butnot the services.It is the insurance marketthat is hampered by severe market failure.In Germany,the current system is a consoli-dation,begun under Bismarck in 1883,of asystem of guild-based insurance schemes.For most OECD countries,the currentsystem of public ownership or controldates from a time after World War II whenthey had incomes at least as high as theupper-middle-income countries today.Before these programs were brought underpublic management,the state already hadregulatory powers over the medical profes-sion.The timing was fortuitous since it wasonly in the 20th century that technicalchanges in medicine made publicoversight essential.Universal public education is also fairlyrecent.It came out of a conﬂict betweenchurch and state.In the period of expansionof public facilities,the main mechanism wasincorporating private schools into the pub-lic network after a system of managing indi-vidual schools had already developed.Even the core networked services ofwater,electricity,gas,and railways—servicesnow thought of as natural monopolies—began as purely private activities.In theUnited Kingdom early water systems weresometimes developed with duplicate pipeslaid by competing ﬁrms.Only after cover-age was substantial were theserationalized—and then for reasons of pub-lic health rather than duplication.Germanrailways also began with duplicate lines.Inother cases,companies worked out agree-ments that divided markets without theduplication experienced in the railway mar-kets in the United States and England—forexample,bus systems in many large urbanareas and German natural gas transport.These were then brought under a regula-tory regime but only after reaching quitehigh service penetration.In each of these cases the independentregulatory capacity of the policymaker pre-ceded the incorporation of privateproviders into a public system.Source:Klein and Roger (1994).BOX 6.4Learning to regulate13_WDR_Ch06.qxd  8/14/03  9:09 AM  Page 99(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

100WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Multiple tasksPersonnel in health clinics are supposed toprovide curative care to people who come tothem.They are also to provide immuniza-tions,health education,and other preventivemeasures to everyone,whether they come inon their own or not.And they are to keepstatistics,attend training sessions and meet-ings,and do inspections ofwater and food.Police ofﬁcers have to deal with everyonefrom lost children to dangerous criminals.They are,at various times,investigators ofcrimes,social workers intervening in neigh-borhood and family disputes,and dissemi-nators ofinformation.This diffusion natu-rally blunts the precision ofincentives.Measuring and attributingoutcomesThe most difﬁcult problems,particularly forthe social sectors,are the dual problems ofmeasuring outcomes and attributing theseoutcomes to the actions ofproviders.Testscores may adequately reﬂect certain educa-tional goals,but abstract thinking and socialadaptability are not so easily measured.Thealleviation ofpain is a subjective judgmentofthe patient.Many outcomes,even whenobservable to the patient and the doctor,arenot “contractible”in the sense that,ifa dis-pute arises,compliance can be proved to ajudge or other mediator.And attributingimpacts to provider actions is difﬁcult inalmost all social services.These problems make it impossible to haveperformance contracts that make payments toindividual frontline providers depend on out-comes.All contracts will necessarily beincomplete,requiring at least some paymentofwages independent ofoutputs.When theactions ofthe provider are speciﬁed in greatdetail,the results are often less than optimalbecause ofinﬂexible response to local varia-tion.The impossibility ofspecifying suchrules ahead oftime is illustrated by “work-to-rule”strikes,in which strikers bring an activityto a “grinding halt”by following rules entirelyto the letter (box 6.5).The balance betweencontrol and ﬂexibility is not easily struck.Further,since the provider does manythings,some or all ofthem hard to observe bythe policymaker,there is the ever-present riskthat payments for measured outcomes willdisplace hard-to-measure tasks (box 6.6).This risk has been discussed in the educationliterature as “teaching to the test.”Whenteacher compensation (pay or promotionprospect) is measured by students’perfor-mance on a standard test,there will be a ten-dency to downplay those aspects ofpedagogynot covered by the test and to concentrate onthose that are.In Kenya teachers manipulatedtest scores by offering tutoring sessions aimedspeciﬁcally at these tests.There was noimprovement in other indicators ofquality,such as homework assignments,teacherabsences,or teaching methods.293Several industrial countries,in reformingthe civil service or other providers ofpublicservices,have tried to use performance con-tracts.The evidence ofsuccess is mixed:294many problems are tied to the dependence ofthe policymaker on information the agencyprovides—a problem closely related to theregulation ofprivate ﬁrms.Some informa-tion used for performance contracts can beeasily falsiﬁed or,less pejoratively,presentedin too favorable a light.For example,wheneducation reforms were instituted in theUnited Kingdom,truancies were redeﬁned asexcused absences.295Overcoming the limitsSeparating policymakers from provider orga-nizations can help sharpen incentives to helppoor people.Assigning policymakers the roleofdevising a compact for the provider orga-nization and assigning provider organiza-tions the responsibility ofmanagement can“Anyone who has worked in a formal orga-nization—even a small one strictlygoverned by detailed rules—knows thathandbooks and written guidelines failutterly in explaining how the institutiongoes about its work.Accounting for itssmooth operation are nearly endless andshifting sets of implicit understandings,tacit coordinations,and practical mutuali-ties that could never be successfullycaptured in a written code.This ubiquitoussocial fact is useful to employees and laborunions.The premise behind what aretellingly called work-to-rule strikes is a casein point.When Parisian taxi drivers want topress a point on the municipal authoritiesabout regulations or fees,they sometimeslaunch a work-to-rule strike.It consistsmerely in following meticulously all the reg-ulations in the Code routier and therebybringing trafﬁc throughout central Paris to agrinding halt.The drivers thus take tacticaladvantage of the fact that the circulation oftrafﬁc is possible only because drivers havemastered a set of practices that haveevolved outside,and often in contravention,of the formal rules.”Source:Scott (1998).BOX 6.5Be careful what you wish for—part 113_WDR_Ch06.qxd  8/14/03  9:09 AM  Page 100(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Policymakers and providers101enable the use ofhigher-powered incentivesto align the interests ofthe frontline providerwith those ofthe policymaker representingthe poor,for the following three reasons.First,policymakers,balancing political pres-sures,can help insulate providers from theproblem ofsatisfying masters with conﬂict-ing aims and offer unambiguous instruc-tions.Second,provider organizations canface performance-based payments whenindividuals cannot.Third,managers oftheprovider organizations,ifthey have ﬂexibilityover operational decisions,can supervise staffand choose the appropriate form ofremu-neration that best reﬂects local conditions.Insulating providers from politicsThat providers have to satisfy many mastersreﬂects the inability ofgovernment to insu-late them from political pressures.While pol-icymakers for education need to addressconcerns ofpotential employers,teachers’unions,or interest groups who want to inﬂu-ence curricula,there is no reason why thisshould affect day-to-day activities in aschool,or indeed any organization offront-line providers.Ifthe policymaking functioncan be separated from the provider organiza-tion,the policymaker can handle the politicsofthe overall objectives ofeducation whilethe provider can be given more preciseinstructions and be held accountable to thepolicymaker.Poor people might legitimatelydelegate to policymakers curriculum devel-opment as well as the responsibility to bal-ance their interests with those ofunions.Organizations and individualsIndividual providers will not accept perfor-mance contracts that leave them exposed toexcessive risk.But the variability ofaggregateperformance over all providers in an organi-zation—say,those dealing with infant mor-tality for a district—is very much smaller,which provides a way ofsharing the risk.While a single doctor may not be able toabsorb the risk to income ofthe bad luck ofany particular patient,a district health boardwould.Teams—schools,school districts,health boards,city police departments—canbe the recipients ofperformance-basedincentives where teachers,nurses,and police-men cannot (see spotlight on Costa Rica andCuba).What can be considered measurablevaries by the size ofthe organization—largerones being easier to hold to account.The problem ofmultiple tasks is partly aproblem ofeconomies ofscale as well.Sometasks can be divided into groups ofcomple-mentary activities—all immunizations as agroup,say,or all health education activitiesbased on home visits (chapter 8).Then afairly homogeneous organization can becharged with the responsibility to carry out asimpler set oftasks,with clear standards ofaccountability.Reform in Johannesburg,South Africa(see spotlight),was in large part a reevalua-tion ofthe appropriate set ofservices to begrouped together to deliver speciﬁed outputs.Departments were reorganized so that theiroutputs were clearly identiﬁable and veriﬁ-able,with the department’s CEO able toretain any savings over contract expenditures.At one extreme,commercial enterprises—such as the athletics stadium,the airport,andmetro gas—were simply sold to the privatesector and directly faced the forces ofthemarket,where payment is very much depen-dent on outcomes.296Management ﬂexibilityEach ofthese potential effects depends onmanagers in provider organizations having theﬂexibility and authority to design the incen-tives for the frontline providers in their organi-zations.This allows them to adapt to local (orsectoral) variation to see whether performancepay or salaries with supervision works better.Flexibility for the manager is essential,a majorpart of“institutional capacity.”Managers musthave control over the pay scheme or the sanc-tions for poor performance.Salaried systems work as long as there isthe ability either to ﬁre or to grant raises onThe Sears Corporation lost a $48,000,000class action suit in which its automobilerepair department was accused of deliber-ately sabotaging customers’vehicles.Thecorporation was held responsible,havinginstructed its employees that bonuseswould be paid to those branches with themost repeat business.That the intention ofthe instruction was to encourage courteousbehavior did not impress the court.Source:Sears Automotive Center ConsumerLitigation,Action No.C-92-2227,U.S.DistrictCourt,San Francisco.BOX 6.6Be careful what you wish for—part 213_WDR_Ch06.qxd  8/14/03  9:10 AM  Page 101(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

102WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004the basis ofmerit.The worst case is whensalaried workers face neither sanctions forpoor performance nor increased pay or pres-tige for good performance.Civil servants inSingapore enjoy high salaries and a lot ofprestige,but also work under a credible threatofbeing ﬁred.A problem with some oftherecent reforms in developed countries insti-tuting contractual relations with providers isthat they undermine the public service ethos.(“IfI am to be treated as a mercenary,I mightas well act like one.”) Increased accountabilitythrough monetary incentives was partly off-set by reduced accountability through inter-nal motivation.297Developing countries thathave instilled this sense ofduty should bewary ofcompromising it.But they should bebrutally honest with themselves beforedeclaring this a major consideration.Sometimes performance pay is appropri-ate and necessary but should be a matter forlocal experimentation.Several health inter-ventions have beneﬁted greatly by introduc-ing performance-based incentives for workers(box 6.7).In other contexts,those incentivesare precisely what is needed to obtain particu-lar desired results.In the British NationalHealth Service most general practitioner payis determined on the basis ofcapitation pay-ments—for how many people sign up withthe doctor.But it is supplemented by speciﬁcadditional payments for the provision ofimmunizations to counter any incentive toskimp on this priority service.New providers for expanding supplyWhere will the providers ofservices comefrom? One possibility is that competition forcompacts will attract more provider organi-zations.The beneﬁts from competition arereduced costs,greater effort,and betterinformation—even when public provision isthe dominant form,as long as public andother provider organizations are treatedeven-handedly.Three types ofcompetitionare relevant for services:competition in themarket,competition for the market,andbenchmarking.Competition.Competition inthe marketsimply means allowing private providers.Forhealth and education,such providers areeverywhere,and in many places larger play-ers than the government (chapter 4).Recenttechnological advances have made it possibleto open services formerly believed to be nat-ural monopolies to competition.Indepen-dent power producers,for example,can beused to sell electricity to a larger grid.Thecost ofallowing free entry into naturalmonopolies is the risk ofinefﬁcient duplica-tion ofinvestments.Efﬁcient regulation isnecessary but complicated.Ifpolitical andadministrative limitations on the indepen-dence and effectiveness ofregulators aresevere,allowing the duplication may be thelesser oftwo evils.298The impact ofcompetition can go bothways:the presence ofthe public sector canimpose indirect discipline on the private sec-tor,both on prices and on quality.In Malaysiaa credible public health system has kept pricerises modest in the private sector.299The ben-eﬁts ofpublic provision extend beyond thenumbers ofpatients treated publicly.Simi-larly,the presence ofqualiﬁed medical per-sonnel can force quality improvements inprivate markets.300Ifnatural monopolies exist,there can becompetition forthe market.Potential com-petitors bid for concessions—compacts—toprovide the service.Much government pro-The Bangladesh Rural Advancement Com-mittee (BRAC),one of the largest NGOs inBangladesh,paid workers to teach mothershow to use oral rehydration therapy for chil-dren with diarrhea.Independent of theproviders,bonuses were paid on the basisof surveys of random samples of 5–10 per-cent of the mothers.The greater the num-ber of women who could explain how tomake and use the rehydration solution,thehigher the payment.More than half of totalcompensation was paid as a bonus.The mothers’knowledge increased dra-matically—to 65 percent of those taughttwo years after the training.Most important,the teaching techniques that the workersused changed from standard lectures tomore hands-on demonstrations.Ratherthan have the right teaching techniquespeciﬁed for them from on high,workersdeveloped the best way to achieve themeasured outcome—ﬁnding out for them-selves what worked in their context.In Haiti,NGOs were given performance-based contracts,directly from the U.S.Agency for International Development,toprovide preventive health care servicessuch as immunizations,health education,prenatal care,and family planning.Again,anindependent monitor,l’Institut Haitien del’Enfance,a local survey research ﬁrm,wasused to verify performance.Immunizationrates increased dramatically along with sev-eral other outputs.Interestingly,some of theNGOs experimented with performance paythemselves but found lower morale andperformance when workers (low paid them-selves) faced such risky incomes.The NGOs,while satisﬁed with the high-poweredincentives by which they were paid,foundbetter ways to pay frontline providers inaccordance with local circumstances.Sources:Chowdhury (2001) and Eichler,Auxilia,and Pollock (2001).BOX 6.7Incentive pay works for speciﬁc healthinterventions13_WDR_Ch06.qxd  8/14/03  9:10 AM  Page 102(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Policymakers and providers103curement in richer countries uses this model.It requires the ability to let,monitor,andenforce the explicit contracts for the winner.Recent innovations in the state ofMadhyaPradesh in India allow NGOs to compete forconcessions to primary schools.Payments areconditional on improved test scores based onindependent measurement.One advantagethe developing world has over earlier experi-ence in Europe is that it has ﬁrms with goodreputations and experience in the supply ofwater,power,and transport—and interna-tional courts for dispute resolution.301Butthe recent experience ofEnron in India’sMaharashtra State provides a reality check onover-enthusiasm for these beneﬁts.Benchmarkor yardstick competition canbe used when different providers are givenparts ofa larger system to run.Even when thepublic sector is the main provider ofservices,information from varying experiences can bevaluable.Information on costs ofproductionmay be much cheaper to obtain by simpleobservation ofone’s own activities than fromdetailed technology assessments.Informa-tion on consumer preferences may becheaper to obtain by counting customersthan by conducting market research.For road construction in Johannesburg,anexplicit contract was made between the citymanager and an autonomous public agency,the Johannesburg Road Agency,to build agiven number ofkilometers ofroad for anegotiated price.The basis ofthe negotiationwas the set ofhistorical costs in the publicagencies.The manager ofthe autonomousagency then used both the public worksdepartment and private sector ﬁrms as con-tractors.Competition among the contractorsdetermined subsequent allocations offunds.Even though it was not possible to ﬁre person-nel from the public agency,competition forfunds ensured that the public agency wouldmatch the efﬁciency ofthe private ﬁrms(which it did for many contracts).Therecould be a gradual shift to private provision,but only on the basis ofproven performance.Limits to competition and the search forsuppliers.For contracts that cannot becomplete,aspects ofdelivery outside the con-tract will remain a matter oftrust.For theprovision ofservices to poor people,this trustis particularly important because there arefewer “perks”for working in poor areas—pri-vate earnings after working hours (for med-ical personnel and teachers) are lower,livingconditions harsher.In the long run,a public sector with a strongethos ofpublic service will be needed.In manyplaces it already exists.It does no good to pre-tend,however,that expanding the civil serviceunder current recruitment and incentiveregimes will attract those best suited to servingpoor people.In Nepal an anthropologicalstudy showed that health staff’s view oftheirjobs often differed from the ofﬁcial view.302Many staffsaw the health program solely as asource ofemployment.A broader set ofpoten-tial providers is needed to accept the compacts.NGOs—so much a part ofthe Africanscene and active in several other countries,such as Bangladesh—are possible candidates.They are a varied group.Many are not directlyinvolved in service provision,and many com-bine service with advocacy.Those that provideservices often have a great deal ofautonomy,choosing where and how to deliver services.Tothat extent,they might be treated the same asthe rest ofthe private sector in planning publicservices.The government should not be in thebusiness ofdisplacing them.NGOs that have a tradition ofaltruisticservice can frequently be lower-cost produc-ers.In a recent study,religious NGOs provid-ing health care in Uganda were found to offerhigher-quality service than their public sectorcounterparts.They also paid lower wages thanthe private sector and very much lower thanthe public sector.Unlike the private sector,they were more likely to provide public healthservices (as opposed to simply medical care)and to charge less.And they used an extra cashgrant to lower fees and provide more services,such as laboratory tests,whereas the publicsector used the grant to increase pay.303NGOs are often,though not always,betterable to reach poor people.A substantiallyhigher fraction ofthe clientele ofNGOs pro-viding health care in Zambia comes frompoorer segments ofsociety than does the clien-tele ofgovernment facilities or privateproviders.304But even they have a hard timereaching the very poorest.NGOs may also bein a better position,with their greater ﬂexibilityand their internal motivation,to bring services13_WDR_Ch06.qxd  8/14/03  9:11 AM  Page 103(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

104WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004to otherwise excluded groups (box 6.8).Andsmaller organizations can reach niche popu-lations that a broad-based bureaucracy mayﬁnd hard to serve.In combating AIDS,community outreachoften needs to deal with prostitutes,drug users,and very sick,stigmatized people.The samedifﬁculties in assigning public personnel toremote areas have been found in reaching thesesubgroups.In Brazil,however,NGOs compet-ing for government funds were able to reachhigh-risk segments ofsociety that usually avoidpublic programs (such as prostitutes),to dis-tribute 2.6 million contraceptives,and to take11,000 hotline calls.The relative independenceofNGOs from the core ofthe public servicemay make it easier for them to fund their activ-ities from public resources by granting policy-makers an extra layer ofdeniability.The altruistic motives ofpeople workingin NGOs can overcome the incompleteness ofcontracts.NGO providers are generally lesslikely than for-proﬁt providers to exploit thedifﬁculties ofmonitoring contract terms fortheir own beneﬁt.Their altruism may partlyoutweigh a reluctance to locate in difﬁcult,remote,rural areas that are hard to staffwithcivil servants.This possibility has led one ana-lyst,thinking ofAfrica,to conclude that ser-vices to poor people may,for the time being,have to be left to such groups,particularly thechurch.305Once again,patience is called for.Donorenthusiasm has led to a massive proliferation ofNGOs,many ofthem not at all motivated byaltruism.306Indeed,many appear to be run byformer civil servants who have lost their jobs asa result ofthe downsizing ofpublic sectors butwho know how to approach donors and gov-ernment contracting agencies.A rapid expan-sion ofcontracts for NGOs will tend to attractthe same people,and their motives may beexactly the same as those ofa for-proﬁt ﬁrm—requiring the same monitoring and care in con-tract enforcement.NGOs with a track record ofgood performance and dedication to poor peo-ple are potentially very important elements ofastrategy to extend services to the neediest peo-ple.But establishing a track record,by its verynature,does not happen as fast as donors wouldlike.The development oftrust takes time.New challenges to supply.Although theremay be ways to extend the supply ofprovidersby promoting competition and efﬁcient con-tracting with NGOs and the private sector,tworecent trends in developing countries are mak-ing skilled professionals scarcer,or moreexpensive.First,professionals—doctors,teach-ers,and engineers—are increasingly part ofintegrated global markets and recruitmentneeds to compete at world wage rates.And it isnot only to the rich countries that staffare emi-grating.Botswana,for example,has beenrecruiting teachers from other,poorer English-speaking countries.The global market for ser-vices is changing rapidly due to internationalagreements and could lead to new sources ofsupply.Whether this turns out to help or hin-der services in developing countries remains tobe seen (see box 6.9).Second,HIV/AIDS,particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa,has dealt a major blow to theranks ofservice providers.More teachers diedofAIDS in Malawi in 2000 than entered theprofession (see box 1.2).Botswana’s search forteachers,originally to meet a burgeoningdemand for education,was given greaterurgency by the country’s AIDS problem.Andjust as demands for health service workers areincreasing,their supply is being cut.When a factor ofproduction becomesscarcer,its use must be conserved—in one oftwo ways.First,techniques that are less skill-intensive can be chosen.Distance learning,while not ideal for pedagogical purposes,mayneed to be explored to save scarce teachingtime.Similarly,it may be appropriate to useOne advantage that NGOs may have overthe public sector is the freedom from ﬁxedcivil service rules or standard operating pro-cedures.In some ways this reduces account-ability,but it can avoid unnecessaryconstraints.A social worker in a family protection pro-gram calls on a family threatened with hav-ing a child removed for neglect.She’sgreeted by the mother,who says “If there isone thing I don’t need in my life right now,it’s one more social worker telling me whatto do.You know what I really need? To getmy house cleaned up.”The social worker,who happened to bea highly trained clinical psychologist,responded by saying,“Would you like tostart in the kitchen?”While the two womenwere cleaning,they had a terriﬁc conversa-tion about what was going on in that fam-ily.When I told the story at a meeting,I wasinterrupted by the head of a university clini-cal psych department who said,“What thattherapist did was unprofessional.”Well,all I can say is if we want effectiveinterventions that have transformativeeffects on people,then we had better rede-ﬁne what is professional,or allowable in theexpenditure of public funds.(from Common Purposeby Schorr,1997)In many countries there is no way forpublicly employed social workers to violatethe opinions of the university professor,butmore independent NGOs could do so.BOX 6.8NGOs can be more ﬂexible than government13_WDR_Ch06.qxd  8/14/03  9:11 AM  Page 104(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Policymakers and providers105water systems that require less technicalinputs for maintenance.Second,some kindsofservices that happen to be highly skill-intensive may be reduced.Curative medicalservices that require trained professionals maybe cut back relative to public works or publichealth education,more intensive in capitaland unskilled labor.It is possible that theseinterventions (low-maintenance water sys-tems,use ofvillage health workers or tradi-tional healers) may always have been under-used.Recent trends may merely have madethis misallocation more costly.Monitoring and performanceAll contracts—both compacts and man-agement relationships within providerorganizations—need to be monitored withindependence and objectivity.With the separa-tion ofthe policymaker and the provider orga-nization,the policymaker will want to knowwhether compact provisions are satisﬁed.For a new agreement that has so far not hadmuch impact on actual policy,the WTO’s Gen-eral Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) isviewed with a surprising degree of both hopeand trepidation.In the current Doha agendanegotiations,some look to the GATS to delivermuch-needed reform of services from which thepoor will also beneﬁt,while others see it as athreat to regulatory sovereignty and pro-poorpolicies.In principle,multilateral negotiations canfoster reform in services,as in goods,by elimi-nating or reducing protective barriers throughmutual agreement and by lending credibility tothe results achieved through legally bindingcommitments.The expectation is that moreopen markets and greater predictability of pol-icy will lead to the more efﬁcient provision ofservices.That is the rationale for the GATS.Weaddress three questions:How much market-opening has happened so far under the GATS?Does the agreement prevent recourse to thecomplementary policies needed to ensure thatthe poor have access to essential services in lib-eralized markets? Could the GATS process leadto liberalization before other necessary reforms,and how can this be prevented?The GATS is certainly wide in scope.Itapplies to virtually all government measuresaffecting trade in almost all services,includingeducational,health,and environmental services.Moreover,in recognition of the fact that manyservices require proximity between consumersand suppliers,trade in services is deﬁned toinclude not only cross-border supply but alsoforeign investment and the temporary migra-tion of service consumers and providers.Thebroad reach of the GATS contrasts with the ﬂexi-bility of its rules.The generally applicable rulesmerely require of each country that its trade-affecting measures be transparent and not dis-criminate among its trading partners.Thus,if acountry were to prohibit all foreign supply andmake this fact public,then it would have met itsgeneral obligations.The extent of market opennessguaranteedby a country depends on its sector-speciﬁc com-mitments.These promises to eliminate or limitbarriers to foreign supply were mainly the out-come of negotiations—but some were volun-teered,particularly in telecommunications.Mostexisting commitments entailed little liberaliza-tion beyond existing market conditions.Manycountries committed on tourism,ﬁnancial,busi-ness,and telecommunication services,but rela-tively few in health,education,and environmen-tal services.Of the 145 WTO member countries,only 43 (12 developing) have madecommitments in primary education,52 (24developing) in hospital services,and none onwater distribution (which was not an explicitpart of the original negotiating list of servicessectors).The most serious charge against the GATSis not its meager harvest of liberalization—after all the process has only recently begun—but that it deprives governments of the free-dom to pursue pro-poor policies.It is arguedthat the rules of the agreement threaten pub-lic education,health,and environmental ser-vices;outlaw universal service obligations andsubsidized supply;and undermine effectivedomestic regulation.These charges do notseem well founded for three reasons.First,ser-vices supplied in the exercise of governmentalauthority are excluded from the scope of theGATS,although the deﬁnition—services thatare not supplied on a commercial basis orcompetitively—offers scope for clariﬁcation.Second,even in sectors that have beenopened to full competition,the agreementdoes not prevent the pursuit of domestic pol-icy objectives,including through subsidies orthe imposition of universal service obligationsas long as these do not discriminate againstforeign suppliers.Finally,the agreement recog-nizes the right of members,particularly devel-oping countries,to regulate to meet nationalpolicy objectives,and its current rules ondomestic regulations are hardly intrusive.However,the concerns noted above are notso much about what the GATS isbut what it maybecomeafter the current (and any future) roundof negotiations—which will aim for more liber-alizing commitments and new rules in areassuch as domestic regulation.Informed debatewould undoubtedly help ensure that futureGATS rules and commitments reﬂect broaderdevelopment concerns and not just the dictatesof domestic political economy or external nego-tiating pressure.At this stage,however,the main issue is notso much what the GATS forces countries to do orwhat it prevents them from doing,but that itdoes not—indeed cannot—ensure the comple-mentary action that is needed to deliver pro-poorliberalization.This raises a legitimate concern:in acomplex area like services,trade negotiations alonecould lead to partial or inappropriately sequencedreform.One possibility—already visible in somecases—is that less emphasis will be placed onintroducing competition than on allowing atransfer of ownership of monopolies fromnational to foreign hands or protecting the posi-tion of foreign incumbents.Another is that mar-ket opening will be induced in countries thathave not developed regulatory frameworks andmechanisms to achieve basic social policy objec-tives.These ﬂaws could conceivably make thepoor worse off.The problem is accentuated bythe difﬁculty in reversing inappropriate policychoices that have been translated into legallybinding external commitments.The danger of adverse outcomes would besubstantially reduced if two types of activitiesreceive greater international support.The ﬁrst isincreased policy research and advice withindeveloping countries and outside to identify theelements of successful reform—and to sift theareas where there is little reason to defer marketopening from those where there is signiﬁcantuncertainty and a consequent need for temperednegotiating demands.An even greater need is forenhanced technical and ﬁnancial assistance toimprove the regulatory environment and pro-poor policies in developing countries.The devel-opment community is already providing suchsupport,but a stronger link could be establishedbetween any market opening negotiated inter-nationally and assistance for the complementaryreform needed to ensure successful liberalization.BOX 6.9Is the GATS a help or a hindrance?13_WDR_Ch06.qxd  8/14/03  9:12 AM  Page 105(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

106WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Competition among providers helps,sincethe policymaker will not feel locked into aparticular provider,obliged to ignore badnews.Ifthe separation between the two is notachieved,an independent regulator or auditorshould be assigned the monitoring activities.Clear and observable provisions makemonitoring easier.When the provisions are notso easily observed,the policymaker may wantto enlist the help ofother kinds ofmonitors.The health program in Ceará,Brazil (see spot-light),used applicants to the program who hadnot been selected as informal monitors.When monitoring is difﬁcult because ofthetechnical nature ofthe service,self-monitoringby professionals may be necessary.InBangladesh attendance by staffis much higherin larger facilities due to informal self-moni-toring,among other factors.307Professionalassociations can also serve as self-monitors,establishing professional,ethical,and technicalstandards for medical care providers,teachers,and engineers.But the risk in self-regulation isthat professional groups become effective lob-byists for their members.A third source ofmonitors is the public.Even ifclients are not the active monitorsdescribed in chapter 4—that is,they are notpurchasers ofservices or direct participants inservice delivery—soliciting information (asprivate business often does) can be useful inpublic services.Publicizing the results ofscorecards led to a substantial improvementofmany services run by the Bangalore Munic-ipal Corporation.This practice was replicatedin most states in India.When day-to-day monitoring to assessperformance is not possible,independentmonitoring ofthe performance ofservices onan occasional basis can still be valuable—bybringing public information to bear onprovider behavior.The Public ExpenditureTracking Survey in Uganda (see spotlight onUganda) is an example.More regular public-ity ofservice characteristics on several dimen-sions—such as absentee rates,regular deliveryofpharmaceuticals,hours ofoperation forelectricity or water—could all mobilize com-munity concern and informal inﬂuence.EvaluationGenerating and disseminating informationare powerful ways ofimproving service deliv-ery.They are also clear public goods and coreresponsibilities ofgovernment.Accurate infor-mation can motivate the public,particularlythe poor,to demand better services—fromproviders and from policymakers—and armthem with facts.Knowledge ofthe real impactofprograms helps the policymaker set priori-ties and design better compacts.Knowledge ofthe impact ofdifferent techniques ofservicedelivery helps the provider organization betterfulﬁll its compact.Ifthe means to better ser-vice is the alignment ofincentives with out-comes,knowing what those outcomes are andhow services contribute to them is central.Good evaluation is the research necessary toassign causality between program inputs andreal outcomes.It should be directed at the fullimpact ofprograms—not just the direct out-puts ofspeciﬁc projects.But few evaluationshave been done well,even though most majordonors (including the World Bank) have alwaysmade provisions for them.Evaluation,thoughprimarily a responsibility ofgovernments,is anarea in which donors can help.It costs a smallfraction ofthe programs examined and a smallfraction ofthe value ofthe information pro-duced,but it does require some expensive tech-nical inputs.And since other countries will usethe results,the international community shoulddefray some ofthe costs.There are impediments to collecting suchinformation.Provider organizations often donot want to acknowledge their lack ofimpact(even ifit does not affect their pay directly),but knowing when things are not working isessential for improvements.Further,it is nec-essary to know not just what works but alsowhy—to replicate the program and increasethe scale ofcoverage.Provider incentivesin eight sizesReturning to the decision tree ofﬁgure 6.2from the perspective ofprovider incentives,the decision concerning the difﬁculty ofmonitoring is,ofcourse,key.When moni-toring is easy—sizes 1,3,5,and 7—oppor-tunities for more explicit incentives and theuse ofcontracts should be explored.How-ever,contracting with a private sector isoften a bad idea for sizes 5 and 7.Such con-tracts are a common source ofcorruptionthat governments ﬁnd harder to manage13_WDR_Ch06.qxd  8/14/03  9:12 AM  Page 106(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Policymakers and providers107and citizens ﬁnd harder to detect than ifservices were provided by government.When monitoring is difﬁcult—the even-numbered sizes—one goal is to improve theability to monitor with the methods dis-cussed in this chapter.More competition,more careful measurement ofoutcomes,the evaluation ofthe effect ofinputs onoutcomes,and the provision ofincentivesto groups ofproviders such as schools ordistricts can all help.The boxes suggest eight sizes appropriatein different circumstances.They also indi-cate the relative difﬁculty ofcarrying themout—the degree ofgovernment failureassociated with them.Generally speaking,the severity ofthe government failureincreases with the size number.The degreeofmarket failure needed to justify relativelyeasy policies to carry out is modest,or,equivalently,the highest-priority policiesare those with large market failures orFigure 6.2Eight sizes ﬁt all12345678HomogeneousclientsHeterogeneousclientsHomogeneousclientsHeterogeneousclientsEasy tomonitorHard tomonitorEasy tomonitorHard tomonitorEasy tomonitorHard tomonitorEasy tomonitorHard tomonitorPro-poorpoliticsClientelistpoliticsCentral government financing with contracting.

108WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004strong redistributive effects.For the hard-est cases such as case 8,market failuresmust be quite costly to justify intervention,given the many legitimate claims on gov-ernment.Including government’s ability toimplement—that is,the degree ofgovern-ment failure to be expected—can lead to asubstantial re-ranking ofpublic policiesrelative to conventional analyses.Forsocial security systems,for example,thereis no particular reason on conventionaleconomic grounds for the public sector tosend out checks to pensioners.But manygovernments with well-developed admin-istrative procedures do it quite well,andthere is no compelling reason to change—market failures are not terrible but neitheris it hard for government to do.Much ofthe controversy about whether rich coun-tries should emulate New Zealand’sreforms surrounds this point.New inno-vations in contracting with a private sec-tor or with a government agency mightimprove the functioning ofgovernmentsomewhat.But ifgovernment is alreadydoing tasks acceptably,the gains may besmall and possibly not worth the disrup-tion caused by the change itself.When applied to the health sector somestandard prescriptions are reinforced bythese considerations while others are chal-lenged.The provision oftraditional publichealth services,such as pest control to pre-vent infectious disease,is relatively easy tocarry out.But stafﬁng and maintaining alarge network ofprimary health centers inremote areas is often hard to do,eventhough the redistribution effects arepotentially beneﬁcial.It might be wiser,until government capabilities improve,totry to get poor people to government facil-ities,even to much maligned hospitals,than get facilities to poor people.Not onlywould this address a serious market fail-ure,the absence ofinsurance for expensivecare,but it will be easier to implementsince working in less remote areas is moreconsistent with providers’interests andeasier to monitor,with a smaller numberoflarger facilities.308Scaling up,scaling back,and wising upThere is no “right”way to make sure servicesreach poor people.The appropriate technicalinterventions—and the institutional struc-tures that generate them—vary enormously.Education was expanded dramatically inChile by markets and vouchers,in Cuba by acentral ministry,and in El Salvador by localschool committees.Beyond trial and error,scaling up means watching what you’redoing,evaluating whether it works,deter-mining why it works or doesn’t,replicatingsuccess,and evaluating the replications aswell.Sometimes things work for idiosyn-cratic reasons—a charismatic (and literallyirreplaceable) leader or a particular (andunrepeatable) crisis that solidiﬁes support fora politically difﬁcult innovation.So one-timesuccesses may not be replicable.Experimen-tation,with real learning from the experi-ments,is the only way to match appropriatepolicies with each country’s circumstances.Scaling up also means scaling back—abandoning failures unless a good,remedia-ble reason for failure is found.Abandoningfailures is harder than it sounds.Simplyadmitting failure is hard enough,particularlyfor politicians.But with the severe resourceconstraints in developing countries—theyare poor after all—badly performing pro-grams are simply unaffordable.Where pro-grams are intensive in management (andauditors and managerial talent are scarce) orintensive in trained personnel (and teachersand doctors are scarce),states need to let goofprograms that are not working and ﬁndalternative ways to achieve better outcomes.Ifthe political will exists,the key to scalingup is information.Beyond evaluating pro-grams and projects,a continuing focus onmaking services work for poor people—edu-cated children,better health,reliable water,lighted homes,safer streets—depends on thecontinuing measurement ofprogress towardthese goals.“What gets measured is whatcounts.”This focus on outcomes helps poli-cymakers choose the best options for servingpoor people.It helps the providers knowwhen they are doing a good job.And it helpsclients judge the performance ofboth.13_WDR_Ch06.qxd  8/14/03  9:13 AM  Page 108(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

bydonors and government was higher in thecontracted-out districts:$2.80 in the con-tracted-in districts,$4.50 in contracted-outdistricts,compared with $2.90 in controldistricts.311These differences are large andrepresent slightly less than 20 percent ofthehealth expenditures (including private andexcluding capital investments from the gov-ernment) in all ofthe districts.Contracting for better resultsAll districts improved service coverage in ashort time.After only 2.5 years ofthe four-year experiment,all districts had achievedtheir contractual obligations for most ofthe evaluation indicators.312The use ofhealth services among the poorest halfofthe populace increased by nearly 30 per-centage points in the contracted-out dis-trict (ﬁgure 1).One possible explanation isthat the contracted-out districts did notcharge ofﬁcial user fees;they also discour-aged health care workers from taking“unofﬁcial”user fees by paying signiﬁ-cantly higher salaries to providers than inthe other types ofdistricts.The pattern ofincreases is similaracross a variety ofservice and coverageindicators (ﬁgure 2).The contracted-outdistricts often outperformed contracted-indistricts,which outperformed control dis-tricts.But not all indicators were as respon-sive.The share ofdeliveries assistedchanged by only a small amount in all threedistricts.And there was no differencebetween contracted-in and contracted-outdistricts in the increase in vitamin A cover-age.The level ofimmunization in con-tracted districts also remained quite mod-est,peaking at only 40 percent.Out-of-pocket expenditures on healthcare services fell dramatically in the con-tracted-out districts but increased slightlyMore than 25 years ofconﬂict leftCambodia with little healthinfrastructure.In the late 1990sits health indicators were among the worstin Southeast Asia.Average life expectancy atbirth was less than 55 years.Infant mortal-ity was 95 per 1,000 live births.And mater-nal mortality was 437 per 100,000 livebirths.309The public health care systemremained rudimentary:average facility usewas 0.35 contacts per person per year,andpatients complained ofvery low quality.Then in 1998 the government con-tracted with nongovernmental entities toprovide health services in several districts.The contracting increased access to healthservices—and not at the expense ofequity.Contracting primary health careservices (in and out)Intervention and control areas consisted ofrandomly selected rural districts,each with100,000 to 200,000 people.310Contractorswere chosen through a competitive processbased on the quality oftheir technical pro-posal and their price.Three approacheswere used.•Contracting out.Contractors had fullresponsibility for the delivery ofspeci-ﬁed services in the district,directlyemployed their staff,and had full man-agement control (two districts).•Contracting in.Contractors providedonly management support to civil ser-vice health staff,and recurrent operat-ing costs were provided by the govern-ment through normal governmentchannels (three districts).•Control areas.The usual governmentprovision was retained (four districts).A budget supplement was provided to con-tracted-in and control districts.Performance indicators were measuredfor all the districts by household,and healthfacility surveys,which were conducted in1997 before the experiment.No district hadin contracted-in and control districts.Thereduction was especially marked among thepoor ($35 a year,or 70 percent),indicatingbetter targeting and more efﬁcient transfersofsubsidies.Even though the health ministry encour-aged all districts to implement ofﬁcial userfees,only one contracted-in district estab-lished a formal user fee system and used thereceipts from the system to reward healthcare workers with monthly performanceand punctuality bonuses.That couldaccount for slightly higher spending for thistype ofdistrict.313There are several possible reasons forthese pro-poor outcomes in the contracteddistricts.•The regular availability ofdrugs and qual-iﬁed staffstrengthened service provisionat health centers in the villages,wheremost poor people are concentrated.•The contracted nongovernmental orga-nizations used a market-based wage andbeneﬁts package to attract and retainhealth care providers.•A reduction in the private out-of-pocketcost ofservices and a more predictableand transparent fee structure increasedthe demand for health care services bythe poor.Contracts to improve health services—quicklyCambodia began experimenting with different forms ofcontracting to improve health services in 1998.The lesson—thanks to good evaluation—is that contracting can help increase the coverage ofsome key services in a short time.Cambodiaspotlight on

111An institutional arrangement for basic edu-cation should be judged by its productionofhigh-quality learning,equitably distrib-uted.This requires that children be inschool and that they learn.This in turn restson education systems that create relation-ships ofaccountability between citizens,politicians,policymakers,and providers,with clear objectives,adequate resources,capable and motivated providers,progressassessments,and performance-orientedmanagements.Successful education systems vary widely.Some systems are centralized,others decen-tralized.Some have almost exclusively pub-lic schools,while others provide public sup-port to private providers.But not justanything goes.•The politics ofschooling—particularlythe effectiveness ofthe voice ofpoorpeople—determines both the school sys-tem’s objectives and the public resourcesthat go to education.•The compact between policymakers andproviders ofschooling needs to balancethe autonomy ofschools and teacherswith performance assessment.•Schools (and school systems) must beenabled to manage for performance—and,particularly,to ﬁnd effective ways totrain and motivate teachers.•Direct parent and community participa-tion in schools,demand-side inducementsto expand enrollments,and choice—ifcorrectly designed—can be valuable partsofan overall plan for school improvement.Common problems of service provisionEducation systems face the common prob-lems ofservice provision outlined in chap-ter 1—unaffordable access,dysfunctionalschools,low technical quality,low clientresponsiveness,and stagnant productivity.But not all countries face the same prob-lems.In many ofthe poorest countriesthere are enormous deﬁcits in affordableaccess.Poor people have less access,lowerattainment,and lower quality than thosebetter off.In many countries public sectorprovision is close to dysfunctional and rifewith corruption.The technical quality ofinstruction and learning outcomes areshockingly low,especially among poor peo-ple.And even the most advanced economiesstruggle to make education systems moreproductive.Shortfalls in universal primary comple-tion—a combined result ofchildren whonever enroll,children who do not progress,and children who drop out—reﬂect the fail-ures in the system.In Madagascar only 52percent of15- to 19-year-olds in the poorest20 percent ofthe population had everenrolled in school,and only 4 percent com-pleted even grade 5 (ﬁgure 7.1).In Brazil 89percent ofpoor adolescents enrolled ingrade 1,but only 30 percent completedgrade 5 because ofhigh dropout and repeti-tion rates.In Turkey high retention throughprimary school,followed by a sharp drop inprogress to the next level,suggests that sys-temic and institutional solutions arerequired to increase achievement.In Ban-gladesh only 60 percent ofpoor adolescentshave completed grade 1,and only 36 per-cent have completed grade 5.Unaffordable accessDespite at least 55 years ofacknowledgmentthat universal literacy is the heart ofdevelop-ment,and despite repeated rhetorical com-mitments to universal enrollment,even theBasic education services7chapter15_WDR_Ch07.qxd  8/14/03  9:19 AM  Page 111(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

modest goal ofuniversal primary schoolcompletion has not been realized.Somecountries have made huge strides—averagecompletion rates in Brazil expanded from lessthan 50 percent in 1990 to more than 70 per-cent in 2000.But ifcountries continue at onlytheir recent rate ofprogress,universal pri-mary completion would come only after2020 in the Middle East and North Africa,after 2030 in South Asia,and not in the fore-seeable future in Sub-Saharan Africa.In the very poorest countries the attain-ment deﬁcit is spread across the population,but in most it is concentrated among chil-dren from poor households.In countrieswith very low attainment,like Mali,most ofthe population is rural,and there are sub-stantial deﬁcits in primary completion evenamong relatively wealthier and urban fami-lies.In India the rural poor (poorest 50 per-cent) accounted for 72 percent ofthe deﬁcitin completion ofgrade 5 among 15- to 19-year-olds,and completion is higher amongboys than girls.In the Philippines the deﬁcitis much lower,concentrated among therural poor and higher among boys thangirls.Dysfunctional schoolsSchooling completions and learning out-comes may fall short because providers aredysfunctional.While most teachers try con-scientiously to do their jobs,one recent sur-vey found a third ofall teachers in UttarPradesh,India,absent.Cases ofmalfeasanceby teachers are distressingly present in manysettings:teachers show up drunk,are physi-cally abusive,or simply do nothing.This isnot “low-quality”teaching—this is not teach-ing at all.314Low technical qualityThe quality ofinstruction can also be lowbecause oflow capability,weak motivation,and a lack ofcomplementary inputs.Invery-low-income settings learning out-comes can be dismal.The 1994 TanzaniaPrimary School Leavers Examination sug-gested that the vast majority ofstudents hadlearned almost nothingthat was tested intheir seven years ofschooling—more thanfour-ﬁfths scored less than 13 percent cor-rect in language or mathematics.315InBangladesh 30 percent ofstudents whocompleted grade 5 were not minimallycompetent in reading;70 percent were notminimally competent in writing.316Evidence on learning outcomes is disap-pointing even in middle-income countries.For instance,in the recent Programme forInternational Student Assessment oftheachievement of15-year-olds in school,only5 percent ofBrazilian students reached theOrganisation for Economic Co-operationand Development (OECD) median inmathematical literacy (ﬁgure 7.2).Fifty-sixpercent ofBrazilian students were at level 1(of5) in reading literacy,compared with 18percent for students in OECD countries.Only 4 percent reached proﬁciency levels of4 or 5,compared with 31 percent for OECDstudents.317This is not to single out Brazilfor poor performance:Brazil is widely rec-ognized for its advances,and its willingnessto participate in the study and its courage inreleasing the results demonstrate a strongcommitment to education outcomes (othercountries have participated in examinationsand then refused to disclose the results).Inaddition,in an earlier comparison of11Latin American countries Brazil was tiedwith Argentina for second place in themathematics performance of4th graders.Low client responsivenessWhen communities are not involved inestablishing,supporting,or overseeing aschool,the school is often seen as some-thing alien.Villagers refer to “the govern-ment’s”school,not “our”school.In Voices ofthe Poorpeople often complain ofabsent orabusive teachers and demands for illegalfees to get their children into school or toinﬂuence examination results.318A study ofschooling in rural Nigeria found that vil-lagers often stopped expecting anythingfrom government schools,shouldering theburden themselves.319Stagnant productivityCreating and maintaining an institutionalenvironment that promotes higher produc-tivity and more learning is not easy.Arecent set ofstudies documented thatspending per pupil in real terms hasincreased by 50 percent or more,often two-112WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Figure 7.1Poor children: less likelyto start school, more likely to drop out15- to 19-year-olds who havecompleted each grade0402080601000012345678901234Grade0123456789Grade0123456789GradeGrade5678940208060100040208060100PercentPercentRichestfifthPoorestfifth040208060100Madagascar 1997Turkey 1996–97Brazil 1996Bangladesh 1996–97PercentPercentSource:Analysis of Demographic and HealthSurvey data.15_WDR_Ch07.qxd  8/14/03  9:20 AM  Page 112(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

or threefold,in nearly all OECD and EastAsian countries.Yet in none ofthese coun-tries have test scores improved commensu-rately.320The obvious implication ofthesetwo facts is that measured learning achieve-ment per dollar spent has fallen dramati-cally in every country examined.For higher-quality systems,strengthen the relationships of accountabilityDespite enormous differences in attain-ment,equity,and learning across countries,the features ofschool systems are strikinglysimilar.Public production is almost alwaysthe dominant—ifnot exclusive—means ofgovernment support ofeducation.Whetherin Argentina,Egypt,India,Indonesia,Paraguay,or Tanzania,public systems dis-play age-grade organization ofclassrooms,replication ofsocial structures and inequal-ities,and similar ways oftraining,hiring,compensating,and promoting teachers.Despite these surface similarities,there arewidely different outcomes.Both Nigeriaand Singapore retain many ofthe organiza-tional elements ofBritish education.Yet onone international achievement test in the1980s Nigeria was among the worst per-formers while Singapore is frequentlyamong the best.That public provision has often failed tocreate universally available and effectiveschooling does not imply that the solutionis a radically different approach (completedecentralization,total control by parentgroups,generalized choice) or a narrowfocus on proximate determinants (moretextbooks,more teacher training).Univer-sal and quality education can come fromvery centralized systems (France,Japan) orfrom very decentralized systems with con-siderable local accountability and ﬂexibility(United States).Many countries have littleprivate schooling,and some a great deal(Holland).Classroom practice is what mat-ters.Ifthe underlying causes offailure arenot addressed,all these approaches can fail.Chapters 3 through 6 developed a frame-work for analyzing service provision,lookingat four relationships ofaccountability.Ineducation,these are:•Voice,or how well citizens can hold thestate—politicians and policymakers—accountable for performance in dis-charging its responsibility for education.•Compacts,or how well and how clearlythe responsibilities and objectives ofpublic engagement are communicated tothe public and to private organizationsthat provide services (Ministries ofEdu-cation,school districts).•Management,or the actions that createeffective frontline providers (teachers,administrators) within organizations.•Client power,or how well citizens,asclients,can increase the accountability ofschools and school systems.Effective solutions are likely to be mixturesofvoice,choice,direct participation,and orga-nizational command and control,with func-tional responsibilities distributed amongcentral,regional,local,and school administra-tions.The pieces have to ﬁt together as a sys-tem.More scope for parental choice withoutgreater information about schooling outputswill not necessarily lead to better results.Infor-mation systems that produce data on inputsBasic education services1130.03675006250.5OECD averageDistribution of mathematics test scores50 percentabove 5000.02813874960.5Mexico8.6 percentabove 5000.02123344640.5BrazilNormalized test score4.4 percentabove 5000.03665006230.5Distribution of reading test scores50 percentabove 5000.03114225350.518 percentabove 5000.02883965070.5Normalized test score11 percentabove 500Note:Distributions are approximated on the basis of the mean and standard deviation reported in theoriginal source.Source:OECD (2001).Figure 7.2Fifteen-year-olds in Brazil and Mexico perform substantially worse onstandardized tests than students in OECD countries15_WDR_Ch07.qxd  8/14/03  9:20 AM  Page 113(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

but do not change the capabilities or incentivesoffrontline providers cannot improve quality.Schools and teachers cannot be made moreaccountable for results without also receivingsufﬁcient autonomy and resources and theopportunities to build capabilities.Conversely,schools cannot be given autonomy unless theyare given clear objectives and regular assess-ments ofprogress.What successful education systems share isa working structure ofaccountability:clearobjectives,adequate resources,and capableand motivated providers.This Report focuseson institutional reforms to achieve that systemofaccountability—not on the proximatedeterminants ofsuccess,such as curriculumdesign,pedagogical methods,textbooks,teacher training,school construction,or newinformation technologies.Institutional re-forms will achieve desired outcomes by affect-ing proximate determinants—and proximatedeterminants that produce good education arethe outcome ofwell-structured and well-func-tioning systems.But efforts to improve proxi-mate determinants through internal manage-ment initiatives have usually failed.Why? Notbecause ofa lack ofknowledge ofwhat to do.But because oflack ofthe sustained bureau-cratic,market,parental,and political pressureneeded to make things work.The disappointing experience with teachertraining shows the limit ofa focus on proxi-mate determinants (box 7.1).When teachersare not consulted in training design—oftenthe case—poor implementation is the result.Training may not be integrated into the sys-tem,as when teachers are trained in methodsinconsistent with public examinations and soare reluctant to adopt them.Teachers oftenhave little incentive besides professional prideto adopt new methods.Ifthe underlying problems are notsolved neither bureaucracy nor market willwork well.Increasing client power,by creat-ing mechanisms for communities and par-ents to improve their local school,is impor-tant.But this short-route accountability isnot enough.Improving services alsorequires stronger mechanisms oflong-routeaccountability—accountability ofpoliti-cians and policymakers for education andimproved proﬁciency in public administra-tion with accountability ofthe educationbureaucracy for outcomes.There is noquick ﬁx in an area as complex and exten-sive as schooling,only the hard slog ofgrad-ual improvement through strategic incre-mentalism,which links current operationalactions with long-run institutional strate-gies and goals.Citizens and clients,politiciansand policymakers:voiceIn administration ofall schools,it must be kept inmind,what is to be done is not for the sake ofthepupils,but for the sake ofthe country.—Mori Anori,Japanese Minister ofEducation 1886–89Politics plays a key role in establishingobjectives for the education system—con-cerning both distribution and quality—andin mobilizing resources.The reason is thatschooling,especially at the basic level,hasbecome an important element in a child’ssocialization.Those who control the state use schoolingto promote beliefs they consider desirable.Nearly everywhere this means that schoolspromote a sense ofnational identity,anational language,and loyalty to the nation-state—in competition with more local orethnic afﬁliations—and,in more extremecases,a speciﬁc political indoctrination.Modern states—from Third Republic France114WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004“Teacher training in this province is a mock-ery.We should close down the teacher train-ing institutes and stop this nonsense.I havebeen teaching in a B.A./B.Ed.program formany years and see no signs that I have anyimpact on the students I teach.”—A university education instructor quoted in Warwick and Reimers (1995).“Most inmates of this system [two teachertraining institutes] have no respect forthemselves,hence they have no respect forothers.The teachers think the students arecheats,the students think the teachers haveshattered their ideals.Most of them are dis-illusioned.They have no hopes,no aims,noambitions.They are living from day to day,watching impersonally as the system crum-bles around them.”—Nauman (1990).A national survey of Pakistan’s primaryschools suggests that these anecdotalaccounts are only too true.Survey data onteaching practices “provide no basis forstatements that ...teacher training makes asubstantial difference to how teachersteach.”A 1998 study of teacher trainingsuggests that “staff and faculty are profes-sionally untrained,political interference iscommon,resources and facilities are poorand badly utilized,motivation and expecta-tions are low and there is no system ofaccreditation to enforce standards.”Embed-ded in an education system that was funda-mentally unaccountable and lacked anyoutcome orientation,teacher trainingreﬂected worst practice.Sources:Warwick and Reimers (1995);Kizilbash(1998),p.45.BOX 7.1The dismal state ofteacher training in Pakistancirca 199015_WDR_Ch07.qxd  8/14/03  9:21 AM  Page 114(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

to Ataturk’s Turkey—have also used publicschools to supplant or suppress religiousinstruction.321Authoritarian states have usedschooling to disseminate a single acceptableideology—for example,Soeharto’s promo-tion ofthe ﬁve principles ofpancasila322inIndonesia.These examples are not the excep-tion but the rule:countries around the worldexplicitly use schooling to inculcate ideasabout the proper organization ofsociety.Voice and the objectives ofschoolingSchooling has become a battleground forpolitical conﬂicts.Different groups want dif-ferent—often contradictory—things fromschooling.Poor parents see education as anopportunity for their children to lead betterlives,but they may also want education toreinforce traditional values.Elites may wantuniversal education but often promote pub-lic spending on higher education for thebeneﬁt oftheir own children.Urban andbusiness coalitions may favor more educa-tion because it increases the productivity oftheir workers,or industrialists may quietlyoppose “too much”education because itmakes workers restive.One recent study ofowners and managers ofmodern factoriesin Northeast Brazil that were moving to cut-ting-edge business practices revealed a dis-turbing lack ofsupport for expanding edu-cation.Many felt that a primary education(eight years) was helpful,but more than thatwas “dangerous”because it created workerswho were less docile.Many commented that“too much education is a bad thing.”(Tendler 2003).Politicians may want todeliver on promises ofuniversal schoolingwhile also using the education system toprovide patronage jobs (the example ofPak-istan,in box 5.3,is not unique).Teachersand their unions want high-quality univer-sal education but also higher wages.To get what you want,you need to knowwhat you want.But what a society wantsfrom its schools is not simple and cannot bedecided by experts alone.A recent study ofattempts to improve the quantity and qual-ity ofbasic education in an Asian country inthe 1990s concluded that even many peda-gogically and internally sound reforms didnot have a sustained impact on teachingpractice or student learning.Why? Because the educational system had nocoherent,consensual focus:“For reforms tostick,there ﬁrst needs to be a vision for thefuture with agreed long-term objectivesderived from stakeholders:informed dia-logue with parents,employers,religious lead-ers,school leavers,and others.The absence ofsuch a shared long-term quality-of-servicesstrategy that focused scarce resources onquality rather than quantity has left the edu-cation sector open to the imposition ofideasfrom outside:from donors,with agendas ofquestionable value to the country’s situation,or from graduates returning with overseasdegrees and ill-informed,though well-inten-tioned,agendas oftheir own.”323Democracy is not necessary for excellentschools.The huge variation in commitmentto schooling across the states ofIndia isenough to suggest that electoral democracy isalso not sufﬁcient for voice to lead to universaleducation (see spotlight on Kerala and UttarPradesh).But the absence ofdemocracy orother means ofeffective citizen voice has ahuge downside.While one-party states occa-sionally produce good results (see spotlighton Costa Rica and Cuba),many authoritarianregimes have no interest in expanding educa-tion or improving its quality.There are tworisks:the system is effective but its goals arecompletely set by politicians and policymak-ers,or the system is ineffective because politi-cians and policymakers have goals other thaneffective provision ofservices.The results:toofew resources are allocated to education,toofew ofthose resources reach poor people,andresources are allocated ineffectively (becauseproviders are more inﬂuential than citizens).As more countries move to more democ-ratic modes ofchoosing leaders,citizen con-trol over the structure and content ofcurric-ula gains prominence.Having a commonnegotiated vision ofthe objectives ofpublicsupport for schooling makes it easier to moveto the other stages ofimproving the quality ofschooling—mobilizing and allocatingresources,communicating objectives toproviders,and delegating responsibility andautonomy to schools.Without a clear visionofgoals,reform is reduced to a focus oninputs and process alone.The greater the demand for education,thesharper the vision.In Malawi,Uganda,andBasic education services11515_WDR_Ch07.qxd  8/14/03  9:21 AM  Page 115(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

most recently Kenya,a commitment to uni-versal education was a popular stance—although a difﬁcult commitment to matchwith resources (see spotlight on Uganda).Adequate resources,adequately distributedTo achieve educational goals politicians andpolicymakers—either autonomously orthrough the pressure ofcitizen voice—mustprovide adequate resources.To learn effec-tively,children need affordable access toinfrastructure,inputs,and instruction—farfrom the case in many countries.A recentstudy ofﬁnancing the global Education forAll initiative compared successful and lesssuccessful countries along three dimensions:•Revenue mobilization for primary edu-cation (overall taxation rates,the frac-tion ofspending on schooling,the frac-tion ofthat spent on primary schooling).•Unit cost ofa year ofeffective schooling(teacher salaries and class size).•Internal efﬁciency (years ofschoolingprovided per primary school completer).Even with adequate ﬁscal effort,reason-able costs,and internal efﬁciency,manycountries do not generate enough resourcesto achieve universal completion.For thesecountries there is a compelling case for addi-tional international assistance (see box 2.3).But in many cases the resources are simplynot used effectively.They are allocated to thewrong mix ofinputs.Too great a share goes tohigher levels ofeducation.Or systems are inef-ﬁcient in translating resources into outputs.Acommon problem is that teacher salaries,evenat very low wages,crowd out all other inputs.Arecent study found that 44 of55 countriesexamined allocated more than 70 percent andhalf(23) allocated more than 80 percent ofspending to salaries.Such levels ofspendingoften imply either inadequate supplies to otherinputs or formal or informal levies on parents.Empirical studies also show that increases inteacher salaries have little or no associationwith learning outcomes (discussed furtherbelow).Many studies estimate the impact ofselected classroom instructional materials orschool facilities to be some 10 times that ofteacher salaries (this is not to say that simple“equipment-based”approaches will succeed).Another common problem is devotingresources to reduce average class sizes,whichoften results in inefﬁciently small classes—boosting unit costs and limiting access.Public resources are politically distrib-uted,so the effective distribution ofresourcesisan issue ofvoice.A review ofthe empiricalevidence suggests that the common patternoftoo few resources to high-productivityinputs is so ubiquitous—ﬁgure 7.3 gives justtwo ofmany possible examples—that it islikely generated by a political economy thatfails to adequately incorporate the voice ofpoor people.Changing this distribution ofresources requires more than a technocraticadjustment—as Brazil has shown by itsreforms in the 1990s.Because poor people are almost always thelast enrolled,additional spending thatexpands access is more favorable to poorerhouseholds than existing spending.A studyin India found that even though educationalexpenditures on average were not more pro-poor than a uniform transfer would be,thepoor beneﬁted more than proportionately atthe margin when enrollments in primaryeducation expanded (since the better-offwere already in school).324So educationexpenditures that expand access are bettertargeted to poor people than resources thatexclusively raise quality.But the quality-quantity tradeoffis not asimple choice between creating additionalschool places or improving instruction.Amajor problem for poor children in nearly116WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Figure 7.3Increases in test scores per dollar spent on different inputs051015200510Increase in test score per dollar,relative to teacher salaryIncrease in test score per dollar,relative to teacher salary1520Packet ofinstructionalmaterialsTeacher table,pupil tables andchairs, and other“hardware”Ensuring allteachers have 3years secondaryschoolTeacher salaryFull packet ofinstructionalmaterialsOne additionalsquare footper studentFacilityimprovementinterventionTeacher salaryNortheast Brazil (1980s)India (1990s)11.97.719.411.21.714Source:Pritchett and Filmer (1999).15_WDR_Ch07.qxd  8/14/03  9:22 AM  Page 116(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

every environment is that they drop out ofschool with greater frequency,in part becausethe quality ofthe schooling they receive is solow.So quality improvements need to accom-pany quantity improvements.Spending on primary schooling is mildlyprogressive,but that on higher levels ofedu-cation is not.With children from the pooresthouseholds unlikely to reach higher levels ofschooling,and with greater per studentspending at higher levels than at lower,chil-dren from richer households capture the bulkofeducational spending.In Madagascar asingle year ofhigher education costs 20 timesthat ofprimary schooling—and only 3 per-cent ofchildren completing lower secondaryschool are from the poorest 40 percent ofhouseholds (table 7.1).Relative cost alone isnot the issue.It is whether funding across lev-els is equitable and efﬁcient—or drivenexclusively by elite politics.The political conditions required for ade-quate budget allocations for education arenot obvious.Simple answers like “democ-racy”are attractive—but just not true.India,democratic since independence,has wealthgaps in education attainment larger than anyother country with comparable data.At leastone empirical study suggests that nondemoc-ratic countries spend more on education.325But there is a risk that these governments carenot about the quality ofeducation but aboutusing schools for religious,secular,ornational indoctrination.In countries withdemocratic elections,schooling opportuni-ties can be limited and education resourcesdevoted to patronage and clientelism ifvoice is weak and control rests with a nar-row elite.Targeting resources to the desti-tute and disadvantaged has political dan-gers as well.Systems that focus mainly onpoor citizens,leaving the middle classes nostake,tend to be ﬁnancially less sustainableand to experience less pressure for account-ability—and so tend to be inefﬁcient andunconcerned with quality.Policymakers and organizationalproviders:compactsI do not care that teachers are offended by it.I amless interested in the teacher’s method ofteachingthan in the result she achieves....There should bea test at the end to see whether the results are beingachieved....Let us who represent the communitysay here and now there should be a [test] no mat-ter who may oppose it....Ifwe want to see that acertain standard is reached and we are paying themoney we have the right to see that something issecured for that money.Eamon de Valera,Irish Prime Minister,1941326The line separating the state as education pol-icymaker (setting the rules ofthe game) andas major organizational provider (runningthe school system) is typically blurred.Theminister ofeducation frequently wears bothhats.Often there is no interest in measuringresults,so there is no way ofmaking the pub-lic provider accountable for results.Clarifying objectives and the roles ofpol-icymakers and providers is a ﬁrst step.With-out specifying desired outputs and outcomesthere is no way to say whether resources aresufﬁcient (sufﬁcient to do what?) or usedeffectively (relative to what goal?).Vagueoversight and vague goals reduce manage-ment to compliance with formal rules forinputs and processes.The resulting lack ofclarity often results in “mission drift”andBasic education services117Table 7.1In Madagascar, at higher levels of education unit costs are much higher and participation of the poor much lowerRatio of cost of a year of Cumulative public spending Share of poorest 40 percent Share of poorest 40 percent in higher education to the cost on graduates of each level in those who complete each those who reach each level of a year of primary school(percent of GDP)level (percent)(percent)No schooling0037.657.8Primary (grades 1–5)10.47.333.7Lower secondary (grades 6–9)2.751.250.53.1Upper secondary (3 years)5.52.56**Higher (4 years)19.68.84*** indistinguishable from zero.Sources:World Bank (2001c) and analysis of Madagascar Demographic and Health Survey.15_WDR_Ch07.qxd  8/14/03  9:22 AM  Page 117(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

distracting struggles within the ministry ofeducation.Lacking a clear mission,the edu-cation ministry is often accused ofbeing cap-tured by a teachers’union rather than repre-senting the collective interest in schooling.The Irish Prime Minister’s insistence ontesting is a common reaction to the perceivedfailure ofschools:a temptation to deﬁne theoutput ofthe school system exclusively as testscores and then to hold schools accountablefor those scores.But accountability too nar-rowly measured distorts the education sys-tem.Only what gets measured gets done.The strict primary completion examinationbrought in so conﬁdently by the Irish govern-ment in the 1940s was gone by the 1960s,inlarge part because ofthese concerns.The compact between policymakers andorganizational providers should create anenvironment in which all schools have themeans and motivation to provide high-qual-ity learning.Whether there is public produc-tion or government funding ofa range ofproviders,the compact should focus on out-puts and outcomes.This requires a means ofassessing a school’s contribution to the col-lective objectives ofeducation,and creatingan environment for organizations to inno-vate and bring those innovations to scale—school autonomy with accountability.The use and abuse ofaccountabilityCreating accountability in schooling is difﬁ-cult.Schooling is discretionary and transac-tion-intensive.It has multiple outputs thatdiffer in measurability and in the difﬁcultyofattribution.And it involves a complex—and not well understood—relationshipbetween inputs and outputs.High-perfor-mance schooling conveys skills,attitudes,and values.Some steps in this process canbe reduced to a detailed script.And someaspects ofinstruction can be replaced bytechnology.But face-to-face interaction andﬂexibility are crucial to high-qualityinstruction.Instructors need to be capableofexercising discretion—in assessing stu-dent mastery,providing feedback,and tai-loring the instructional mode to the studentand subject matter.This classroom behavioris extremely difﬁcult to monitor.Schooling has multiple outputs—someeasily assessed,others not.Assessing masteryofsimple skills through standardized testingis fairly straightforward.But it is difﬁcult toassess how well schooling has conveyed aconceptual mastery that allows applicationto real-world problems.It is still more difﬁ-cult to assess how well schooling hasencouraged creativity.And it is even moredifﬁcult to assess how well schooling hasconveyed values.Assessing success is furthercomplicated because different actors assigndifferent values to different objectives.Designing an accountability system isdifﬁcult because it is difﬁcult to attributespeciﬁc outcomes—or even outputs—tospeciﬁc actors.Ifa 15-year-old has mastered118WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Table 7.2Schools account for only a small part of variance in student learning outcomes (percent)Share of total variance across studentsIIIIIIIVDue to differences in studentDue to differences across Fraction of total variation Share of total variation in performance within schoolsschoolsattributable to student student test performance background differences that is (a) school speciﬁc across schoolsand (b) not attributable to student background differencesacross schools (II minus III)Brazil55452520Russian Federation63371720Czech Republic4852418Korea, Rep. of62381424Mexico46543222Developed country average66342014Source:OECD (2001), Annex B1, table 2.4.15_WDR_Ch07.qxd  8/14/03  9:22 AM  Page 118(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Thechild’s primary school math teachers?Another teacher who motivated the child todo well in all subjects? The child’s currentalgebra teacher? Nearly all empirical studies ofmeasuredlearning achievement agree that home back-ground accounts for most ofthe explainablevariation in learning outcomes,especially inprimary grades.The same studies disagreewidely about how much can be attributed toa child’s school.The recent Programme forInternational Student Assessment studyfound wide variation in differences in studentperformance within or between schools(table 7.2).Halfor more ofthe variation inperformance across schools was due to varia-tion in students’socioeconomic status,not tofactors under school control.In poorer coun-tries the effect ofschools is larger—and thatofparental background smaller.But,in gen-eral,identifying the school’s value added isnot simple.Even for outputs easier to specify andmeasure,not much is known about howinputs affect them.Economists summarizethis relationship under the metaphor ofa“production function.”Little is known aboutthis function because instruction involveshuman beings—teachers and students—inall their complexity.For instance,there isongoing,vigorous debate about the relevanceofclass size for student test scores.Someassert that class size is irrelevant,or nearly so.Some assert that reductions in class size havesuch a salutary impact on performance thatthey are a cost-effective means ofimprovingperformance.327After more than a century ofwidespread use ofclassroom instruction,intelligent,well-meaning,and methodologi-cally sophisticated researchers are still debat-ing such a seemingly simple issue.That showshow truly complex the research questionsare—the results will vary across time,con-tent,and context.Assessment systemsNational assessment systems are essential formonitoring educational achievement.But per-formance measurement is as complex as themany goals societies have for their schools.Performance measurement is not an attemptto reduce the output ofschooling to the abilityofstudents to answer questions on standard-ized examinations.The dangers oftest-basedschool accountability have been debated for atleast 140 years (box 7.2).You get what you payfor.But there are also dangers in too littleattention to performance.It is important todistinguish among the three types ofassess-ment:sample-based assessments to track per-formance over time,“gatekeeper”examina-tions that are high stakes for students,andassessments ofschool performance.Tracking progress.One way to strengthenthe compact between policymakers and edu-cation providers is to develop measurementand reporting systems that allow investiga-tion ofvalue for money.Standardized exami-nations are a relatively inexpensive device formonitoring progress and effectiveness.Butfew education systems in the developingworld have disaggregated the cost ofrunninga school,and even fewer know how that costis associated with learning.So there is almostno reporting based on such measurements.The lack ofinformation leads to an inabilityto act accordingly.When the data are revealed,they can besurprising.One study that generated datarelating expenditures and learning at theBasic education services119Test-based school accountability mightseem like the latest thing.It isn’t.British leg-islation for school funding in 1862 includeda system of “payments for results.”In addi-tion to a base grant (based on number ofchildren and attendance),schools receiveda grant for each student who passed aseries of tests given by school inspectors inreading,writing,and arithmetic.Proponents of the testing argued thatperformance-based transfers were onlycommon sense since public money wasinvolved.As one parliamentary proponentreasoned:paying for performance willeither be cheap (because few schools meetthe standard) or expensive (because manystudents have high performance)—but itwill not be both expensive and ineffective.Educational historians claim that the pay-ments provided teachers (who at the timehad little training) with clear indications ofwhat was valued and tangible awards forachievement.Opponents raised the same argumentsmade today.Teachers will “teach to the test”and ignore subjects not covered by the test(such as history and geography).Test-basedaccountability will lead to teaching meth-ods that emphasize rote memorization andcramming.One educator argued that “pay-ment for results”would “be rememberedwith shame.”This particular system of “payment forresults”was abolished in 1890.But thedebate continues today.Sources:Based on Bowen (1981) and Good andTeller (1969).BOX 7.2Test-based accountability—nothing new underthe sun15_WDR_Ch07.qxd  8/14/03  9:23 AM  Page 119(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

school level in Africa found little connec-tion—Mauritanian schools with similarspending had pass rates ofless than 5 per-cent and more than 95 percent (ﬁgure 7.4).Needed for active management aredata—on school costs,on the characteris-tics ofstudents,and on school performanceon cognitive achievement tests.Onceimplemented,these sample-based systemscan be gradually scaled up to provide morecensus-like measurements.Gatekeeper examinations.In most coun-tries examinations are seen as a fair way ofallocating limited school places.One studysuggests that the impact on student perfor-mance ofcentralized curriculum-basedexaminations is as large as that associatedwith differences in parental education orwith substantially more formal educationfor teachers (ﬁgure 7.5).Since centralizedexaminations make relevant informationwidely available,they can be useful for gen-erating accountability.The impact ofpublic examinations onthe incentives ofvarious actors points tosystemic considerations.For instance,teacher training programs often attempt toinstill pedagogical techniques that promotehigher-order thinking skills.But when gate-keeper public examinations assess only rotememorization,teachers frequently revert tosimilar methods.And ifpublic examina-tions have a major impact on students’lifechances,parents will exert pressure on theschool system for better examinationresults.Where public examinations are lim-ited and educationally inadequate,perversepressures can worsen true educational qual-ity in the interests ofbetter examinationscores.School-based accountability for examina-tion results.School accountability is con-troversial—with good reason.There isempirical evidence that accountability mech-anisms based on examination results lead to“teaching to the test”and to attempts tomanipulate results.Evidence from locationsas diverse as rural Kenya (see chapter 11 andbox 7.5 later in this chapter) and urbanChicago shows that accountability raisedexamination scores—but also that teachersmanipulated the students taking the exam,and taught to the test.But teaching to the test is a criticism onlyifthe test is not a reliable assessment oftheskills that are the objective ofpublic sup-port for schooling—or ifthe tests divertteachers from more productive activities,such as teaching higher-order thinking.There is a tradeoffbetween what the testcosts (in design,testing,and scoring) andhow well it captures desired schooling out-put.Tests in some circumstances coulddivert teachers from more productive to lessproductive activities,such as “drills.”But inmany cases performance is so weak thateven “less productive”but learning-ori-ented activities would be an improvement.120WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 20040CentralizedexamsMathScienceTeacher withPhD/MA/bachelor degree5101520Parent completedtertiary/secondaryeducationIncremental test scoreSource:Wößmann (2003).05,00010,000Unit cost (Mauritanian currency)Pass rate (percent)15,00020,000020406080100Source:Mingat (2003).Figure 7.4School success depends on more thanspending per student Primary school pass rate in MauritaniaFigure 7.5Centralized exams have a strong impacton student performance15_WDR_Ch07.qxd  8/14/03  9:23 AM  Page 120(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

There are three important technicaldesign issues with school-based account-ability.First,the characteristics ofstudents,their peers,and their families are far andaway the largest determinants ofvariation inperformance.Any attempt to judge schoolson their level ofperformance will thereforebe judging the socioeconomic compositionofthe school—a “good”school might sim-ply have wealthier students.This is true onaverage.Some schools serving poorer popu-lations perform well or even very well (ﬁg-ure 7.6).And some schools with wealthierstudents are mediocre.To focus on school value added ratherthan differences based on school popula-tions,scores can be empirically adjusted forthe composition ofthe student body (box7.3).Or assessments can measure changes instudent performance (which assumes thatsocioeconomic composition is roughly con-stant).Or a threshold can be set that allschools—whatever their student composi-tion—are expected to achieve.A second design issue in school-basedaccountability is statistical sampling.Inmany schools the number ofstudents issmall enough to result in considerable vari-ability.That means that even schools withstrong improvements over time will haveyears when scores are lower than in previ-ous years—simply because ofthe mix andnumber ofstudents.It also means that aprogram ofrewards or punishments forperformance would disproportionatelyreward and punish small schools relative tolarge schools.The third design issue iswhether to reward good performance orintervene in bad performance—or both.School autonomyAccountability and autonomy are twins.Traditional public sector bureaucracies havelittle autonomy because accountability islinked to rules and procedures,which allowsfor little discretion.The heads ofindividualschools are often bound by process require-ments and so have little autonomy toactively manage their schools—to deﬁne amission,choose instructional staff,inno-vate,or encourage performance.Grantinggreater autonomy requires new forms ofaccountability based on outputs and out-comes.The roles ofthe ministry ofeduca-tion can be unbundled so as to separate edu-cation policy from the operation ofschools.A more explicit compact relationship can bemade with organizational providers,per-haps even with multiple providers withinthe same jurisdiction.This structure cangive clearer guidance on desired outputs andoutcomes,freeing school heads and teachersto pursue deﬁned goals.Nicaragua created autonomous publicschools guided by a school directive councilcomprising the school head,elected teach-ers,parents,and students.The schoolretained revenue from students,and thecouncil could make decisions about person-nel,ﬁnance,and pedagogy.The averageschool autonomy reported by these schoolswas between that reported by traditionalpublic schools (very little) and privateschools (almost complete).The degree ofself-reported school autonomy was posi-tively correlated with student performanceon test scores at the primary level (thoughnot at the secondary)—but autonomy onpaper was not.In a study in Chile very littleofthe variation (less than 1 percent) inthree measures ofself-reported autonomyofteachers was between the four types ofschools—public,private voucher,privatepaid,and Catholic voucher.More ofthevariation was between schools ofthe sameBasic education services121Since 1996 Chile has had an award for “top-performing”schools in each region.Ninetypercent of the award goes directly to teach-ers (in proportion to their hours of employ-ment),and 10 percent is allocated to theschools.The awards are given every twoyears.Schools are divided into comparisongroups within each region of the countrybased on location (rural,urban),educationlevel (primary only,secondary withprimary),and socioeconomic status of par-ents (according to information collected aspart of the examination and an ofﬁcial“index of vulnerability”).In 2000–01 thisclassiﬁcation produced 104 comparisongroups.In this way the performance of poorrural schools is not compared head-to-headwith that of richer urban schools.Analysissuggests that this procedure diminishes thecorrelation between socioeconomic statusand awards.Next,an index of school performance iscalculated based on standardized tests inSpanish and mathematics in grades 4,8,and 10.The index is weighted for averagetest level (37 percent) and improvement intest scores (28 percent) and includes othercriteria such as “equality of opportunity”(22percent)—based on student retention andno “discriminatory practices”—and “initia-tive”(6 percent)—based on regular devel-opment of group pedagogical activities.The program has been through threerounds of selection,with 2,520 schools hav-ing received awards once,1,084 schoolstwice,and 360 schools in all three rounds.Source:Mizala and Romaguera (2002).BOX 7.3School-based performance awards in ChileFigure 7.6In Chile, good schoolsservice

type (between 15 and 18 percent),and mostwas between teachers in the same school.328Teacher autonomy in classroom tasksconsistently emerges as a determinant ofsuccess (box 7.4).The principles developedin chapter 6 are apt:discretion and deci-sionmaking power need to be delegated tothose with the relevant information andprofessional skills.Centralized control ofteacher assignment and assessment cancause bureaucratic paralysis.But makingschools autonomous in curriculum design,examinations,assessment,and ﬁnance canlead to excessive variability across schools.Innovating,evaluating,and scaling upThe goal ofschool autonomy and account-ability is to create a system in which organiza-tional providers have strong,sustained incen-tives to improve outputs.The problem is nota lack ofinnovation—there is a continualstream ofnew modes ofteacher training,newteaching methods,new instructional inputs,new use ofthe latest technology.The problemis that there is too little systematic learningfrom innovation and too little replication ofproven innovations.The contrasting use ofrigorous evalua-tions in health and education is striking.Inmost developed countries no drug can beused until it is proven safe and effective,andthe standard ofproofis the randomizeddouble-blind clinical trial.But in schooling,instructional practices for hundreds ofmil-lions ofchildren can be changed because anew technology appears promising.Orbecause a group ofexperts thinks so.Orbecause the practice has been tried in a pilotprogram (and subject to “Hawthorne”effects,the nonreplicable impacts thatoccur simply as a result ofthe increasedattention from any innovation).Or becauseit has been shown to be statistically corre-lated with success,subject to all the dangersofimproperly inferring causation.There isstrikingly little use ofrandomized con-trolled experiments as a routine manage-ment practice—despite its eminent feasibil-ity for many classroom practices (box 7.5).A recent example ofevaluating a school-ing innovation illustrates the power ofﬂexi-bility in design—and the power ofevalua-tion.A remedial education program,established as a collaboration between thegovernment and a nongovernmental orga-nization (NGO) in two cities in India(Mumbai and Vadodara),hired localwomen to teach catch-up classes for stu-dents who were falling behind.The programwas inexpensive—$5 a child a year.A rigor-ous evaluation based on the randomizeddesign ofthe program found it very effectiveat boosting learning,especially amongpoorer children.The evaluation showedthat,at the margin,extending the programwould be about ﬁve times more cost-effec-tive than hiring new teachers.329 The pro-gram is implemented now in 20 Indiancities,reaching tens ofthousand ofchildren.But “there is a particular irony to educa-tion reform ...[as] pockets ofgood educationpractice ...can be found almost anywhere,signifying that good education is not theresult ofarcane knowledge.Yet the rate ofuptake ofeffective practices is depressingly122WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004The Third International Mathematics andScience Study (TIMSS) created a data set onstudent performance and characteristicsand on institutional characteristics of theschooling system such as use of centralizedexaminations and central,local,and schooldecisionmaking responsibilities.Analysis ofthe performance of more than 266,000 stu-dents from some 6,000 schools in 39(mostly OECD) countries yielded the follow-ing conclusions:•Money cannot buy quality in presentschooling systems.•Incentives are the key to success.•Schools should be allowed to decideautonomously on operational tasks.•Schools must be made accountable.•Teachers’incentives have to focus onimproving student performance.•Competition between schools createsincentives for improving performance.A second study,the OECD Programmefor International Student Assessment,assessed “young people’s capacity to

students in 32(mostly OECD) countries along with infor-mation from students and principals aboutthemselves and schools.The conclusions forwhat schools can do to make a differencewere:•Students’reported use of schoolresources was more closely associatedwith performance than principals’reportsof resource deﬁciencies.•The ratio of students to teachers matterswhere it is high,while in the typical rangethere is a much weaker association withperformance.•Three factors of school policy are associ-ated with better student performance:school autonomy,teacher morale andcommitment,and other teacher factorssuch as expectations.•Three classroom practices reported bystudents show a positive association withperformance:the extent to which teach-ers emphasize performance,teacher-stu-dent relations,and the disciplinaryclimate of the classroom.•Successful students are more likely to dohomework.Sources:Wößmann (2003) and OECD (2001).BOX 7.4Two large-scale

low and effective schools are often found justa few blocks from dysfunctional ones.”330The U.S.Agency for International Develop-ment (USAID) attempted to refocus itsefforts in education in Africa from “proxi-mate determinants”to a more systemicapproach that focuses on internally drivenidentiﬁcation and scaling up ofgood prac-tices.A recent review ofUSAID projectsbased on systemic reform found,not surpris-ingly,that implementation was difﬁcultbecause it went to the heart ofthe relation-ships ofaccountability among actors in edu-cation—and that was intensely political.Even so,recent work at USAID exploressolutions to the challenges oflinking author-ity,accountability,and transparency tostrengthen basic education through institu-tional reform.There are several ways ofexpanding and scaling up good practice.331The most obvious way is to use greaterschool autonomy—leaving scope for schoolmanagement to deﬁne a school mission,mandate,and tactics—and greater account-ability to enable the monitoring ofperfor-mance.The autonomy and accountabilitycreate incentives to adopt proven successfulpractices,to evaluate the effectiveness ofhomegrown initiatives,and to create a senseofpride and commitment in the school.Accountability is,ofcourse,difﬁcult todeﬁne.Is it accountability within thebureaucracy (so that policymakers chooseand replace principals based on perfor-mance)? Is it the direct participation ofpar-ents or school councils in choosing schoolmanagement? Is it parental choice?There are alternatives.One is to allow themost competent actors (principals,teach-ers) to run more than one school.Thiswould allow the more competent to affectgreater numbers ofchildren—and reducethe sphere ofinﬂuence ofthe less compe-tent.A second way is to systematize a vari-ety ofstandard-provision models that areeasy to replicate and franchise,whether thefranchise is a bureaucracy or a privateprovider.Franchise models should be basedon local research on what capable principalscurrently do in a variety ofreal settings aswell as on citizen dialogue around theemerging models.Models could also bebased on statistical analysis ofthe maxi-mum “output”produced by schools,usingthe average level ofresources that schoolscan typically mobilize.None ofthese approaches to learningabout learning is possible without assess-ments ofoutputs—not just standardizedexams but assessment ofall the relevantBasic education services123Since 1996 a group of researchers has beenworking with a Dutch nonproﬁt (InternationalChristelijk Steunfonds) supporting schools inrural Kenya to estimate the impact of variousinterventions.Through random selection someschools were chosen to implement theinterventions ﬁrst,with the other schools to fol-low.This allowed the researchers to test a num-ber of ideas.Textbooks.Everybody knows that textbooksare important and that their lack is a major con-straint on effective instruction.Yet the ﬁrst studyfound “no evidence that the provision of text-books in Kenyan primary schools led to a largepositive impact on test scores,nor is there anyevidence that it affected daily attendance,graderepetition,or dropout rates.”Does this meanthat textbooks don’t matter? No.Although text-books did not increase the performance of thetypical (median) student,they did improve per-formance for students who did the best on thepre-test.This suggests that because thetextbooks in this instance were too difﬁcult forthe typical student,the books did not matter.Teacher incentives.Everybody knows thatteacher incentives are crucial since teachers areundermotivated.Yet a study on incentives forteachers based on student test scores foundthat “teachers responded to the programprimarily by seeking to manipulate short-runtest scores....[T]eachers’absence rates did notdecline,homework assignments did notincrease,teaching methods did not change.”Does this mean that teacher incentives don’tmatter? No.Teachers did change theirbehavior—they “conducted special coachingsessions and encouraged students to take thetest.”This suggests that you get what you payfor—whether you like it or not.Deworming.Deworming does not featurewidely in the education effectiveness literature.Yet a randomized trial of an inexpensive medicaltreatment for hookworm,roundworm,whipworm,and schistosomiasis found that itreduced absenteeism by a quarter.Does thismean that health is all that matters? No.Whileattendance improved,test scores did not.Three observations.First,things that every-body “knows”to be important did not work asplanned,whereas the intervention with lowerexpectations had large impacts.Second,theseresults from a hundred schools in an isolatedarea of Kenya have been getting enormous aca-demic attention because there are so few rigor-ous,randomized evaluations of schooling inter-ventions.Third,the ﬁndings from eachintervention do not reveal universal,immediately generalizable results,but theyreveal that speciﬁcs matter and that learningabout what works needs to be local to be useful.Sources:Miguel and Kremer (2001);Glewwe,Ilias,and Kremer (2000);Glewwe,Kremer,and Moulin(1997).BOX 7.5Randomized experiments in Busia district,Kenya15_WDR_Ch07.qxd  8/14/03  9:25 AM  Page 123(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

outputs ofschooling.Nor is any possiblewithout enough organizational autonomyfor individual schools or groups ofschoolsto decide how best to act.Organizational and frontlineproviders:managementManaging for effective services means get-ting people with the right skills and trainingin place (capacity).It means giving themthe right infrastructure and inputs to workwith (logistics).And it means ensuring themotivation (both extrinsic and intrinsic) offrontline workers.The typical public schoolis often handicapped in these endeavors innearly every possible way.Individual schoolmanagers often cannot choose their ownteachers and cannot dismiss them—evenfor good cause.Teacher training and capac-ity building are often ill-designed andpoorly integrated,and so become irrele-vant.Logistical issues are beyond an indi-vidual school’s control—with decisionscentralized and bureaucratic.Compensa-tion structures tend to be tied to seniorityand level ofeducation or training,not todemonstrated mastery ofskills.Andalthough pay,or other extrinsic motivation,is not the only motivator for education pro-fessionals,the typical structure ofworkingconditions and pay undermines even theintrinsic motivation ofproviders.Employment relationship and structure ofcompensationThere is no single best approach to com-pensation,capacity building,and classroomautonomy.Indeed,one ofthe major bene-ﬁts ofgreater autonomy is that it allowsmore experimentation and more ﬂexibilityin implementation and replication.Withschool autonomy,organizations can try dif-ferent compensation schemes,trainingmethods,and modes ofparent-teacherinteraction and can evaluate them relativeto output and outcome objectives.Ifthepublic sector can specify what it wants froma school—a clear compact—it can leaveteacher compensation to school manage-ment and let the best system win.Teacher pay can be too low (where inﬂa-tion has eroded real salaries to the pointwhere teachers resort to alternative sourcesofincome) or too high (where pay is severaltimes higher than needed to attract a qual-ity pool ofteachers).But appropriate com-pensation involves more than the level ofpay.It is the overall attractiveness oftheprofession and the structure ofcompensa-tion that motivate performance.332Teacherpay is usually linked to factors that show lit-tle association with student performance—mainly seniority.Teacher earnings thusexhibit much less variance than earnings ofworkers in other occupations.Compensa-tion should reward good teaching,not justlongevity.Motivation and capabilitiesThe schooling process is so complex—thedifﬁculties ofattribution so severe—thatsimple proposals of“pay for performance”for individual teachers and principals haverarely proved workable.333But a total lack ofconnection between incentives and perfor-mance allows excellent teachers working inadverse circumstances and those who nevershow up to be paid the same amount.Thisundermines the morale ofgood teachersand drives them out ofthe profession.But motivation is affected by more thanmoney,as a study ofteachers in three types ofschools in Merida,República Bolivariana deVenezuela (nonproﬁts,state,and national),shows.Catholic Fe y Alegria schools—whichcater to low-income families—emphasizeschool autonomy and teacher input in deci-sionmaking.Even though pay is roughly thesame as in state and national schools,teachersatisfaction—and student performance—aremuch higher (table 7.3).Enhancing teachers’capabilities is clearlyfundamental to good-quality schooling,butexperience with teacher training is frequentlydisappointing,mainly because oftoo littletransfer from training to classroom practice.Teachers need training that lets them do theirjob better.But autonomy,motivation,andassessments ofproviders (based on outputsand outcomes) are needed for training toimprove outcomes.Client powerClient power is a weak force in publicschool systems.Channeled into narrowinterests,it has little impact.In nearly all124WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 200415_WDR_Ch07.qxd  8/14/03  9:25 AM  Page 124(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

countries parents can choose schools fortheir children,within limits.But choice haslittle or no overall impact on school qualitybecause there is typically no effect either onschools that lose children or on those thatgain them.Even when parents abandon thepublic system and pay for private schools—as is happening in many countries—littlesystemic pressure for change is createdbecause government resources continue toﬂow into public schools.Direct parentalparticipation in schools is also typically aweak force since there is little about publicschools that parents can affect.Often theschool head and teachers themselves havelittle or no autonomy to make changes.Par-ent organizations are simply a means ofmobilizing additional resources for theschool.There are ways to change this,to use clientpower to improve outcomes.One is toinvolve citizens directly in the assessment andoperation ofschools.Another is to usedemand-side subsidies to increase access forpoor people.A third is to make providerresources depend on client choice—to havemoney follow students.None is a panacea,but each can be part ofa strategy for schoolimprovement.Direct participation: communityinvolvement in schoolsSince students,and indirectly their parents,interact daily with the education system,theyhave valuable information about providerperformance that tends to be ignored inpurely bureaucratic systems.Several success-ful experiences with giving parents a formalrole in school governance have heightenedinterest in this model:•The emergence ofcommunity-runschools in El Salvador showed that theyperformed as well in test scores and in stu-dent dropout rates as schools operated bythe ministry ofeducation,which cateredto wealthier children (see the spotlight onEduco).•In Cambodia a donor-ﬁnanced initiativesought to improve schools by stimulat-ing greater community engagement inschools and using direct budget transfersto schools (box 7.6).•Evidence from Argentina supports theidea that parental participation togetherwith school autonomy raises student per-formance.334•NGOs can help both through directengagement with communities andthrough creating and disseminating infor-mation—as in the system ofschool infor-mation for communities in Nepal assistedby Save the Children-UK.Basic education services125Table 7.3Autonomy and outcome in Merida, República Bolivariana de Venezuela, in the mid-1990sSchool typeCost per student and Salaries as share of Teacher satisfactionaStudent performance Retention rate, grades per student hour operating expenses (average of math, 1–6 (percent)(bolivar)(percent)reading, writing, percent)State (escuelas integrales)190, 24953.754051National160, 32993.573942Private (Fe y Alegria)155, 31884.0253100a.

Informal and community schools exist inmany settings,most often when parents takematters into their own hands and arrangefor teaching outside the formal system.Thisis often supported by NGOs and religiousorganizations.A recent review ofinitiativesin Ethiopia points to the potential ofthissupport for expanding access to schooling(box 7.7).The big question is how to linkthese efforts to the formal system so thatinformal schools are not a dead end.Greater parental involvement in schoolmanagement has its risks.Parents needaccess to relevant information and thepower to effect change.Their focus shouldbe on performance,not on micromanagingthe classroom,where teachers should haveprofessional autonomy.It is fairly straight-forward for parents to assess whether theinstructor is present and not abusive to stu-dents.But high-quality teaching cannot bereduced to scripted actions.Parents oftenhave a very conservative perspective onteaching methods and will encourage teach-ing to the test when there are gatekeeperexaminations.Ensuring that the poorest arenot excluded from this process is essen-tial—and difﬁcult.Experience with school-based control in South Africa suggests a keyrole for training parent groups:without thetraining the more advantaged populationsbeneﬁted while poorer and less powerfulgroups lost out.Direct participation in schools raises thedifﬁcult issue ofuser fees and their relation-ship to community engagement.Someargue that as long as locally collected feesare retained by the school,fees are a goodthing,for two reasons.First,empiricalstudies suggest that centrally controlledresources are almost universally devotedlargely to payroll,while resources collectedat the school level raise school quality bymuch more than equivalent resources fromhigher levels.335A study in Mali showed thatpaying fees left parents better off(on aver-age) because the value ofincreased schoolquality was much larger than the feeitself.336Second,ifcommunities are to feelpride in their school and empowered bytheir participation,then parents should beexpected to make some contribution.Pay-ment may come in-kind,such as labor forconstruction ofthe school,rather than asdirect fees for use.But these potential beneﬁts ofgreatercommunity engagement have to be weighedagainst the apparently large negative effectson enrollments ofeven very low user fees inpoor countries and against the increases ininequality from relying on fees (see box4.4).Some might argue the ideal is a com-promise ofa fairly apportioned fee on com-munities to generate ownership but withsigniﬁcant exemptions for poor households(subsidized from a central fund).Recentexperience with such targeting (as in SouthAfrica) suggests that it is difﬁcult to makethis work.337Demand-side transfersMany governments use scholarships or con-ditional transfers (households receive bene-ﬁts ifchildren are enrolled) to expandenrollments.The Education,Health,andNutrition Program ofMexico (Progresa)126WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Ethiopia is a large country with a heteroge-neous population.Education levels are low:only 24 percent of children complete primaryschool.There are very few schools in poorand remote areas:only about 30 percent of10-year-olds in rural areas have ever attendedschool.But recent innovations sponsored byNGOs show other ways of getting schools tothese children.Programs run by six NGOs reveal howexpanding school places is possible even inremote areas—at reasonable cost and with-out sacriﬁcing quality.The NGO ActionAidproposed adapting school models used bythe Bangladesh Rural Advancement Commit-tee in Ethiopia,and since then several otherNGOs have sponsored similar programs.Theschools share several features:•Compressing four years of the ofﬁcialcurriculum into three years.•Streamlining the curriculum to reducerepetitiveness and remove elementsdeemed irrelevant to local needs.•Using instructional routines that appealto children,such as songs or teaching ingroups.•Scheduling classes on days and timesapproved by the community.•Involving community members in moni-toring the attendance of teachers andstudents.•Targeting class sizes of about 35students.•Recruiting teachers and teaching assis-tants from local areas and paying themless than professional teachers.•Spending more on textbooks,otherinstructional materials,training,andsupervision.The results are promising.Childrenattending these schools continue on tohigher grades.Moreover,learning does notappear to have suffered.Test scores in thesecond grade were about 20 percent higherthan in government schools,and scores inthe fourth grade were only slightly lower,even though the schools catered tochildren from poorer families.All this at alower cost per student.Issues remain,however—particularlyabout scaling up these programs to reachmore children,the more so since some ini-tial success was driven by a few energeticindividuals.Source:Ministry of

has drawn considerable attention because—unusual for this type ofeffort—it was struc-tured to allow rigorous impact evaluations.The program has resulted in substantiallyhigher transitions to secondary school.338InBangladesh a study found that conditionaltransfers ofrice raised enrollments.Theprogram was also cost-effective relative toother interventions,though the governmentrecently moved to monetize the beneﬁts dueto concerns about leakage.339Indonesiaintroduced a large scholarship program inresponse to the economic crisis in 1997.Theprogram helped maintain junior secondaryschool enrollments.340Conditional cash transfers have provedeffective in expanding enrollments,but theyhave shortcomings.They focus on enroll-ment without creating incentives forimproving quality.To the extent thatdemand-side transfers use funds that wouldotherwise have been devoted to schoolimprovement,there is the risk ofexpandingquantity at the expense ofquality.Therewas widespread concern that school feedingprograms in India were “too successful”inattracting students.Schools were ﬂoodedwith underage children not ready for learn-ing,which put even more pressure on qual-ity at the critical lower grades.Resources and client choiceThe Universal Declaration ofHuman Rights(Article 26) asserts that parents have a “rightto choose the kind ofeducation that shall begiven to their children.”Despite this apparentendorsement ofparental choice,there is littleconsensus about its role.In practice,there is a large amount ofchoice.A substantial fraction ofschooling iscarried out by a range ofprivate providers:for-proﬁt schools,religious and denomina-tional schools,NGO-operated schools,andcommunity-owned and -operated schools.In some countries the proportion ofchil-dren in private schooling is rising rapidly—even without public support.In Pakistanthe proportion ofurban students in publicschools fell from 72 percent in 1991 to 60percent in 1996 to 56 percent in 1998—withmost ofthe shift to private,nonreligiousschools (religious schools accounted foronly 1 percent).Sometimes there is govern-ment support for these schools—as forCatholic schools in Argentina or Islamicschools in Indonesia—or there is support toparents who choose private schools—as inChile,the Czech Republic,the Netherlands,and New Zealand.What kind ofrelationship should gov-ernments have with nonpublic providers?One decision is whether to allow demand-side transfers or scholarships to be used innonpublic schools.Colombia used scholar-ship programs for private schools to expandenrollments for poor students.The fact thatparticipants were chosen randomly from apool ofapplicants allowed for rigorousimpact evaluation,which found signiﬁcantpositive impacts for scholarship recipi-ents.341But even though the program wasboth targeted and apparently effective,itwas discontinued—for bureaucratic andpolitical reasons.A second decision involvesmore generalized support for nonpublicschools.In general,it is hard to say anythingabout “choice”without provoking contro-versy,but here are four tries.General subsidies to private schooling—neither disaster nor panacea.Althoughthere is a wide-ranging and still inconclusiveempirical debate about the impact ofgener-alized choice,providing general subsidies toprivate schooling has never been a disas-ter—or a panacea.The Netherlands has hadfull school choice among public anddenominational providers since 1920,with-out terrible repercussions.Chile has hadchoice since 1980,and while there is somecontroversy about whether it has producedsubstantial gains in measured learning out-comes (Hsiao and Urquoila 2002),no oneargues it has been a disaster.New Zealand hashad school choice since 1991,and in a recentassessment of32 countries,came in third inmath and sixth in reading and science liter-acy.The Czech Republic and Sweden havehad public ﬁnancing ofprivate schools sincethe 1990s.So choice is neither an ivory towernotion that could never work in practicenor an ideological Trojan horse that woulddestroy public schooling.It is also not auniversal remedy.The successful expansionofchoice has nearly always been embeddedBasic education services12715_WDR_Ch07.qxd  8/14/03  9:27 AM  Page 127(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

in a more general program ofschool reformand improvement.Parents who exercise choice perceivethemselves to be better off.But schoolingtransmits beliefs and values,which impliesa distinction between meeting the collectivegoals ofcitizens for publicly ﬁnancedschooling and satisfying the clients ofschooling.Parents acting as citizens maywant publicly supported schools to encour-age all children to be tolerant and respectfulofother people’s beliefs.Yet these same par-ents acting as clients may want their chil-dren to receive instruction in the absolutecorrectness ofa particular set ofbeliefs.Asystem that satisﬁes every individual par-ent’s demands as a client might fail to meetthe collective goals ofcitizens for publiclysupported schools.Doubts about choiceoften arise from the impact ofschooling onsocialization.342But this argument cutsboth ways:ifsocialization is chosen by anauthoritarian government to repress indi-vidual or group rights,choice is all the moreimportant.Using taxes for private schools requiresaccountability.While parents should beallowed to choose their child’s educationand create their own accountability,usingtaxes for private schools requires publicaccountability.For choice to be effective increating greater accountability,parentsneed timely,relevant information.This willnot necessarily emerge spontaneouslybecause it depends on comparable assess-ments across schools.Policymakers couldpublicize that a speciﬁc school meets mini-mum standards through easily visible infor-mation tools,such as symbols prominentlydisplayed in the school.A more sophisti-cated approach could involve broadly dis-seminated census-like information on out-puts and outcomes—perhaps normalizedby socioeconomic status.Making choice part ofa package ofreforms.The public sector always remains an impor-tant provider,and choice complementsreforms to improve the public sector.Advo-cates ofschool choice emphasize the poten-tial beneﬁcial effects ofcompetition—forwhich there is mixed evidence.But there areother elements as well.Choice as part ofapackage ofreforms can have three beneﬁts:•The introduction ofchoice forces anunbundling ofroles.To have effectivechoice the government must be explicitin its dual role ofsetting the rules for allproviders and managing schools as thelargest provider.•Deciding how to regulate private providerscan force a discussion ofthe output andoutcome goals ofeducation that canimprove accountability in all schools.•And choice often creates new acceptance ofassessments for monitoring providers—which can be expanded to all schools.Designing choice around the politics.Pol-icy decisions about choice are intrinsicallypolitical.The United States prohibits publicsupport to schools run by religious organi-zations.Cordoba,Argentina,has activelysupported Catholic schools.343Hollandexplicitly supports both Catholic andProtestant schools.Rather than being basedon the perceived relative effectiveness ofthedifferent schools,these policy choices seemto reﬂect differing public opinion at thetime the decisions were taken—for exam-ple,historical concern about Catholic inﬂu-ence among the Protestant majority in theUnited States,a predominantly Catholicpopulation in Cordoba,and a more evendistribution ofreligions in Holland.Simi-larly,the suppression ofIslamic schools insome countries and support for them inothers,or the decision to ban privateschools in Pakistan and Nigeria in the1970s,has little to do with school effective-ness.The promotion ofchoice throughvouchers in the Czech Republic has beenseen as a reaction to the use ofschools forpolitical indoctrination.Ifschool choice is a political given,aneffective school system can be designedaround that constraint.Ifschool choice ispolitically precluded,an effective school sys-tem can be designed around that as well.Getting reform goingThis chapter is about changing the relation-ships ofaccountability to produce bettereducational outcomes by creating the insti-128WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 200415_WDR_Ch07.qxd  8/14/03  9:27 AM  Page 128(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

tutional conditions for the technically rightthings to happen.But how can institutionsbe changed? How do openings for reformget created and exploited? Decentralizationcan create opportunities.Reform champi-ons can emerge from political,business,professional,or parental interests.Andteacher groups can promote—or resist—change.DecentralizationDecentralization can be driven by a desireto move services closer to people.But suc-cess depends on how it affects relation-ships ofaccountability.Ifdecentralizationjust replaces the functions ofthe centralministry with a slightly lower tier ofgov-ernment (a province or state),but every-thing else about the environment remainsthe same—compact,management,andclient power—there is little reason toexpect positive change.The assumption isthat decentralization works by enhancingcitizens’political voice in a way that resultsin improved services.But this could goeither way on both theoretical and empiri-cal grounds.Decentralization is not magic.It must reach the classroom.And it willwork only to the extent that it createsgreater opportunities for school reform(chapter 10).Reform championsGetting education reform on the agenda isno mean feat,and getting reform politicallysupported and implemented is even moredifﬁcult.While individual parents are pow-erful advocates for their children,that doesnot necessarily translate into systemimprovement.Educators and progressiveforces among teachers often emerge aschampions ofeducation reform becausethey are most acquainted with the prob-lems inside the classroom and school.But itis much easier to mobilize educator sup-port for certain types ofeducation reforms(system expansion,increased resources,pedagogy improvement,technical curricu-lar reform) than others (increasedchoice).344Local or national politicians or tech-nocrats can also be forces for educationreform,particularly ifthey perceive it isstrongly linked to economic performance.But it is much easier to mobilize technocraticpolicymaker support for certain types ofedcuation reform (narrow accountability)than others (pedagogical improvement).Teachers and teachers’unions.Effectiveteachers are the backbone ofany educa-tional system,but how can the power ofteachers be harnessed for educationalimprovement? Some believe that teachershave too little power,arguing that educa-tional reforms ignore teachers.Followedthrough,this view can lead to reforms thatignore classroom and school-level realities,further demoralizing teachers and under-mining reforms.Others believe that teach-ers,especially teachers’unions,have toomuch power and focus exclusively onwages and working conditions (box 7.8).Both sides can marshal empirical evidence.Much ofthe debate stems from the jointfunction ofteachers’unions as profes-sional organizations,which exist to pro-mote efﬁcacy,advance professional knowl-edge,and advocate views in public policy;and as agents ofcollective bargaining,which emphasize resources and workingconditions.Basic education services129Reforms to promote greater parentalinvolvement,more school autonomy,moreemphasis on results,and changes in thetraining,selection,assignment,andcompensation of teachers are politicallyexplosive—particularly with teachers’unions.A study of ﬁve attempts at educa-tion reforms that included many of theseelements in Latin America in the 1990sfound that teachers’unions opposed nearlyall of them—emphatically and stridently.“Teacher’s unions in Mexico,MinasGerais,Brazil,Bolivia,Nicaragua,and Ecuadorfollowed similar strategies in opposing edu-cation reform.All used strikes to assert theirpower ...against unwanted changes.Thepower to disrupt public life,to close downschools and ministries,to stop trafﬁc in capi-tal cities,to appeal to public opinion—werefamiliar actions to them.”In April 1999 theannouncement by the Bolivian Ministry ofEducation of its intention to transfer teachercolleges to public universities set teachersand students at those colleges “rioting in thestreets,breaking windows,attacking police,throwing rocks,and setting cars on ﬁre”(images the government used to mobilizepublic opinion against the unions).Teachers’unions wanted governments toaddress the issues of teachers’wages andworking conditions and were concerned thatdecentralization and school autonomy wouldintrude on more familiar relationships andnegotiations between a centralized schooladministration and a centralized union.Even when governments pushedreforms through,conﬂicts with the unionsmade implementation problematic,sincesuccessful reform requires teacher partici-pation.Source:Grindle (forthcoming).BOX 7.8Education reform and teachers’unions in LatinAmerica15_WDR_Ch07.qxd  8/14/03  9:28 AM  Page 129(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

In too many countries discussionsbetween the government and teachers’unions are no different from discussionsbetween a large company and its unions.Therelationship between policymakers andteachers’organizations needs to shift from apure bargaining game to a positive-sumgame.This is easier said than done.As profes-sional development bodies teachers’unions130WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004can reinforce professional ethics and mutualaccountability.They can be used to organizeteacher input on technical issues ofeduca-tional reform,such as assessment,classroomautonomy,student discipline,and teachertraining.Ifunions refuse to take on that role,preferring to concentrate on wages and work-ing conditions,there are no ﬁrm guidelinesfor how reformers should cope with that.15_WDR_Ch07.qxd  8/14/03  9:28 AM  Page 130(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

community schools,bearing the cost them-selves and paying teachers when they could.The government seized on this model ofcommunity-based schooling as the basis fora formal program that would be ﬁnanciallyand administratively supported by the min-istry:Educación con Participación de laComunidad,or Educo,with the goal ofencouraging the establishment ofpreschoolsand primary schools,or classrooms in exist-ing schools.Begun in 1991,Educo targeted 78 ofthecountry’s poorest rural municipalities (of221 urban and rural municipalities).By 1993the program was expanding to all ruralareas,including many areas formerly underopposition control.But not all ofthe “popu-lar schools”established during the war wereincorporated into Educo.Some observersclaimed there was selective inclusion basedon political favoritism;others saw not incor-porating popularschools into a governmentprogram as a way ofsustaining spontaneouscommunity-based education.350Each Educoschool (or section within atraditional school) is operated by a Com-munity Education Association (ACE)—anelected committee made up primarily ofstudents’parents—that enters into a one-year renewable agreement with the min-istry.The agreement outlines rights,responsibilities,and ﬁnancial transfers.TheMinistry ofEducation oversees basic policyand technical design.Using the moneydirectly transferred to them,ACEs select,hire,monitor,and retain or dismiss teach-ers.Teachers at Educoschools are hired onone-year renewable contracts.Parents aretaught about school management and howto assist their children at home.351Three-quarters of new enrollmentsEducosucceeded in many respects.From apilot phase ofsix ACEs in three depart-ments,it scaled up nationally to all ofthecountry’s departments by 1993.Rural pri-mary enrollments increased from 476,000in 1992 to 555,000 in 1995—with over 75El Salvador was wracked by civil warthroughout the 1980s.Some 80,000people died—in a total populationofroughly 5 million—and many more werewounded and disabled.Income per capitafell almost 40 percent between 1978 and1983.345In 1989 the conservative Republi-can Alliance Party won a majority in thenational assembly,with Alfredo Cristiani aspresident.Despite contentious negotia-tions,a peace accord was signed in January1992.346The war had severely damaged the edu-cation system.Communication betweenthe central ministry and schools brokedown,supervision collapsed,and manyteachers,viewed by some as government“agents”and by others as agents ofsocialopposition,abandoned their posts.By 1988more than a third ofthe country’s primaryschools had closed.347And by the end ofthewar some 1 million children were not inschool.348Establishing Educo—Education with the Participation of CommunitiesThe Ministry ofEducation quickly identi-ﬁed expanding access to basic educationand raising its quality as central goals—both to rebuild national unity and to pro-mote long-term economic development.Minister ofEducation Cecilia Gallardo deCano,a reform proponent from the “mod-ernizing”wing ofthe Republican AllianceParty,was intent on lessening the distrustbetween former combatants.But skepticism was high.The MinistryofEducation was not trusted in many partsofthe country and by organized groupssuch as the National Association ofTeach-ers.Expansion ofthe traditional educationsystem was viewed suspiciously as a covertmeans ofreasserting national control andbuilding political support in opposition-dominated areas.349During the war many communities hadrecruited local teachers and establishedpercent ofthe new students enrolled inEducoschools (ﬁgure 1).By 2001 therewere almost 260,000 students enrolled inEducoprimary schools,41 percent ofallstudents enrolled in rural schools—andmore than 100,000 children enrolled inEducopreschools,57 percent ofall childrenin preschool.Even as enrollments increased rapidly,there is little evidence that learning qualitysuffered.A survey of30 Educoprimaryschools and 101 traditional schools in 1996found no signiﬁcant differences in averagemath and language test scores among thirdgraders in the two types ofschools.352A fol-low-up study in 1998 found that grade pro-motion and repetition were similar acrossthe two types ofschools as well.353As theinnovation matured,the institutionalarrangements that it introduced took holdand ensured rapid expansion ofschoolplaces and enrollments ofpoor children,seemingly without a substantial cost inquality.354Parent visits to classrooms made muchofthe differenceThat Educoschools served the poorest ofElSalvador’s students,in the poorest areas,makes these results all the more astonish-ing.How did they do it? Using retrospectivedata that allow controls for child,house-hold,teacher,and school characteristics—Educación con Participación de la Comunidad en El SalvadorBy contracting directly with communities,El Salvador dramatically increased the primary school enrollment ofchildrenin poor and remote areas—without reducing the quality oflearning.Educospotlight on Figure 1Students enrolled in traditional ruraland in Educo primary classes01990199219941996199820002002300400100200500600700Thousands of studentsTraditionalEducoNote:Figures for 2002 are estimates.Source: El Salvador Ministry of Education.16_pgs 131-132_Ch07Spot.qxd  8/14/03  3:28 PM  Page 131(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

132Spotlight on Educothat teachers were less likely to be absent inEducoschools (averaging 1.2 days ofabsence a month rather than 1.4 days).Stu-dents in Educoschools were also absent less(three fewer days a month) than students intraditional schools.356In addition,Educo’smore ﬂexible compensation schemeresulted in greater variability in teacherearnings,which suggests that parent associ-ations used compensation to motivategreater effort among teachers.357Offeringor withholding future employment itselfwas an incentive,and one that ACEs used.Turnover among Educo teachers was high,which suggests that job loss was not an idlethreat.Converging with traditionalschoolsEduco’s administration has becomeembedded in the Ministry ofEducation,and Educohas developed into a majorschooling model in the country.Aspects oftraditional and Educoschools have beenconverging.Traditional schools now havemore parent participation in school gover-nance and management,and are moreautonomous with supporting blockﬁnancing.Similarly,the pay packages ofteachers are more similar:Educoteachersreceive the same salaries and beneﬁts asteachers in traditional schools.Even so,akey distinction remains:Educoteachersare hired (and potentially ﬁred) by parentcommittees while those in traditionalschools are not.and statistically adjusting for the fact thatunobserved abilities ofchildren might sys-tematically differ between the two types ofschools—researchers found that commu-nity involvement explains much ofEduco’ssuccess.Parents are more active in Educoschools.And their involvement affectslearning (ﬁgure 2).Each classroom visit byparents was associated with signiﬁcantlyhigher math and language test scoresregardless ofthe type ofschool.Parentswere more active informally as well:theywere more likely to meet with teachers or toassist teachers in monitoring attendance ormaintaining school furniture.355How did Educoand parent involvementaffect test scores? At least part ofthe story isIs the Educo model applicable elsewhere?Educo’s achievements might appear idio-syncratic.The end ofa bloody civil war thathad thrown the traditional education sys-tem into chaos opened up a unique oppor-tunity to change the way schools were man-aged.Based in part on coping strategiesduring the civil war,El Salvador had a his-tory ofcommunity involvement in schoolmanagement.Indeed,the community asso-ciations appear to have worked better inplaces that had prior experience in commu-nity organization.358In addition,in theaftermath ofthe war there was an unusuallylarge pool ofeducated people without jobs(coinciding with the rapid expansion ofuniversity places fueled by opening highereducation to the private sector).These factors suggest that the Educomodel might not be directly replicable in adifferent setting.But some lessons are gen-eral.First,with political will it is possible tochange the relationships between the actorsin basic education.Second,schools can betransformed to work in ways that promoteenrollment,participation,and learning—even for children from the poorest house-holds.Third,getting parents to participateeffectively in managing schools can helpovercome some ofthe potential pitfalls inthe provision ofeducation services—espe-cially monitoring schooling in remoteareas.Fourth,it is possible to scale up smallinnovations to have a signiﬁcant impact onnational outcomes.Figure 2Educo promoted parent involvement,which boosted test scores0TraditionalschoolsEducoschools5.7432156Number of visits1.60MathLanguage5.7432156Percent increaseParent visits to classrooms in previous monthIncrease in test scoresassociated with a visit3.8Source: Adapted from Jimenez and Sawada (1999).16_pgs 131-132_Ch07Spot.qxd  8/14/03  3:28 PM  Page 132(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

133Poor people in most countries have the worsthealth outcomes.They are pushed furtherinto poverty due to ill health.And they areoften excluded from support networks thatenhance the social and economic beneﬁts ofgood health.Unlike education,health andnutrition outcomes ofpoor people are pro-duced by households—with contributionsfrom many services.And health and nutri-tion services contribute to other aspects ofhuman welfare,such as protecting peoplefrom catastrophic health spending.Theyshould thus be judged by the way they con-tribute to the poor’s health outcomes,to pro-tecting citizens from impoverishing healthexpenditures,and to helping the poor breakout oftheir social exclusion.Throughout history,poor people haveoften paid health providers directly.But thisshort route from client to provider isblunted by asymmetries ofinformation andconﬂicts ofinterest.Another problem:poorpeople lack the money for market transac-tions.A variety ofmarket failures—disease-related externalities and fragmented insur-ance markets—and concerns for equityjustify public intervention in ﬁnancinghealth and nutrition services.But govern-ments ﬁnd it difﬁcult to monitor the per-formance ofhealth workers,especiallythose delivering highly discretionary ser-vices,such as clinical care.And since insur-ance-market failures affect everybody,thenon-poor often capture public ﬁnancing ofhealth care.Health services are failing poor peoplenot because oflack ofknowledge for pre-venting and treating illnesses but becausehealth systems are trapped in a web offailedrelationships ofaccountability.To break outofthis trap,service delivery arrangementscan be tailored for three classes ofservices:•Getting highly transaction-intensive anddiscretionary individual-oriented clini-calservices to poor people is most chal-lenging.To inﬂuence quality,poor clientsshould have greater power—throughthird-party payments,information,andgreater oversight ofhealth workers andfacilities.Organized citizens can exertthis power by contributing ﬁnancialresources and co-producing and moni-toring the services.But insurance marketfailures,asymmetries ofknowledge,andconﬂicts ofinterest mean that govern-ments need to invest in purchasing keyservices to protect poor households andfoster a pro-poor professional ethos.•Population-oriented outreachservices—standardized services that can include vec-tor control,immunization,or vitamin Asupplementation—are easier for policy-makers to monitor.Even governmentswith limited capacity can provide theseservices—or write contracts with publicor private entities to provide them.Build-ing coalitions to strengthen poor people’scollective voice is essential to ensure ade-quate public resources for those services.•For community andfamily-orientedservicesthat support self-care—such asinformation and social support for pro-moting breastfeeding or safe sex—com-munity and civil society organizationsand commercial networks are often wellplaced to provide services close to poorhouseholds.Governments can establishpartnerships and provide informationand targeted subsidies.Policymakers need to be accountable forhealth outcomes—which means greater invest-ment in monitoring and evaluation mecha-nisms that capture disparities in health.359Health and nutrition services8chapter17_WDR_Ch08.qxd  8/14/03  9:44 AM  Page 133(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

The health of poor peopleHealth outcomes improved in the secondhalfofthe 20th century,a trend likely tocontinue in many countries.But hopes foran ever-improving trend are fading asprogress slowed down in the 1990s.At thecurrent pace most regions ofthe developingworld will not reach the Millennium Devel-opment Goals for health by 2015 (ﬁgure8.1).Infant mortality rates are increasing inCentral Asia.Under-ﬁve mortality is on therise in 22 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.Stunting is rising in many African countriesand remains high in South Asia.In 1995,500,000 women died worldwide as a resultofcomplications associated with pregnancy,mostly in developing countries.The AIDSepidemic is expanding in Africa,India,China,and Russia,along with a resurgenceoftuberculosis.360Adult mortality rates haveworsened in the Russian Federation andsome ofits neighbors.The outcomes are consistently worseamong the disadvantaged.In low-and mid-dle-income countries,under-ﬁve mortalityrates are 2.3 times higher among the poorestﬁfth ofthe population than among the rich-est ﬁfth.Stunting rates are 3.4 times higher(ﬁgure 8.2).361The rich fare well in absoluteterms.In Pelotas,Brazil,infant mortality forthe richest 7 percent ofthe population in1993 was comparable to the average for theNetherlands in 1998.362Communicable diseases,malnutrition,and reproductive ailments account for mostofthe mortality gap between high- andlow-income countries and between the richand poor.363The poor also often suffer fromhigher rates ofnoncommunicable diseasessuch as depression and cardiovascular dis-eases in North America or alcohol-relatedailments in the Russian Federation.Malnu-trition is a double burden:poorest groupshave both high rates ofmalnutrition anddiabetes and obesity.364Improving health outcomes for the pooris a complex task.In addition to income,other household factors inﬂuence health out-comes:age,social status,religion,residence(chapter 1),ethnic background (box 8.1),andgender—particularly in South Asia.Girls inIndia are 30 to 50 percent more likely to diebetween the age ofone and ﬁve than boys.365Maternal mortality depends mainly on healthservices while nutrition and under-ﬁve mor-tality depend on many other services,such aseducation,water,food security,communica-tion,electriﬁcation,and transportation.TheAIDS epidemic has particularly challengedpolicymakers and providers to look at linkswith other sectors and focus more on behav-ior and societal values.Health services can work for poor peopleExperience from Brazil,Chile,Costa Ricaand Cuba (spotlight),Iran (box 8.2),Nepal,Matlab (Bangladesh),Tanzania,and severalWest African countries (spotlight) showsthat health services,ifdelivered well,canimprove outcomes for even the poorestgroups.A health program in the Gadchirolidistrict in India reduced neonatal mortalityrates by 62 percent.Midwifery services andcommunity hospitals are linked to dramaticreductions in neonatal and maternal mor-tality in Sri Lanka and Malaysia.In Ugandaand Thailand government efforts changedsexual behavior,reducing the prevalence ofHIV.In low- and middle-income countriesservices promoting oral rehydration therapyled to a decrease in diarrhea-related childmortality.366Health services also help protect the incomeofthe poor.Locally managed ﬁnancingschemes in Niger,contracted-out services inCambodia,and insurance schemes targetingpoor people in Thailand and Indonesia helpedreduce out-of-pocket spending and extendedthe reach ofthe safety net among the poor.367134WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Figure 8.1Reaching the MDGs in health: accelerate progressTrends in under-ﬁve mortality by region0197019852000201510050200150250Deaths per thousandSub-Saharan

Health services,when they work,can alsocontribute to greater self-reliance and socialinclusion ofpoor people.They have been usedas entry points to broader development activi-ties,as in the Democratic Republic ofCongo,where community health ﬁnancing schemestriggered the emergence ofcooperatives tocommercialize agricultural products.368But those who need the most oftenget the least ...Despite these successes the availability ofgoodhealth services tends to vary inversely withneed.369Poor groups and regions have lessaccess to sanitation and vector control.370Ananalysis of30 countries shows that the use ofhealth care interventions is consistently loweramong people living on less than $1 a day thanamong richer groups (ﬁgures 8.3 and 8.4)....pay the most ...Illness pushes households into poverty,through lost wages,high spending for cata-strophic illnesses,and repeated treatment forother illnesses.The share ofhousehold non-food expenditures spent on health is higheramong poorer than richer groups.Patientssell assets to ﬁnance health care,as 45 per-cent ofrural patients do in the KyrgyzRepublic.371Health expenses are estimated tohave pushed almost 3 million Vietnameseinto poverty in 1998.Out-of-pocket spend-ing pushes poor households deeper intopoverty,but it also pushes households thatwere not poor into extreme poverty.Thepoor seldom enroll in voluntary insuranceschemes and rarely beneﬁt from compulsoryschemes.Even when they do,they still incursigniﬁcant direct health care costs in theform ofinsurance premiums,copayments,and payments for noncovered services.372...and lack the power to producegood health Poor nutrition practices,careless handling ofwater and waste,and inadequate care for ill-ness are major contributors to poor health.Illiteracy,women’s ignorance ofhealth issues,and lack ofdecisionmaking power are oftenthe causes (ﬁgure 8.5).373Studies ofthe rich-poor gap in health outcomes show that thepoor and the non-poor may respond to thesame level ofinputs differently.374In Senegalthe poor are 39 percent less efﬁcient than therich at translating drinking water,sanitation,and health services into better health.In Mali,the poor are only 16 percent less efﬁcient,butthe gap has been widening over time:whilethe availability ofinputs is increasing,poorhouseholds’ability to transform those inputsinto health is lagging behind.Health and nutrition services13501020Percent304050GhanaKazakhstanMoroccoPeruTurkeyPoorest fifthRichest fifthSecond richestMiddle fifthSecond poorestSource:Analysis of Demographic and Health Surveys, 1990–2002.Figure 8.2Reaching the MDGs in health: focus onpoor householdsStunting prevalence among children 3–5 years old, bywealth groupIn 1974 the infant mortality rate in Iran was120 per 1,000 live births for rural areas and62 in urban areas.By 2000 it stood at 28 forurban areas and 30 for rural areas.Maternalmortality rates dropped in rural areas from370 per 100,000 to 55 between 1974 and1996.Immunization rates,treatment of childillnesses,and antenatal care increased dra-matically and are now at comparably highlevels in rural and urban areas,althoughskilled attendance for deliveries remainslower (75 percent) in rural areas than inurban (95 percent).All this,despite the factthat 76 percent of rural children had nohealth insurance in 1997 and 56 percent ofrural women were still illiterate.How did this happen? In 1980,after theIranian revolution,a new constitutionbound the government to provide basichealth beneﬁts to the “disadvantaged”(mostazafeen).The most immediate concernwas to increase access to care in rural areas.Allocations of resources for rural servicesincreased and today are about a third of thehealth budget in the rural regions.By March2002 there were 16,340 rural health houses,each covering about 1,500 people,servingabout 84 percent of rural communities.Therest were covered by mobile teams.Healthcenters offering emergency obstetrical care24 hours a day (three midwives) and trans-port for referral were created coveringabout 20,000 people each.Despite the large number of medicalprofessionals in Iran,stafﬁng these facilitieswas a challenge because personnel did notreadily accept posting to rural areas.Thehealth houses were therefore staffed byfemale and male health workers known asbehvarz.Selected from the villages wherethey were to be stationed,with the partici-pation of village authorities,the behvarzwere required to have eight years of formalschooling.Their training lasted two years,was mainly local,and consisted of on-the-job training with supervisors and peer train-ers.A simple health information system—the Vital Horoscope—enabled behvarz toidentify families with child and maternalhealth problems and link them with healthservices.Source:Mehryar,Aghajanian,and Ahmadnia(2003).BOX 8.2Making health services work for poor people inthe Islamic Republic ofIran17_WDR_Ch08.qxd  8/14/03  9:45 AM  Page 135(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Market failures and government failuresMarket failures and a concern for equity callfor some government ﬁnancing ofhealthand nutrition services.One type ofmarketfailure is the underprovision ofservices toprevent or treat individual illnesses that spillover to the general populace.Another is thebreakdown in insurance and credit markets,impoverishing people.375The concern forequity is either a social choice or based onthe notion that health is a human right (seebox 2.2).Conﬂicts ofinterest and the capacity ofservices to do serious harm also justify gov-ernment involvement in service provision.Patients ﬁnd it difﬁcult to attribute theirhealth status to a speciﬁc course ofaction.This makes them imperfect judges ofhealthproviders.Although responsiveness topatients’needs is often better in the privatesector,the technical quality ofprivate ser-vices varies broadly from very good to verybad (chapter 4).The technical complexity ofclinical services confers considerable poweron providers to inﬂuence the nature andquantity ofservices they provide—to theirown ﬁnancial beneﬁt.This is well illustratedby recent increases in caesarian sections inboth high- and low-income countries.376Governments often aim at solving con-ﬂicts ofinterest through direct service pro-vision with tight administrative control andenforcement ofa public ethos.But monitor-ing whether services are actually deliveredand ofadequate quality may be difﬁcult.These “bureaucratic”failures are particu-larly high for highly discretionary and trans-action-intensive services such as diagnosingand treating an illness.Absenteeism rates inhealth clinics is high377(chapter 1) andalthough technical quality ofservices isoften slightly better in public than in privateservices,quality shortcomings are still ram-pant in the public sector.In Tunisia in 1996only 20 percent ofpneumonia cases weremanaged correctly and 62 percent ofcasesreceived antibiotics inappropriately.378Governments also address failed insur-ance markets by running “free”public hos-pitals.The beneﬁciaries ofthese hospitalservices are usually the non-poor in urbanareas (chapter 2).They use their politicalclout to ensure that public spending forthese (expensive) hospitals is maintained—often at the expense ofservices that couldhave a real effect on poor people.Many health services are private goods,and all countries have a private health caremarket.Most industrial countries startedwith private health systems.In low- andmiddle-income countries out-of-pocketspending represents a large share ofhealthspending even in countries with well-functioning public systems (ﬁgure 8.6).Andin the last 20 years there has been tremendousgrowth in private provision (often uncon-trolled) and private spending on health.379Worldwide,richer groups generallyresort more to the private sector,but the sit-136WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Figure 8.3Poor people use high-impact services lessSource:Authors’ calculations, based on Demographic and Health Survey data,weighted average for 30 low- and middle-income countries.0204080Percent of population below and above$1 poverty line using health services60Belowpoverty lineAbovepoverty lineUse of oralrehydration therapy ComplementaryfeedingAntenatal careDPT3 coverage ratesSkilled delivery careTreatment for ARIFigure 8.4Richer groups do well in absolute termsSource:Gwatkin and others (2000), Demographic and Health Survey data,weighted average for 30 low- and middle-income countries.02040100Percent of births attended by skilled personnel60Poorest fifthRichest fifth80PhilippinesGuatemalaEgyptCameroonZambiaIndonesiaTurkeyIndia17_WDR_Ch08.qxd  8/14/03  9:46 AM  Page 136(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

uation differs by country.Richer groupsalso use public facilities more—which indi-cates that subsidies are not well targeted.The public-private mix varies by type ofservice (ﬁgure 8.7).The private sector isinvolved in many critical services,includingdisease control and child and reproductivehealth.But immunizations,family plan-ning,and skilled delivery care are moreoften provided by the public sector.Even inIndia,poor people,who turn mainly to pri-vate providers to treat illnesses,rely on thepublic sector for vaccination (93 percent)and antenatal care (74 percent).380The boundaries between public and pri-vate services have blurred.Many govern-ments subsidize privately provided ser-vices—all high-income countries do and so,Health and nutrition services137Figure 8.5aPoor women do not know much about HIV02040100Percent of women who have knowledgeof sexual transmission of HIV/AIDS,by wealth group6080Richest fifthPoorest fifthIndiaBoliviaComorosGuatemalaIndonesiaMadagascarMaliTurkeyPeruSenegalTanzaniaSource:Authors’ calculations from Demographic and HealthSurvey data, 1995–2002.Figure 8.5bHusbands say no to contraception02040100Percent of women who reportedtheir husbands do not approve ofcontraceptive use, by wealth group6080Richest fifthPoorest fifthCentral AfricanRepublicUgandaNamibiaCote d’IvoireˆPhilippinesBangladeshKenyaPeruTanzaniaTurkeyBoliviaSource:Authors’ calculations from Demographic and HealthSurvey data, 1995–2002.Figure 8.6A public responsibility, but private spending matters020406080100Europe and Central AsiaLatin America and CaribbeanSub-Saharan AfricaMiddle EastEast AsiaSouth AsiaHigh incomeUpper middle incomeLower middle incomeLow income020406080100TurkmenistanGeorgiaGuatemalaMexicoCameroonMozambiqueEgyptSaudi ArabiaMalaysiaCambodiaIndiaBangladeshPercent of public and private expenditures on health as a proportion of total spendingPrivate (out-of-pocket)By incomeand regionsPrivate(pooled)PublicSelectedcountriesSource:WHO (World Health Organization) (1999), National Health Accounts, updated 2002.17_WDR_Ch08.qxd  8/14/03  9:46 AM  Page 137(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

increasingly,do middle- and low-incomecountries,as in the Thai Social SecurityScheme,Poland’s social insurance system,and Uganda’s subsidies to not-for-proﬁt pro-viders.Many public facilities charge user fees,introducing a market-like transaction in thedelivery ofpublic services,381and poor peo-ple spend substantial sums to use them.382There has also been widespread growth ininformal payments to public providers inAfrica,East Asia,and Eastern Europe,383which represents an informal marketizationofpublic services.Informal payments boostthe cost of“free”maternity care in Bangladeshto $31 for a normal delivery—a quarter ofahousehold’s average monthly income—andto $118 for a caesarian section.384Applying the framework: classes ofservicesChapters 3 through 6 developed a frame-work for analyzing service delivery that iden-tiﬁes two routes for poor people to obtainservices.One is the short route,where clients138WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Figure 8.7The public-private mix differs between poor and rich, and among interventions 2040608010010080604020020406080100100806040200KazakhstanKyrgyzstanUzbekistanTurkeyEurope, Central AsiaCambodiaIndonesiaPhilippinesVietnamEast Asia, PacificBoliviaBrazilDominican RepublicGuatemalaHaitiNicaraguaPeruLatin America, CaribbeanEgyptMoroccoYemenMiddle East, North AfricaBangladeshIndiaNepalPakistanSouth AsiaBeninCameroonEthiopiaGhanaMadagascarMozambiqueUgandaZambiaSub-Saharan AfricaRichest fifthPoorest fifthRichest fifthPublic and private facility delivery ratesPublic and private facility treatment rates for acute respiratory infectionPoorest fifthProportion of births attended in a health facilityProportion of children with fever and coughwho, within 2 weeks, are seen medicallyPrivatePublicPublicPrivateSource:Authors, based on Demographic and Health Survey data 1995–2002.17_WDR_Ch08.qxd  8/14/03  9:46 AM  Page 138(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

exert power over providers by dint oftheirmoney and ability to enforce discipline.Theother is the long route ofpublic accountabil-ity from poor clients to policymakers,andfrom policymakers to providers.For healthservices,the short route often fails because ofconﬂicts ofinterest and asymmetries ininformation.Poor people also lack moneyfor market transactions.But the complexityofservices and the heterogeneity ofhealthneeds make it difﬁcult to standardize serviceprovision and to monitor performance—amajor “bureaucratic”failure ofthe longroute ofaccountability.Lack ofvoice ofthepoor in decisions over the use ofthe collec-tive purse is another failure ofthe long route.Clinical servicesare highly discretionaryand transaction-intensive,requiring indi-vidually tailored diagnostics and treatments.So one leg ofthe long route,which requiresthe policymaker to monitor the provider,isdifﬁcult.Yet failures in the insurance marketcall for government involvement in high-cost services,such as inpatient services orcatastrophic illnesses.But often these gov-ernment-ﬁnanced,high-cost services bene-ﬁt primarily the non-poor.So the other legofthe long route (voice) also fails.Thismeans that poor people have to revert to theshort route ofdirect client purchases ofaservice.But the asymmetry ofinformationbetween the client and the provider—andthe client’s lack ofmoney—cause this routeto fail too.A quandary!The task is slightly easier for services thatsupport self-careby families and communi-ties,such as information to support changesin nutritional or sexual behavior.This ser-vice is discretionary because it has to be tai-lored to the family’s social environment,butit requires less intensive professional trans-action than services responding to individ-ual illness.Short- and long-route failuresare small.Some professional services,despite beingtechnical and transaction-intensive,are alsowell standardized and less discretionary.Such services include those that serve homo-geneous needs ofa population—such as vec-tor control,immunization,supplementationwith vitamin A,or screening for diabetes.These population-orientedservices can bedelivered through outreach to the poor.When health interventions have large exter-nalities such as communicable diseases con-trol,the short-market-like route is unlikelyto work.Iftechnology allows standardiza-tion,this delivery arrangement is then theprime choice as policymakers can monitorperformance and tightly control delivery.Technology is constantly evolving,and nointervention belongs automatically to onecategory (box 8.3).Service delivery ap-proaches are continually being developedthat reduce the need and difﬁculty ofmoni-toring for both government and citizens.Countries have standardized highly technicalinterventions into less discretionary servicesHealth and nutrition services139Throughout the 20th century,service institutionshave responded—albeit slowly—to rapidchanges in health technology.Countries choosecombinations of “delivery modes”based on costsand international standards but also on country-speciﬁc characteristics such as geographic anddensity constraints,transport and infrastructurecapacity,existing health infrastructure inheritedfrom previous technological innovations,labormarket characteristics,training and orientation ofproviders,and so forth.What is delivered as inpa-tient treatment,outpatient hospital,health centeror home visits;and what by lay people,nurses,general practitioners,or specialists is far frombeing standard across countries.•Technological progresstriggers modiﬁcationsin the nature,type,and quantity of servicesrequired.Hospital tuberculosis treatment(the sanatorium) was replaced by outpatientclinical care—thanks to antibiotics .Screen-ing followed by treatment—DOTS (DirectlyObserved Treatment Therapy)—were laterstandardized to allow delivery through com-munity outreach.Similarly,new treatmentsfor HIV and cancer cut lengthy hospitaliza-tion requirements.The care and curefunctions of the hospital also evolve.Hospi-tals are being transformed into long-term-care centers for the elderly,while complexprocedures are increasingly conducted inambulatory clinics.Home-based nursing careis being revived.•At similar levels of technology countries haveopted for different models with comparable lev-els of success.Independent practitionersdeveloped ﬁrst in Western countries and havebeen the cornerstone of Western systems.Thehegemony of hospitals in the Western worldis no older than the 20th century.In contrast,hospitals have played a much larger role inthe provision of outpatient care in EasternEurope and Central Asia,and in Latin America,Vietnam,and Sri Lanka.In Africa health sys-tems developed through hospitals andmobile clinics since the beginning of the 20thcentury,with primary health care emergingonly in the 1980s.Different skill levels are alsoused for similar interventions.Health techni-cians and nurses have been successfully usedin Mozambique to perform caesariansections,while other countries use generalpractioners or skilled obstetricians.BOX 8.3The changing mix ofcure and

that can be initiated,controlled,and deliv-ered by the government through reachingout to the poor.Such interventions can beaddressed to population groups with simi-lar needs.Another way is to reduce thetransaction intensity ofservices—and theneed for government monitoring—byempowering poor people to drive servicesthat correspond to their needs and charac-teristics (ﬁgure 8.8).Table 8.1 presents some ofthe key obsta-cles limiting the coverage ofthe poor withregard to health and nutrition services.Poor access to information and to networksdistributing health-related commodities is amajor impediment to the use ofcommu-nity- and family-oriented support to self-care.Rural populations often have no accessto retail condoms,soap,water containers orbed nets.Ifthey do,price remains a barrier.Fewer than 30 percent ofthe poorest ﬁfth ofthe population have access to the media insuch countries as Bolivia,India,Morocco,and Mozambique.Few poor householdsreceive extension workers,with visits peak-ing at 20 percent ofIndonesian and Peru-vian households .Most countries have had some success inincreasing the physical access ofpoor com-munities to some population-oriented ser-vices—witness the universal childhoodimmunization,polio eradication efforts,and the elimination ofonchocerciasis.Egypt and Mexico have successful itinerantclinics.But sustaining these efforts for thepoor is problematic.Low demand and poorquality reduce effectiveness offamily plan-ning services in India.Governments cancontrol and monitor such services easily,but they often underinvest in them.In tran-sition countries in Europe and Asia,movingfrom publicly provided services to socialinsurance led to confusion about the gov-ernment’s role in health,which led to theneglect ofthese services and the subsequentre-emergence ofcommunicable diseases.Low-income countries have difﬁcultyensuring physical access to clinical servicesfor a large part oftheir population.In Chadonly 20 percent ofthe poorest ﬁfth live lessthan one hour from a health facility.Middle-income countries have more trouble ensur-ing affordable and quality care to excluded,vulnerable,and difﬁcult-to-reach segmentsofthe population.Inequitable risk poolingstill leaves the poor exposed to the ﬁnancialrisk ofillness in most ofthese countries.Studies report large inefﬁciencies in the wayhealth facilities are run.In Turkey,a studyfound that only 54 of573 general hospi-140WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Figure 8.8Making health services easier to deliver, through standardization and empowerment EmpowermentSupport to self-carefamily-orientedInformation campaigns, social marketing of insecticide-treated netsCommunity mobilization for HIV, community DOTSPeer support for breastfeeding, food forticationRetail contraceptives,community information forbirth spacingPeer support for home care for child illnessesInitiated by the clientInitiated by the policymakerComplex intervention: highdiscretion, transaction intensive,high asymmetry of information,heterogeneous needsStandardizationOutreachpopulation-orientedVector control or presumptive intermittent treatmentSystematic HIV or TB screeningMicronutrient supplementationAntenatal screening, tetanus toxoidChild immunizationClinical servicesindividual-orientedMedical treatment of a malaria caseTreatment of opportunistic infections including TBNutritional rehabilitationEssential obstetrical careMedical treatment of pneumoniaMalariaHIV and TBNutritionReproductive healthChild health17_WDR_Ch08.qxd  8/14/03  9:47 AM  Page 140(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Strengthening client powerThese are our people.This is our money,you can-not touch it.President ofBenin’s Health Committees,responding to the Ministry ofHealth’s attempt to centralize community-owned health funds and return them to the TreasuryStrengthening client power can improveservices for the poor by substituting for orcorrecting the weaknesses ofthe long routeofaccountability.Throughout the world,poor people are engaged as purchasers,co-producers,and monitors ofhealth services.For poor clients to have more control overhealth providers means:•Making the income ofhealth serviceproviders depend more on demand frompoor clients.•Increasing the purchasing power ofthepoor.•Fostering the involvement ofpoor peoplein co-producing and monitoring services.•Expanding consumer power to use com-plaint and redress mechanisms.Paying for services confers powerThe poor often ﬁrst use the commercial sec-tor to purchase key commodities forimproving health.In Colombia and Mexicocommunity cooperatives distribute insecti-cide-treated bed nets.In more than 40 coun-tries social marketing programs have reliedon market incentives.They have increasedthe use ofbed nets,condoms,contracep-tives,soap,and locally produced disinfectantfor water treatment (which has reduced therisk ofdiarrhea by 44 to 85 percent).387Modest copayments can also provide anentry ticket to clinical services for poor peo-ple by reducing capture ofsupposedly freeservices by richer groups (box 4.4).Con-trolled studies in several countries388ﬁndimprovements in the use ofservices amongpoor people after copayments increased thetransparency and accountability ofpro-viders to poor clients (ﬁgure 8.9).But to bepro-poor copayments need to be retainedlocally and tied to performance,and theyneed to contribute to the income ofpro-viders rather than compensate for inade-quate public funds (chapter 4).Health and nutrition services143Budgeting approaches often don’t link the moneyspent with the expected results.The impact ofpublic funds invested in health services and theircontribution to the Millennium DevelopmentGoals are thus difﬁcult to assess.Budgeting thecontribution of health and nutrition services togoals should address three questions:1.What are the major bottlenecks hamperingthe delivery of health services,and what is thepotential for improvement?The analysis of the determinants of the baselinecoverage of interventions in terms of availabilityof critical resources (human and material),physi-cal accessibility,demand (utilization of the ser-vices),and continuity and quality of health ser-vices helps identify the main constraints to theincrease in coverage.In Madagascar the bottlenecks of clinical careare mainly low quality,utilization,and humanresource availability.Increasing the demand forclinical services (scenario 2) especially the use ofhealth facilities or skilled health workers for thetreatment of severe respiratory infections (sce-nario 1) could raise the effective coverage of thisintervention to almost 60 percent.The potentialfor improving the availability of health staff inpoor rural areas (scenario 3) is limited,and thisdetermines a real-life “coverage frontier”(at 80percent).In Ethiopia the coverage with at leastone dose of DPT (diphtheria-pertussis-tetanusvaccine) in relation to the geographical access isthe main bottleneck,while the dropout betweenthe ﬁrst and third dose of DPT constitutesanother obstacle to adequate coverage withoutreach services.Increasing the use of  immu-nization services through information and com-munication (scenario 2) as well as defaultertracking (scenario 1) can increase the adequatecoverage to over 80 percent.In Madhya Pradeshin India,late initiation and non-exclusiveness ofbreastfeeding (BF) are the main bottlenecksidentiﬁed in self-care.Increasing the use (earlyinitiation of BF,scenario 2) and quality (exclusive-ness of BF,scenario 1) of healthy home practicesthrough information and the creation of a sup-portive environment can increase effective cov-erage to nearly 80 percent.2.How much money is needed for the expectedresults?Once coverage bottlenecks and the potential forimprovement (coverage frontiers) have beenidentiﬁed for each mode of health servicesdelivery,the cost of the strategies can be calcu-lated using country-speciﬁc data.This allows thepreparation of investment and recurrent bud-gets that speciﬁcally support strategies mostlikely to improve efﬁciency of demand (scenario1),support increased demand (scenario 2),orincrease access to health services and availabil-ity of health staff (scenario 3).This enables Min-istries of Health and Finance to determine thespending needed to support the goals and toencourage policymakers to ensure funding ofpriority activities that address the major cover-age bottlenecks.3.How much can be achieved in healthoutcomes by removing the bottlenecks?The increase in coverage in speciﬁcinterventions achievable through well-targetedstrategies and budgets such as those deﬁnedabove can be converted into measures ofimproved health outcomes using various epi-demiological models.Preliminary analysis canshow the reduction in under-ﬁve mortality ratethat can be expected from removing the bottle-necks of clinical care,outreach services,and self-care in Madagascar,Ethiopia,and MadhyaPradesh,India.Source:UNICEF and World Bank (2003).BOX 8.4Buying results to reach the Millennium Development Goals (continued)17_WDR_Ch08.qxd  8/14/03  9:49 AM  Page

Yet for many services the purchasingpower ofpoor people remains insufﬁcientto overcome price barriers (table 8.2).Mar-keting programs for condoms are unlikelyto be pro-poor in the early stages,and afocus on cost recovery excludes thepoorest.389Governments can then providesubsidies,as is often done for food toaddress malnutrition.The subsidies mayneed to be very high to substantiallyincrease use among poor people,as demon-strated in the programs to distribute freecondoms to sex workers390and to offer bednets as part ofantenatal care.391Market seg-mentation,tier pricing,and product differ-entiation can be helpful.In Malawi,highlysubsidized bed nets for pregnant womendiffer in color and shape from regular mar-ket-priced nets.392Cross-subsidizing pre-ventive and maternal and child health ser-vices using the margins on fees for adultclinical care made the ﬁrst more affordablein Bolivia.393Direct transfers to client households—demand-side subsidies—can also boostclient power.Vouchers have a good record inpromoting use ofsome well-deﬁned ser-vices.Food stamps can increase food con-sumption.394In Honduras and Nicaraguafamilies receive ﬁnancial stipends under thecondition that they use key preventive healthservices.395Financial support throughvouchers for consultations reduced sexuallytransmitted diseases for sex workers (box8.5).And poverty funds ensured third-partypayments for the poor in China.396How thesubsidies are managed matters,however.InTanzania,the poor pregnant women targetedby the bed net program almost never usedthe vouchers,probably because the subsidieswere too low.397A problem with subsidies is how wellthey reach the poor.Thailand’s low-incomeinsurance scheme has used demand-sidesubsidies—health cards—for clinical ser-vices,but about a third ofthe beneﬁciarieswere not poor and halfthe poor did notbeneﬁt.398 Demand-side subsidies also havelimits ifprovided in isolation.Even well-targeted food-related transfer programs sel-dom have measurable impacts on malnutri-tion unless accompanied by programs topromote breastfeeding,complementaryfeeding,hygiene,and care ofchildhood ill-nesses.In Mexico the success ofthe Educa-tion,Health,and Nutrition Program (Pro-gresa—see spotlight) was made possible bya parallel program ofitinerant healthteams.399Coproducing health servicesSelf-care is a particularly important type ofservice co-production,relied on by poorand rich alike,and more common in indus-trial countries than the use ofprofessionalservices.Support to families and communi-ties can help poor communities reduce mal-nutrition,as in East Asia where community-based programs were linked to servicedelivery structures,often village outlets forprimary health care.Government employ-ees were trained as facilitators ofnutrition-relevant actions coordinated and managedby volunteers selected by local communities.In Honduras the strongly community-owned AIN-C program reduced severemalnutrition by 31 percent.Civil societyorganizations can serve as intermediariesbetween clients and providers.Women’ssupport groups have helped spread the prac-tice ofexclusive breastfeeding in Africa andLatin America.Other successes includegreater use oforal rehydration solutions,better environmental health,and betterAIDS interventions.400Communities are often involved in build-ing health facilities.But they have also takenover provision and management ofprofes-sional health services,as in the more than500 community-led health clinics in Peru,which cover more than 2 million people.401Cooperative pharmacies have sprung up inHaiti,Nigeria,and Singapore.The availabil-ity ofhigh-quality drugs has been improved144WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Figure 8.9Community-managedhealth services increase utilizationand reduce spendingRandomized control study of threedistricts in Niger, 1992–94 0–2020406080Taxationwith loweruser feesTaxationwith loweruser feesUser feesPoorest 25%Average populationControl120Percent increase in number ofcurative consultations–60–40–20020User feesControlPercent change in health expendituresper episodeSource:Diop, Yazbeck, and Bitran (1995).Table 8.2Affordability remains a problem for the poorRatio (in percent) of average annualized price of health services to incomeRussiaSouth AfricaBrazilTanzaniaPoorest 11.934.620.64.4Second poorest5.320.311.62.7Middle3.313.37.22.0Second richest2.19.24.11.3Richest0.83.21.20.5Sources:Authors’ calculation based on Living Standards and Development Survey from Brazil (1996); South Africa(1993); Tanzania (1993–94); Uganda (1999); and Russia Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (1998).17_WDR_Ch08.qxd  8/14/03  9:49 AM  Page 144(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

through client-controlled revolving funds inMongolia,Vietnam,and West Africa andthrough Ethiopia’s special pharmacies.Par-ticularly resilient to crisis,these efforts canbe a source ofstability and sustainability.Inthe Democratic Republic ofCongo zones desanté continued to provide immunizationthrough community-managed services aftermore than two decades,without state ordonor support.402Client ﬁnancial and managerial controlover health staff—the power to hire andfire—can help ensure that services areactually delivered.In Mali user associationshire and pay professional health staffserv-ing more than 6 million people (spotlighton the Bamako Initiative).There,as inPeru,provider attendance is high,withstrong local ownership ofcommunity cen-ters.But the approach can have problems.The relationship between communities andhealth personnel can become antagonistic,requiring state intervention to arbitratedisputes.And the right oflocal healthboards to hire and ﬁre staffmay mean littlein countries facing severe human resourceshortages.In Zambia during the healthreform most districts hired the staffalreadyworking in the health facilities.In Mali theshortage ofnurses made recruitment difﬁ-cult,loosening the control ofclients overfrontline providers.403Solidarity mechanisms to protectsocially and economically disadvantagedgroups by pooling ﬁnancial resources canstrengthen communities in their negotia-tions with health care providers.Micro-insurance schemes for health have beenlinked to such traditional modes ofself-organization as rotating savings—as withabotasin Guinea-Bissau and traditionalcommunity schemes in the Philippines.404In Germany and the Republic ofKorea,small,not-for-proﬁt insurance societiesbecame independent purchasers ofhealthservices,contracting with public and pri-vate providers.405The proximity oftheseschemes to their insured members allowseffective monitoring.But the risk pool’ssmall size makes them very vulnerable.Re-insurance can help,406but the added com-plexity can lead to the same managerial andgovernance problems in large-scale publicprovision.The transparency ofdirect com-munity control is lost.Scaling up wouldthen be the kiss ofdeath.Information and monitoringOne ofthe strongest levers for strengthen-ing client power is information,a criticalinstrument for changing selfcare behaviors.Under government leadership in Thailand,messages on AIDS were broadcast everyhour during the peak ofthe epidemic.Butbehavior change is possible only whengrounded in an understanding ofculturalnorms and the links between behavior anddisease—and when local actors areinvolved.Community-based nutrition pro-grams have often improved nutritional sta-tus through information exchanges,as inTamil Nadu,India.In addition to givingwomen greater control over resources,themicrocredit programs ofthe BangladeshRural Action Committee also increasedknowledge.407Clients can exert more leverage onproviders by participating in decisionmak-ing and by monitoring some aspects ofser-vice delivery.Community monitoring ofhealth service performance in Bolivia andVietnam raises community awareness ofkey demand-side barriers and helps ensurethat services meet community needs.Civilsociety representatives are also part ofhealth boards in New Zealand.Theseapproaches increase the transparency ofmanagement.But these health boards alsoremain vulnerable to capture by local elitesunless institutional mechanisms ensure therepresentation ofdisadvantaged clients(chapter 5).408Health and nutrition services145A voucher program has been operating inManagua,Nicaragua,since 1995,with theobjective of increasing the use of reproduc-tive health services by female sex workers.The vouchers entitle the sex workers to freeservices at selected for-proﬁt,NGO,andpublic clinics.The clinic turns the voucher into the voucher agency,which reimbursesthe provider at an agreed-upon fee pervoucher.The incidence of sexually transmit-ted diseases among sex workers who usedthe vouchers dropped by 65 percent in theﬁrst three years of the program.Vouchersare now available to the clients of sex work-ers and their partners.Source:Gorter and others (1999).BOX 8.5Vouchers for sex workers in Nicaragua17_WDR_Ch08.qxd  8/14/03  9:50 AM  Page 145(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Enforcement and regulationLegal and other dispute mechanisms—ombudsman services,the judicial system,andpressures on professional associations—canenforce provider accountability.But there islittle proofthat such mechanisms work infavor ofthe poor.A study in the United Statesin 2000 found that 97 percent ofpeople withnegligent injury did not sue.Better-offclientswent to court,while poor clients did not.InIndia women from lower castes were lesslikely to use consumers’courts.Seventy-sixpercent ofIndian doctors believed the Con-sumer Protection Act to be only moderatelyeffective because ofweak enforcement andresistance from professionals.Sanctions areoften a weak threat,because health providerstend to protect one another,and accountabil-ity channels do not favor poor clients.Ram-pant corruption in the legal system ofmanycountries also works against poor people.409Strengthening poor citizens’voiceSimply don’t vote for your mayor ...ifhe doesn’tprovide you access to your health program.Managers ofthe Health Agent Program that reduced infant mortality in Ceará,Brazil Since ancient times,city councils have beeninvolved in curtailing the spread ofplague,cholera,and leprosy.But the state as the mainactor in health emerged only in the 20th cen-tury,starting in centrally planned systems—the Soviet Union and others—and thenspreading to Western Europe after World WarII,with the government as unchallengedleader ofthe formal health system.Manydeveloping countries have followed,withhealth services being part ofthe social con-tract between the (often) newly independentstates and their citizens.The model was notalways successful—witness the remaininghealth gaps between poor and rich in middle-and low-income countries.But some coun-tries—Brazil,Malaysia,Sri Lanka,and CostaRica (chapter 1)—have done better than oth-ers in making the long route ofaccountabilitywork for poor people by:•Channeling collective resources to poorpeople through multiple allocationmechanisms that combine targeting dis-eases ofthe poor,poor regions,servicedelivery providers close to poor people,and vulnerable groups and individuals.•Developing coalitions that bring poorpeople into the policymaking processthrough both elections and advocacy bycivil society.•Establishing accountability for progresson outcomes,particularly among poorpeople through increased informationand citizen monitoring ofhealth services.Which services and for whom?How do we know ifvoice works for poorpeople? There is no conclusive evidence thateither one ofthe main resource-generationmechanisms for health services emanatingfrom collective action—social insurance(Bismark model) or general taxation (Bev-eridge model)—works better for thepoor.410To be pro-poor they both requiresome level ofcross-subsidy—througheither differential premiums or progressivetaxes.More than prepayment,third-partypayment—whether through insurance orother solidarity funds—is what makes thedifference for poor people (box 8.6).There is also no clear answer on whetherproviding universal access to a limited set of146WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Copayments are not always regressive (seechapter 4),and prepayment and insuranceare not inherently pro-poor.In Tanzania’sCommunity Financing Funds,poorergroups’copayments subsidized care forwealthier insured groups.The poor enroll involuntary health schemes in small numbers,as in Cameroon,Ghana,and Rwanda—andin smaller proportions than richer groups,asin the Democratic Republic of Congo,Guinea,and Senegal.Employment-basedsocial insurance systems have beenobserved to beneﬁt richer groups most inLatin America and Africa.A review of Asiancommunity ﬁnancing schemes concludedthat equity was low.Matching grants forinsurance premiums are often captured bythe local elites,as in Thailand during theearly days of the health card.The grantssometimes simply lead richer groups tosubstitute private care for public services.One way for governments to provideincome protection to the poor is throughprogressive taxation or payroll-based socialinsurance,with egalitarian beneﬁts.But thisis often difﬁcult to implement in developingand transition countries with weak taxationcapacity (in China the proportion of grossdomestic product collected by the state fellfrom 30 percent in 1980 to 10 percent in1999).Taxes in low-income countries arealso often regressive.An alternative is for governments tosubsidize insurance for the poor,usingincome-related sliding scales for premiumsand copayments.Income-related contribu-tions were successful in promoting equity inIsrael and in the Gomoshasthaya Kendracommunity ﬁnancing scheme inBangladesh.Governments can also developspeciﬁc schemes for the poor,as wassuccessfully done in Indonesia andThailand.Both approaches require somemeans testing and the adequate and timelycompensation of providers.And leakagesare to be expected.Source:Preker and others (2001).BOX 8.6Making health insurance work for poor people17_WDR_Ch08.qxd  8/14/03  9:50 AM  Page 146(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

services or targeting poor people is the way togo.The debate is often not in these terms.MostOrganisation for Economic Co-operation andDevelopment (OECD) countries use bothapproaches.Many middle-income countriesare moving gradually,developing multiple pro-grams to protect children,women,and thepoor,as in Colombia,Indonesia,Iran,andTurkey.These programs may eventuallymerge into a national system ofuniversal cov-erage,as happened in industrial countries andrecently in Thailand.Geographical,age,andindividual targeting—despite leakages—oftenreach the poor.But a combination ofmecha-nisms seems necessary,and each country hasto assess whether mechanisms in place aresuccessful (table 8.3).Decentralization has often been imple-mented with the hope that it would betteralign spending with local needs,reducing theinformation asymmetry between citizens andpoliticians.But decentralization has hadmixed results in health.411It has not alwaysmeant increased resources for poor areas.Transferring the provision function to localgovernments has often overwhelmed them,leaving them with little capacity and incen-tives to develop the policy function andencourage citizen oversight.The transfer ofownership ofassets—hospitals and clinics—to local government has also created incen-tives for rent-seeking by local elites.InUganda allocations to health servicesdeclined when districts received responsibil-ity for service delivery,personnel manage-ment,and allocation ofhealth resources.Spending on primary health care fell from 33percent to 16 percent during 1995–98,andthe use ofmaternal and child health servicesdeclined signiﬁcantly412(chapter 10).Health and nutrition services147Table 8.3How do we know whether poor people’s voices have been heard?Key questionsEvidenceProblemsIs there a constitutional or legislative commitment • Most countries have constitutions that express • Lack of prioritization or targeting gives the non-poor to guarantee some level of health service to all?some commitment to universal access or rights to incentives to seek more services or shift from health care.

Pro-poor coalitions With widespread capture ofhealth servicesby the non-poor,building pro-poor coali-tions to inﬂuence health spending is critical.The democratic process conveys what poorcitizens value in health and health care.Theextent ofhealth beneﬁts and the ﬁnancing ofhealth services are an electoral issue inindustrial countries—and,increasingly,everywhere.In Thailand access to health ser-vices was a key plank in the political platformofthe Thai Rak Thai party,and its proposalfor universal health insurance,with a single30-baht copayment,was eventually imple-mented.413Eliminating hunger was a majortheme in the recent elections in Brazil.Beyond the ballot box,poor citizens cancommunicate their preferences throughnational consultations,such as those forpoverty reduction strategy papers (chapter11).A review ofthe consultation process for25 poverty reduction strategy papers showsthat the poor care about health services,espe-cially access,price,and social distance.In thestate ofOregon in the United States,tradeoffsin beneﬁt coverage are discussed in consulta-tions with the public.In the Netherlands theDunning Report,proposing criteria forrationing health services,relied heavily oncitizen consultations.Citizen involvement inbudgeting is now an avenue for more voice inhealth service delivery,as in Porto Alegre,Brazil (chapter 5).414Advocacy by civil society organizationscan put the interests ofgroups forgotten ordiscriminated against on the agenda,as in thecampaign and court action to ban the use ofquinacrine for chemical sterilization in India.Such organizations can build coalitions forthe interests ofthe disadvantaged.Pressurethrough self-help groups and NGOs has trig-gered a productive dialogue on the publicresponse to AIDS in the Philippines andSouth Africa.Yet despite years ofendorsement ofpar-ticipation,most health systems still resistgreater involvement by civil society in inﬂu-encing health care allocations.Reforms inthe health sector often engender oppositionby powerful unions and professional associa-tions,which have a much stronger powerbase than poor citizens and can ﬁght tomaintain the status quo,as in New Zealand.An altruistic vision can nonetheless motivatecoalitions between providers and citizens forbetter services.Associations ofrural doctorsin Thailand and midwives in Guatemalahave promoted alternative modes ofhealthservice delivery that better reach the poor.Information and monitoring toincrease accountability for outcomesCreating policymaker accountability to citi-zens for delivering health services is a difﬁculttask.A patient dying while waiting in line at apublic hospital makes front-page news.Butthe thousands ofchildren who die oftreat-able or vaccine-preventable diseases do notget equal time.Politicians ﬁnd it easier toclaim success for building a hospital and pro-viding employment to nurses and doctorsthan for reducing malnutrition among anomadic group.Yet with a web ofmarket andgovernment failures affecting those services,policymakers are uniquely placed to create avision conducive to better outcomes.Theyneed to be accountable for equitably distrib-uted health outcomes,protecting citizensagainst impoverishing health expendituresand helping the poor escape their socialexclusion,and not for the provision ofgrow-ing quantities ofservices.Better informed and educated citizens canmake politicians more accountable.Civilsociety organizations can bridge the asym-metry ofinformation between poor citizensand policymakers.They can bring commu-nity participation into research,to ensurethat the perspectives ofpoor people inﬂuencepolicy.Monitoring the performance ofgov-ernment policies,with report cards as in Ban-galore and Ukraine (chapter 5),can workwell,particularly when income-disaggregateddata are available.Civil society can also serve as a watchdog.A Belgian health publication set in motion sixroyal decrees ofprotective legislation bydrawing attention to health hazards.InBolivia a census-based,impact-orientedapproach combines pragmatism with quanti-tative and qualitative approaches.415But gen-erating information to support pro-poorcoalitions is a challenge.Epidemiological sur-veys may neglect the needs ofperipheralsocial groups,such as minority groups orthose affected by less common diseases.148WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 200417_WDR_Ch08.qxd  8/14/03  9:51 AM  Page 148(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Compacts:provider incentivesto serve the poorAs long as men are liable to die and are desirous tolive,a physician will be well paid.Jean de La Bruyère,1645–1696Even when policymakers truly care abouthealth services for poor people,it is not easyto translate policy into reality.Making thecompact between policymakers and providerswork for the poor implies that governments:•Benchmark performance for servicesthey can monitor easily;•Foster autonomous providers for clinicalservices;•Establish a strong monitoring function.Buying resultsWidespread deﬁciencies in the technicalquality and ethics offrontline providers serv-ing the poor—whether public or private—reveal an incentive problem.416The solutionlies in some form ofcompact between thepolicymaker and provider to align theprovider’s incentives—already acknowledgedby La Bruyère in the 17th century—with thepolicymaker’s wishes.How countries can cre-ate incentives to make autonomous or dis-persed health service providers accountablefor outputs and outcomes depends on thenature ofservices and the capacity to createaccountability for public objectives throughpurchasing and regulation.417Outcome-based contracts are difﬁcult toimplement because health outcomes areoften slow to change,difﬁcult and expensiveto measure,and affected by multiple factorsother than health services.Such contracts areespecially difﬁcult to write when outcomesare linked to a variety ofservices,both profes-sional and nonprofessional,as in efforts toreduce under-ﬁve mortality or HIV preva-lence.But the experience ofMadagascar andSenegal with nutrition programs for the poorshows that it is possible,at least for malnutri-tion (box 8.7).Less difﬁcult to implement are output-based contracts that specify criteria fordisbursing public subsidies—on the basis ofincreasing immunization rates,for example.Output-based contracting is particularly suc-cessful for easily monitorable,single-product,population-oriented services that can bestandardized.Explicit contracts have proveneffective in serving poor,hard-to-reachgroups.418Output-based fees for services canbe paid to providers when quantity and qual-ity can be deﬁned,thus contributing toimprovements in productivity.In BangladeshNGO ﬁeld health workers were paid on thebasis oftheir clients’knowledge oforal rehy-dration therapy.Implicit contracts with focus on speciﬁcoutputs can also work,as demonstrated bythe universal childhood immunization cam-paigns ofthe 1980s,and the Vitamin A sup-plementation and itinerant health teams inEgypt,Indonesia,and Mexico.419Malawi andUzbekistan have achieved immunizationcoverage ofmore than 90 percent among thepoor with very low per capita spending.ButBolivia,Guatemala,and Turkey,with higherlevels ofspending,are much less successfulin providing equitable coverage (ﬁgure 8.10).Performance-based contracts,whetherdirectly with health providers or with pur-chasers or insurers,need to align money withintent,taking into account the variations ineffort required to produce a given output inpoor and disadvantaged regions and inbetter-offcommunities.420Costs ofservicescan be much higher in remote rural areas,and broad variations have been found in thecost ofimmunization between regions in thesame country.421Health and nutrition services149Community nutrition projects in Madagas-car and Senegal contracted out nutritionalservices.Transaction costs for introducingand maintaining the contracts were 13 per-cent of total project costs in Madagascarand 17 percent in Senegal.Both projectswere well targeted to the poor communities.Activities included growth monitoring,health and nutrition education services formothers,food supplementation for mal-nourished children,and referrals to healthcenters and home visits when necessary.In Madagascar the project also had asocial fund for income-generating activi-ties,and in Senegal an effort to improveaccess to water.The frontline providers in Madagascarincluded women from the targeted neigh-borhoods selected by the communities andsupervised by physicians hired by the pro-jects.Open tendering was used to select thesupervising NGOs in Madagascar.Contrac-tual agreements speciﬁed the services to beprovided and the number of beneﬁciariesto be served,monitored monthly by theuser community and the project.Childhood malnutrition declined signiﬁ-cantly in both projects.An evaluation inSenegal after 17 months of project imple-mentation showed almost zero prevalenceof severe malnutrition among children aged6–11 months and a reduction in moderatemalnutrition from 28 percent to 24 percentamong children aged 6–35 months.Source:Marek and others (1999).BOX 8.7The government as active purchaser ofhealthoutcomes through strategic contracting 17_WDR_Ch08.qxd  8/14/03  9:52 AM  Page 149(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Performance benchmarks for more dis-cretionary or multitask services,such asclinical care,are more difﬁcult to establish.Which services for whom,when,where,how,and how much are difﬁcult to specifyin advance.Effort and quality are not read-ily veriﬁable.Providers have more gamingspace.422Targeted payments to increase cer-vical smears in the United Kingdom led to ashort-term increase in the number ofsmears.But in the long term providers reor-ganized their activities so that they wouldcontinue to receive the payments withoutdelivering the services.423Clinical service contracts also take con-siderable capacity to write and enforce.424Purchasing based on output—per visit,percase,per hospital day—causes the quantityofclinical services provided to rise (some-times mainly among better-offgroups) andthe costs to escalate.Health reforms oftentry to contain costs by establishing ﬁxed-price contracts—capitated payments,orprospective global budgets—using caps tokeep costs down and shifting risks to theprovider.But this leaves to frontlineproviders the responsibility for rationingservices,opening the possibility for cream-skimming.Providers can lower their stan-dard ofcare,deny service,or insist on addi-tional informal fees (box 8.8).Equitable service distribution thenrequires providers to have both the techni-cal capacity to inform the rationing processand a pro-poor ethos to make this processbeneﬁt the poor—a combination often dif-ﬁcult to achieve.High- and middle-incomecountries are therefore increasingly delegat-ing the undertaking ofclinical service con-tracts to an autonomous—often paras-tatal—social insurance organization thatnegotiates agreements for services to beprovided.They rely on more sophisticatedcontracts and monitoring systems usingcomplex payment methods:for example,case-based payments in Georgia or diag-nostically related groups in Hungary.Identifying poor target groups andmonitoring results are also more difﬁcultfor clinical care,because needs are moredifﬁcult to deﬁne.Cambodia’s contract,which included speciﬁc provisions toincrease clinical services for the poor,hadmixed results (spotlight on Cambodia).Incentives for treating those most in needcan be strengthened by calibrating pay-ments to providers on the basis ofimpacton health outcomes,with higher paymentsfor emergency obstetric care,as in BurkinaFaso,or with higher payments for treatingthe poor,as in the Kyrgyz Republic (box8.9).To exempt the poor from fees,how-150WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004ˆRatio of poor to rich for DPT3 immunizationTanzaniaZimbabweZambiaUgandaTogoNigeriaNigerNamibiaMozambiqueMauritaniaMaliMalawiMadagascarKenyaGuineaGhanaEthiopiaCôte d’IvoireChadCentralAfricanRepublicCameroonBurkina FasoBeninPakistanIndiaBangladeshTurkeyMoroccoEgyptPeruParaguayNicaraguaHaitiGuatemalaDominican RepublicColombiaBrazilBoliviaUzbekistanKyrgyz RepublicKazakhstanVietnamPhilippinesIndonesiaCambodia00.40.81.21101001000Per capita public expenditure on health (US$)—log scaleFigure 8.10High spending does not ensure more equitable immunizationIn 1999 in Poland,Mrs.K.contributed a healthpremium amounting to 7.5 percent of her salary,but was not able to see a public-privateinsurance doctor “free of charge”even once.Sev-eral times she tried to get an appointment withthe doctor in the outpatient clinic where shesigned in.But she was told every time that “thereare no tickets”for that day.In the end she wentto the private internal medicine doctor and paidout of pocket.425Source:World Bank (2001d).BOX 8.8The risks ofcapitation paymentsSource: Authors’ calculations using Demographic and Health Survey data and World Bank data.17_WDR_Ch08.qxd  8/14/03  9:52 AM  Page 150(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

ever,providers need to receive timely andadequate compensation.Contractual arrangements often need tocombine soft capacity-building componentsto meet unserved needs with rewards forperformance.Experience with perfor-mance-based contracts for immunization aspart ofthe Global Alliance for Vaccines andImmunizations shows that zero-based con-tracts and the threat ofresource withdrawalwere not very effective in raising coverage.426Variations across communities can be takeninto account through a two-tier allocationsystem.The ﬁrst tier can be allocated to alocal government on a capitation basis—asin Argentina,Brazil,Ethiopia,and Poland—and the second tier to an insurance fund or apurchasing agency in charge ofmaximizingthe efﬁciency ofresources and purchasingan appropriate mix and quantity ofclinicalservices—as in Korea and New Zealand (ﬁg-ure 8.11).The impact on the poor ofthe changes inprovider payments from input-based tomore complex output-based is not conclu-sive,and there has been little evaluation.Butthe separation ofpolicymaking from pur-chasing and service provision creates clearerchannels ofaccountability.Autonomousproviders have more ﬂexibility in ensuringthe appropriate input mix including hiringand ﬁring,as in Kenya and Zambia.427Pur-chasing bodies are more independent actors,subject to a double line ofaccountabilitybecause they are often ﬁnanced by govern-ments and households through insurancesystems.Governments need to be involvedin these agencies to deﬁne which services thepoor need most,price the subsidy supportneeded by the poor,and limit providers’conﬂicts ofinterest.Selecting providersThere is no presumption that one type ofprovider—public,for-proﬁt,or not-for-proﬁt—is likely to be better than any other.Public health facilities can be remarkablyefﬁcient,as in Malaysia,or largely ineffec-tive,as in middle-income Gabon,whereimmunization levels have stalled at under30 percent.Nor are NGOs necessarily pro-poor.When contracted by governments,NGOs also tend to get closer to the publicsector.An autonomous parastatal hospitalin France that enjoys large ﬁnancial andmanagement ﬂexibility and an NGO hospi-tal under government contract in Canadaare not very different.For population-oriented services that canbe standardized,governments can generallywrite contracts for public or private pro-viders.Policymakers can specify the serviceHealth and nutrition services151Figure 8.11Citizens exert power on both providers and purchasers PolicymakerBuyingoutcomesBuyingoutputsCitizensVoiceSocialinclusionHealthoutcomes(MDGs)IncomeprotectionService providerPurchaser/Social insuranceVoiceCompactCompactClientpowerSupporttoself-careOutreachClinicalservices••The Kyrgyz Republic created an insurance fundto purchase services from health facilities,com-pensating them for increased use of services andproviding greater ﬁnancial access to the poor.Facilities charge fees to patients and claim pay-ments from the insurance funds under a slidingscale based on ﬁve categories of patients:self-referred,uninsured,insured,partly exempt,andfully exempt.Facilities get higher compensationfor clients from the partly exempt and exemptcategories,who pay lower fees.Sixty-eight per-cent of poor patients preferred the copaymentsystem over the previous theoretically free sys-tem,which often required “informal”payments.Under the new payment mechanism,manyinformal payments were replaced by formalcopayments.The very poor have access to treat-ment through a reserve fund.Source:Kutzin (2003).BOX 8.9Modulatedpayments forproviders accordingto income criteria 17_WDR_Ch08.qxd  8/14/03  9:53 AM  Page 151(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

characteristics and monitor and enforce thecontract.Government providers deliverhigh immunization rates in Tajikistan orTunisia—but in Cambodia and Haiti so docontracted NGOs.As contractors NGOscan extend service outreach and test newapproaches to service delivery.428To support self-care,private services—whether for-proﬁt or not-for-proﬁt—oftenare most appropriate.Private for-proﬁtproviders can be very efﬁcient in providinginformation and distributing commodi-ties—witness the success ofsocial market-ing.For information and social support,grassroots organizations,small privateproviders,and community-based organiza-tions often do the job better than rigid pub-lic organizations.Governments can con-tract some key services such as information.Yet public services can sometimes be morepro-poor than NGO services.In Ceará,Brazil,“many NGOs delivered services inclinics while the public service sent itsworkers into households”429(see spotlight).For clinical services the contrast is sharper.Public provision works well when there is astrong public ethos,the politics are pro-poor,and rules are enforced.For-proﬁt pro-viders—qualiﬁed or not—are usually in tunewith demand,but the inherent conﬂicts ofinterest require external control.In Lebanonand elsewhere,expansion ofthe private sec-tor did not beneﬁt the poor much.430InIndia,private providers serving poor groupsare often less than qualiﬁed.Governmentscan then exert control only ifthey havesophisticated regulation and purchasingfunctions.When these do not exist,partner-ships between government and civil societyorganizations can compensate by strengthen-ing clients’power over clinical providers.Because not-for-proﬁt organizationsoften beneﬁt from strong intrinsic motiva-tion and professional ethos,governmentcan also write open-ended contracts withthem and still expect that providers will dothe right thing.Service delivery by NGOscan help repair the link between policymak-ers and providers for clinical services withsigniﬁcant beneﬁts for the poor.InGuatemala,about a third ofthe populationis now served by NGO providers,signiﬁ-cantly increasing access for indigenous poorpopulations although management andquality problems have been observed.431Regulation and enforcementGovernments can also use market regulationto counter conﬂicts ofinterest.In Hungaryaccreditation mechanisms have been quitesuccessful in establishing quality criteria forproviders.To reduce supplier-induced over-supply and compensate for the lack ofinvest-ment in poorer settings,most countries usecertiﬁcates ofneeds (in United States),plan-ning boards (Australia),or health maps(Spain and most ofAfrica).But most low-income countries do not regulate their phar-maceutical market successfully,thoughCambodia has had some success.When reg-ulation fails,a combination ofuser educa-tion and provider training can yield thegreatest beneﬁts.432Government involve-ment through national tendering,price cap-ping,or tariffreduction has also inﬂuencedthe prices ofpharmaceuticals.433Overall theenforcement ofregulatory controls is oftenweak,focusing mainly on personnel licens-ing.The same political and institutional fail-ures hampering health service delivery affectthe legislative,administrative,and judicialservices needed to make regulation work.Expanding access to professional healthcare providers—particularly midwifery,sur-gical skills for reducing maternal mortality,and clinical skills for reducing neonataldeaths—is a priority to reach the MillenniumDevelopment Goals.In many countries theimbalance between rural and urban areas interms ofskilled health workers is extreme.InTurkey,there is one doctor per 266 people inthe richest region and one per 2,609 in thepoorest.In Ghana and Senegal more thanhalfthe physicians are concentrated in thecapital city,where fewer than 20 percent ofpeople live.Health workers lack opportuni-ties in rural areas where turnover is high.Rural workers are less likely to be female andeducated.Lack ofservices (school,water) andaccess to training/education are major incen-tives to leave rural areas.Undifferentiatedsalary structures are disincentives to work inareas where the poor live,because it is difﬁ-cult to supplement low salaries with alterna-tive income from activities such as privatepractice,teaching,and consulting.434152WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 200417_WDR_Ch08.qxd  8/14/03  9:53 AM  Page 152(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Chile,Mexico,and Thailand435have usedﬁnancial and nonﬁnancial incentives toencourage qualiﬁed staffto work in ruralareas.In Indonesia doctors were also allowedto supply private services during or after dutyhours.Other countries have tried to establishnew credentials,as for health ofﬁcers inEthiopia,and trained community workers inIndia and Brazil (spotlight on Ceará).Another approach includes progressivelyupgrading the skills oftraditional providers,such as community midwives in Malaysia,orencouraging the hiring and training ofhealthworkers from underserved areas or socialgroups as done in Indonesia and Iran.In theBangladesh Rural Advancement Committee(BRAC) community workers are trained toseek out the extremely poor in need ofurgentmedical care.But success requires carefuldesign and evaluation.In El Salvador low-skilled health promoters posted in rural vil-lages did little to improve health or health-seeking behavior.436The global crisis in thelabor market for clinical services also requiresinnovative strategies to get professional ser-vices to rural areas and the poor (box 8.10).Health and nutrition services153When the international community set out in1955 to eradicate malaria,Africa was left outbecause it lacked adequately trained person-nel.Today,Africa still lacks such personnel,andyet it must deal with multiple disease-controlefforts.In Burkina Faso,the average number ofphysicians per 100,000 people was 3.4 in the1990s compared with 303 for nine industrialcountries.In Zambia the already low number ofphysicians,at 8.3 per 100,000 people in the1960s,declined to 6.9 in the 1990s.To meet therequirements of the priority health interven-tions recommended by the World Health Orga-nization,Chad would require a sevenfoldincrease in health personnel.High rates of absenteeism reﬂect disenchant-ment with working conditions.Studies of healthprofessionals in Ghana,India,Mozambique,Tanza-nia,and Uganda show that the health workforce—nurses and physicians in particular—feeloverworked and underappreciated.In Guinea,Mauritania,Poland,and Russia health staff wageshave declined in real terms.There has been considerable emigration ofhealth professionals from developing countries.More than 600 South African doctors are regis-tered in New Zealand,at a cost to South Africantaxpayers of roughly $37 million.An estimated61 percent of Ghanaian doctors trained between1985 and 1994 left the country.Nurses are leav-ing too:in 2001 the United Kingdom approved22,462 work permits for nurses from developingcountries.To retain internationally marketable healthstaff,poor countries will have to offerinternationally competitive wages and beneﬁts.That requires replacing inﬂexible civil servicepolicies with more ﬂexible approaches.Trainingspeciﬁcally oriented to national markets can alsohelp.Countries that emulate the training stan-dards of industrial countries tend to be more vul-nerable to poaching (Ghana).There is evidencefrom Ethiopia and the Gambia that communitynurses and health ofﬁcers with curricula notinternationally certiﬁed are less likely to migrate.BOX 8.10The human resource crisis in health services Human resources constraints for clinical care010100ChadCôte d’IvoireComorosLesothoHondurasMyanmarZambiaGuatemalaSudanCape VerdeThe PhilippinesIraqIranTurkeyPeruBoliviaEgyptNicaraguaTajikistanSouth AfricaAzerbaijanChinaParaguayZimbabweMadagascarSenegalTogoCameroonNigerMaliEritreaMedical personnel (doctors and nurses) per 100,000 population (log scale)Percent assisted deliveries1,00010,00040080HaitiGambiaBurkina FasoBeninBangladeshBhutanYemenPakistanLaoMoroccoCambodiaTanzaniaEquatorialGuineaConstrainedcountriesKenyaIndiaNigerSierra LeoneP.

154WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004In the words of a professor of midwifery,“Midwives should be able to take on a moreenabled,‘for women’role.This then has implica-tions for regulation,which should be ‘self regu-lated’to a point—but should also have input tothat process from women themselves,and fromfellow professionals....Midwives should be veryinvolved in the process,...but if they are the onlyones involved,the danger is that a ‘for midwife’culture develops,protecting midwives and per-petuating problems....The formal process canalso be backed up by a less formal process (i.e.peer review) to ensure lots of midwife to midwifecontact and learning.This ‘with-women/for-women’stance can then form a foundation forwhat ‘professionalism’looks like for midwifery....We need to be able to form a contract,...and fol-low up on it,all the time respecting woman’sindividuality and the culture in which she lives.This all implies enough education to do this well,and enough power to inﬂuence the system.Thisis what I would describe as ‘professional’.”Sources:ICM (2003) and Davies (2001).BOX 8.11Developing a professional ethos in midwiferyThe complexity and dispersed nature ofclinical health services and the potential forconﬂicts ofinterest make self-monitoring byproviders critical for effective service deliv-ery.Historically,peer regulation has been thecommon response to a conﬂict ofinterest.But because ofstate dominance in manycountries,professional bodies are fairlyweak.Provider-driven changes in the organi-zation ofservice provision can yield substan-tial beneﬁts for clients,as in initiatives suchas Health Workers for Change.437The Ger-man health system is largely self-regulated.Professional associations in Zimbabwemaintain professional ethics and standardsamong public and private nurses.438Associa-tions ofmidwives in Guatemala and NewZealand develop and promote a pro-poorethos (box 8.11).Information and monitoringDecentralization,devolution,and output-based contracting ofservices increase theimportance oftimely and accurate informa-tion for monitoring performance.Nationaland international statistics do not yet capturethe range ofpractices or the performance ofall health care providers.Most ministries ofhealth know little about the private sector,which makes it hard to develop partnershipsor contracts,although countries are attempt-ing to conduct provider surveys as inPoland.439Information on access,quality,andefﬁciency is scarce and often noncomparable.And because many factors outside the healthsector affect health status,cross-sectoralmonitoring and planning are also required,asThailand’s National Economic and SocialDevelopment Board does regularly.Monitoring ofaverage outcomes or ser-vice utilization patterns often does not revealwhere change is occurring.Changes in fertil-ity rates and contraceptive use in most Sub-Saharan countries in the 1990s have beenconcentrated in the urban,richest popula-tion segments.In Tanzania the declining useofskilled delivery care between 1993 and1999 can be attributed mainly to declininguse among the poorest groups.When col-lecting information on income is difﬁcult,alternative indicators can be used,such asethnicity,caste,region,gender,linguisticgroup,or religion.Countries as different asColombia,Indonesia,Iran,Mexico,and thePhilippines use community maps to identifyhigh-risk individuals and households inneed ofhome visits and special attention.440Six sizes ﬁt all?

Output-based contracting is possible. Decentralization can pose problems as economies of scale can be important because of network externality and public goods.Public financing: as collective action needed, funds to come from the public purse, most often taxes. Financing can be integrated into social insurance—if the latter is well functioning and pro-poor—with public subsidy. Demand-side subsidies to stimulate demand.Voice: pro-poor coalitions putting pressure on governments with limited capacity to focus action on services they can monitor, reaching the whole population.

Outcome (nutrition) and output (knowledge, goods)–based contracting of local NGOs or community-based organizations if capacity to monitor results exists.Public subsidies: “supply side” to commodities and information, e.g., social marketing; “demand-side” (vouchers) to individuals and communities. Client power: imitate the market and foster role of civil society organizations in disseminating information and commodities: commercial networks, cooperative, peer/support groups, community based organizations, local NGOS.Copayments: competition likely to drive prices down as asymmetry of information is low.

Public provision implies standardization of the benefits package and a well-accepted rationing approach combined with a strong public ethos.

Public subsidies to insurance premiums, exemptions for copayments for the poor, and/or third-party payments (e.g., poverty funds). Equalization of resource allocation for poor regions: matching grants, poverty-sensitive capitation.Client’s power, voice and providers’ ethos.

demand-side subsidies to poor families forthose and for appropriate self-care (3).Needs for clinical care can be made homo-geneous through a technocratic rationing ofservices based on equal beneﬁts.In this casean integrated service delivery approach—ora universal single payer system—can beappropriate,as in Cuba,Finland,and Viet-nam (5).But these conditions are far from univer-sal.Needs for self-care or clinical servicesare rarely homogeneous.This heterogeneitycan be accommodated in a pro-poor con-text through decentralization and ﬂexibleoutput-based and outcome-based contract-ing combined with equalization ofsubsi-dies between rich and poor regions (3 and5).Subsidies for clinical services can be pro-vided to local medical schemes (as in Ger-many and Poland),to speciﬁc schemes forpoor people (as in France,Indonesia,andThailand),or directly to poor groups(poverty funds in China) (5).The long route ofaccountability may alsonot be working—either because richer groupscapture the political process or because thebureaucratic process—compact—does notdeliver.In these cases more investment in thelong route through taxation and strengthenedgovernment actions is unlikely to do much forthe poor.Instead,more needs to be invested inmaking poor citizens’voice heard by fosteringcivil society groups,and building pro-poorcoalitions for services requiring collectiveaction.Governments with limited capacitycan then be pressured to focus on contractingpopulation-oriented services,in partnershipwith intrinsically motivated providers—com-munity or civil society organizations—tomake sure the services are delivered (2).Serving heterogeneous needs where thelong route ofaccountability is not workingis common in developing countries andrequires enlisting poor people as monitors,investing in client’s power.Commercial andmedia networks,cooperatives,and commu-nity-driven development activities are thenbest used to support self-care (4).Micro-insurance schemes,and community co-managed health services and drug funds areespecially relevant for clinical care (6).Butthis power is not enough to avoid conﬂictsofinterest.Litigation can be oflimited help.More importantly,altruistically motivatedproviders,such as not-for-proﬁts,can helpfoster a stronger pro-poor ethos supportedby professional selfregulation (6).None ofthe solutions is fast or easy.Butsuccess is clearly possible,as hundreds ofexamples have shown.“It does not matterhow slowly you go so long as you do notstop”(Confucius,551–479 BC).156WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 200417_WDR_Ch08.qxd  8/14/03  9:55 AM  Page 156(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

mortality.After recessions in the 1980s,growth has resumed and progress on healthstatus continues.One way to attain goodhealth from initially low income is surely tostop having a low income.The Cuban puzzle—good health without growthThe puzzle is Cuba.How has Cuba man-aged to maintain an infant mortality rate atleast as low as that ofany developing coun-try in the Western Hemisphere and quite afew industrial counties as well? The sus-tained focus ofthe political leadership onhealth for more than 40 years surely playeda big part.After the revolution,universaland equitable health care was one ofthegovernment’s top three goals.The govern-ment sees good health as a key performanceindicator for itself.Despite low infant mortality before therevolution,rural areas lagged far behindurban areas.The new government,com-mitted to changing this,concentrated onproviding health care to rural areas.Itrequired all new medical school graduatesto serve for one year in rural areas.It alsoincreased the number ofrural health facili-ties.In 1961 the government nationalizedmutual-aid cooperatives and private hospi-tals,which left the public sector as the soleprovider ofhealth services—a feature ofthesystem that remains today.At that timemany ofthe country’s medical profession-als left the country (as many as two-thirdsby one estimate).In the mid- to late 1960s there were twomajor innovations in the health system.First was the establishment ofpoliclinics—the basic unit ofhealth services—eachstaffed by several specialists and nurses andserving a population of25,000–30,000.This was combined with campaigns toimmunize many more people,control vec-tors (such as mosquitoes),and promotegood health practices.Costa Rica and Cuba both have verysimilar,low infant mortalityrates—almost as low as Canada’sthough at much lower incomes (ﬁgure1).442Their routes to this happy circum-stance,however,have been quite differentIn 1945,infant mortality—measured indeaths ofinfants under one year per 1,000live births—was 100 in Costa Rica and 40 inCuba,respectively.Up to 1960 Costa Ricamade progress largely due to economicgrowth and aggressive public health pro-grams.443Hookworm was eliminated with aprogram starting in 1942,and public healthcampaigns accelerated after the revolution of1948.As a result,malaria,tuberculosis,andmost diseases that were preventable by vac-cines at that time were also eliminated by1960.In stark contrast,Cuba’s admittedlylow level ofinfant mortality stagnated undera particularly corrupt political regime.Since 1960,progress in Costa Rica hasbeen rapid but not too difﬁcult to explain.Costa Rica’s real income per capitaincreased by 25 percent from 1960 to1970—the same rate,coincidentally,thatinfant mortality declined.Income growthof40 percent by 1980 along with the uni-versalization ofcoverage for health care sawa further decrease of60 percent in infantSecond was the creation ofa commu-nity health program,with specialists tend-ing patients in clinics as well as at home,school,or work.In the mid-1980s this community-basedapproach was intensiﬁed with the FamilyDoctor Program.The goal:to place a doctortrained in primary health care and a nursein every neighborhood (serving about 150families).By 2001 there were more than30,000 doctors—a ratio ofone family doc-tor for every 365 Cubans.444Services arefree,although nonhospitalized patients arerequired to co-pay for medicines.While this approach clearly contributesto better health outcomes,it is also expen-sive.Indeed,Cuba spends substantially moreofits gross domestic product on health thanother Latin American countries:6.6 percentin 2002.(Average public spending on healthis 3.3 percent in Latin America and theCaribbean,but some other countries alsospend substantial amounts—Costa Rica 4.4percent and Panama 5.2 percent).445Specifying what you want—andkeeping track of what’s going onThe Cuban health model rests on three pil-lars:giving clear instructions to providers,motivating staff,and monitoring and eval-uating the system.446Clear guidelines areprovided through national specialist advi-sory groups—which draw up standards andtechnical procedures (and evaluate the per-formance ofphysicians and specialists)—and regulations that standardize activitiesin the national hospital care system.Health staffin Cuba typically are highlymotivated.Medical training emphasizes thealtruism ofmedical service—often culmi-nating in service ofone or two yearsabroad.This is volunteer service,but thereare strong social pressures for it.Serving inpoor rural areas in Cuba remains a right ofpassage for many newly trained doctors.Television programs lauding health workersGood health at (initially) low incomeCosta Rica and Cuba have both attained very low levels ofinfant mortality in the last 50 years.For Costa Rica,this is eas-ily explained by rapid income growth and attention to traditional public health and,in recent years,to innovativeapproaches to publicly funded health care.Cuba,on the other hand,has maintained lower levels ofinfant mortality thanmany industrial countries and has eliminated diseases common to developing countries while remaining very poor.Theachievements came with a community-based health system with numerous health workers,highly motivated staff,andclose monitoring and evaluation ofoutcomes.Can Cuba’s model survive the economic

158Spotlight on Costa Rica and Cubaabout providers.Their complaints can gothrough the health system—such as thepoliclinic that coordinates the local healthfacilities,the municipal health council,orhospital administrators.Or they can gothrough political channels—say,to the localrepresentative ofthe People’s Power Assem-bly,which is required to respond.Despitethis monitoring,there is limited direct citi-zen control:participation in administrativeand health councils does not entail muchmore than setting broad targets.447Like-wise,citizens play only a small role in set-ting priorities within the health sector,andbetween health and other sectors.Can Cuba sustain the system?The 1990s were difﬁcult for Cuba.The col-lapse ofthe socialist system in Europe andin the Soviet Union and the tightening ofthe economic embargo by the United Statesled to a severe economic contraction.Cubalost the trading partners that had providedmost ofits imports ofmedicines,food,fuel,and equipment used in agriculture andmining.Between 1988 and 1993 imports ofmedicines fell by more than 60 percent.By1994 agricultural production had fallen byalmost half.Drug shortages persist today.448Government spending on social ser-vices,particularly health care,was pro-engaged in international solidarity missionsraise their proﬁle and contribute to a senseofpride in Cuba’s doctors.Cuba also keeps close track ofwhat’sgoing on in health facilities.Monitoring isstrong,with information ﬂowing in manydirections.The main elements are:•An integrated national health statisticssystem that collects data routinely fromservice providers.Indicators ofparticu-lar concern,such as infant mortality,arecollected with high frequency—someeven daily.•Regular inspection of,and supervisionvisits to,health facilities.•Annual evaluations ofhealth techni-cians on the technical and scientiﬁcresults oftheir work.In addition,a ran-domly selected sample undergoes exter-nal evaluation.•Annual reports by the Ministry ofPub-lic Health and the provincial andmunicipal health directorates to thePeople’s Power Assembly.Monitoring and evaluation go beyondstatistical and expert assessments.Publicdissemination ofhealth indicators,at theend ofeach year,draws citizens into theprocess.In addition,citizens can complaintected,with public spending on healthexceeding 10 percent ofGDP in 2000.Butin real terms,spending had gone down.Health outcome indicators worsened in theearly and mid-1990s,recovering only some-what by the end ofthe decade.As health infrastructure suffered,so didtransport services.Public transport had allbut disappeared by the early 1990s,and fuelshortages limited the use ofprivate cars.Cubans resorted to walking miles to work,and the use ofbicycles skyrocketed.449The economic reversal also appears tobe weakening motivation among staff.Physicians are paid relatively well,earningalmost 15 percent more than the averagenational wage.450But their pay is in localcurrency,with purchasing power decliningsteadily over the past decade.The legaliza-tion ofa separate “dollar economy”hasmade occupations that pay in dollarshighly prized.Stories ofdoctors shirkingtheir formal duties to join this paralleleconomy—driving taxicabs,for example—are common.451Time will tell whether an approach thatrelies on a publicly paid doctor for every150 families can be sustained in times ofeconomic hardship—and with competitionfrom an economy that relies more on thedollar.18_pgs 157-158_Ch08Spot.qxd  8/14/03  3:31 PM  Page 158(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

159Drinking water,sanitation,sewage disposal,electricity,rural roads,and urban transportinﬂuence human development outcomes(crate 1.1).As with education and healthservices,the impact ofinfrastructure ser-vices on human development is direct (e.g.,reducing water-related diseases,which rankamong the top killers ofchildren).Theimpact is also indirect,through economicgrowth.452But like education and health,these services are failing poor people.Focusing on water,sanitation,and elec-tricity services,this chapter uses the Report’sservice delivery framework to ﬁnd out whyand to show how things might be improved.The reform lessons from these services,rep-resenting both network and non-networkservices,are also likely to apply to otherinfrastructure services.For networked services,such as urbanwater and electricity,regulating providersand ensuring that poor people have access toaffordable services are the main reasons forgovernment intervention.This brings thelong route ofaccountability into play.Butpoor citizens have a weak voice because waterand electricity are particularly vulnerable topatronage politics.Providers end up beingmore accountable to policymakers than toclients,which breaks the long route ofaccountability.The solution is to separate the policy-makers from the providers—and to makeproviders more responsive to clients.Dis-persing ownership through decentraliza-tion and private participation,promotingcompetition through benchmarking,ensur-ing alternative access by using independentproviders,and charging for services areways ofseparating policymakers fromproviders and strengthening compacts,client power,and voice.In rural network and non-network set-tings,community and self-provision domi-nate.The policymaker as standard setterand capacity builder in support ofthe clientis missing.To avoid ensuing problems,suchas arsenic in Bangladesh’s rural drinkingwater,policymakers need to support clientsin ensuring service quality and access.Externalities in sanitation in rural,non-network settings are best contained within thevillage or community.So supply-side supportat the household level should be comple-mented with interventions at the communitylevel—be it information about hygiene orsubsidization oflatrines—that are designed tospur household demand and create commu-nity peer pressure for behavior that internal-izes the externalities.In urban settings,wheredemand for sanitation services may be greater,property rights and facilitating privateresponse can support collective efforts.The state of water and sanitation servicesAbout 2 ofevery 10 people in the developingworld were without access to safe water in2000;5 of10 lived without adequate sanita-tion;and 9 of10 lived without their waste-water treated in any way.453There have beengains,but despite the many global commit-ments,notably the U.N.Decade for Waterand Sanitation,access to water and sanitationlags far behind the milestones set in the1980s.Nor do aggregate trends in the 1990sgive comfort (ﬁgure 9.1).The share ofpeoplewith access to these services in Africa andAsia—where the world’s poor are concen-trated—has fallen,remained constant,orincreased only slowly.Innumerable city and town studies con-ﬁrm the UN-Habitat Report’s key messageDrinking water,sanitation,and electricity9chapter19_WDR_Ch09.qxd  8/14/03  10:01 AM  Page 159(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

that water and sanitation services are toooften failing communities.454Full-pressure,“24-7”water supply remains a pipe dreamin many cities.Because a quarter to half(and more) ofurban water supply remainsunaccounted for,many cities are turnedinto leaking buckets (ﬁgure 9.2).The lim-ited number ofnetwork access points mustbe widely shared,which dramaticallyincreases waiting times and often simplyoverwhelms the system.Rural infrastruc-ture often goes to seed:more than a third ofexisting rural infrastructure in South Asia isestimated to be dysfunctional.455Poor people bear a disproportionateshare ofthe impact ofinefﬁcient water andsanitation services.Fewer poor people areconnected to a network.When they do haveaccess,the installation has to be sharedamong many more people (ﬁgure 9.3).Andthe prices they pay are among the highest,generally more than those paid by moreafﬂuent households connected to the pipedsystem (ﬁgure 9.4).The price differential ispartly a result ofinefﬁciencies—theinequitable practice ofsubsidizing pipedwater,lack ofscale economies for indepen-dent providers,or worse,providers takingadvantage ofpoor people’s lack ofchoice.But some ofthe price differential can alsoreﬂect the ﬂexibility and convenience ofservices offered by independent pro-viders—no connection charges or access toquantities ofwater that are more affordablefor poor people.Infrastructure and theaccountability framework for service deliveryCountries are trying different approaches toaddress failing water,sanitation,and electric-ity services.These include decentralizing tolocal governments,private sector participa-tion,regulatory reform,community-drivendevelopment,and small independentproviders.Some approaches try to make ser-vices work for poor people through targetedinterventions.Others seek to improve ser-vices overall—on the premise that makingservices work for all is necessary for makingthem work for poor people.The sameapproach has worked in one setting andfailed in another,and different approacheshave worked in seemingly the same setting.What is needed is a way to think about theinstitutional and political characteristics ofinfrastructure services to understand whatworks where and why.Accountability in infrastructureservicesChapters 3–6 ofthis Report develop a frame-work for analyzing how well the actors in ser-vice delivery—clients and citizens,politiciansand policymakers,and service providers—160WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Figure 9.1Little progress in access to improved water and sanitation, 1990 and 2000019902000AfricaUrbanRuralAsia19902000Latin Americaand theCaribbean25507510019902000019902000AfricaUrbanRuralAsia19902000Latin Americaand theCaribbean25507510019902000PercentPercentWater supply coverage by regionSanitation coverage by regionSource:WHO, UNICEF, and Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council (2000).24168Dhaka0204060Phnom PenhBeijingHong KongJakartaManilaBangkokCalcuttaChennaiDelhiKathmanduKarachiColomboNairobiNakuruHours of wateravailable in a dayPercent of waterunaccounted forSource:Human Settlements Program (2003).Figure 9.224-hour water: a pipe dream19_WDR_Ch09.qxd  8/14/03  10:02 AM  Page 160(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

hold each other accountable within four rela-tionships (ﬁgure 9.5):•Client powerconnects service users withproviders.•Voiceconnects citizenswith politiciansand policymakersthrough the politicalprocess.•Compactsconnect policymakers throughimplicit or explicit contracts with providersresponsible for services.•And management connects providerorganizations with frontline across-the-counter providers.Short route ofaccountability.In a simplemarket transaction,the buyer holds theseller accountable for the product bought,rewards the seller by repeating business,orpenalizes the seller by choosing anotherprovider.This accountability is “short”because the client can hold the providerdirectly accountable,without any interme-diaries.Small,independent providers inwater and sanitation and their clients areusually in such a market relationship.In Dar-es-Salaam,Tanzania,a choleraoutbreak in 1996 forced the sewerage andsanitation department to loosen itsmonopoly on cesspit cleaning and allowprivate providers in.There is now anemerging competitive private market forcesspit cleaning—households can choose aprovider based on price and (easy-to-mon-itor) performance.Besides allowing entryand implementing regulations on sewagedisposal,the city’s role has been small.456But service and market conditions thatautomatically give clients power—throughchoice,ease ofmonitoring,and marketenforceability—are not always present forinfrastructure services.So the route ofaccountability has to be long.Long route ofaccountability.Govern-ments worldwide deem it their responsibil-ity to provide,ﬁnance,regulate,and inother ways inﬂuence infrastructure services.They do it for two good reasons:marketfailures and equity concerns.First,net-worked infrastructure services exhibitDrinking water,sanitation,and electricity1610.0050.010LimaKampalaBandungDar es SalaamWatertruckerUtilityBicyclewatervendordeliveringto non-service areaKiosksWatervendingHouseconnectionHandcartsdelivering tohomesStandpipesdrawingwater frommainsSource:Human Settlements Program (2003).Figure 9.4Alternative sources of water: poor people pay morePrice of water per liter, U.S. dollarsFigure 9.3Water and sanitation bypoorest and richest ﬁfths0Poorest fifthRichest fifth20406080PercentAccra020406080Jakarta0No water atresidence20406080Sharing toiletswith 10 or morehouseholdsSao Paulo~Source:Human Settlements Program (2003).19_WDR_Ch09.qxd  8/14/03  10:02 AM  Page 161(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

economies ofscale,or network externali-ties,that make it technically more efﬁcientto have a single distributor ofthe service.Insanitation the externalities come literallyfrom spillovers.Yes,households in Dar-es-Salaam were willing to pay for improvedsanitation with larger health beneﬁts to thecity.But free-rider problems,where oneperson’s behavior hurts others withimpunity—as in the case ofrunofffromopen defecation in many parts ofAsia andAfrica—require community or governmentintervention.Second,societies care aboutequity,and governments often redistributeresources—such as a lifeline water sub-sidy—to ensure the minimum equitableservice access that markets cannot.Network externalities,collective actionproblems,and distributional goals thusprovide powerful reasons for the govern-ment to be involved.The arrangementsthen are no longer primarily between theclient and the provider,and new account-ability relationships become important.The ﬁrst ofthese arrangements is voice—citizens delegating to politicians the respon-sibility to ensure the infrastructure ser-vices they want.The second is through thecompacts between policymakers andproviders—to design the service deliveryframework,choose a provider,and ensurethat it meets citizen expectations.Voice andcompacts together become the “long route”ofaccountability.In Bangladesh the primeminister and her power minister are,inprinciple,accountable to citizens for theperformance ofthe Power DevelopmentBoard,a corporation owned and operatedby government.The short and long routes ofaccountabil-ity need to work together.Indeed,even forcesspit services in Dar-es-Salaam,govern-ment regulation was necessary to ensure thatthe small private operators complementedthe public provider and complied withsewage disposal guidelines.Effective solu-tions are likely to be a strategic mixture oftheshort and long routes ofaccountability as asystemin which the clients,the policymaker,and the provider are linked in accountabilityrelationships that make services work forpoor people.Why infrastructure services fail poorpeople: patronageBecause the family has been without daytimewater for the past decade,the children have neverseen water come out oftheir home faucets....Thefaucet ﬂows only between midnight and 4 a.m.inmost ofBaryo Kapitolyo.MWSS,you know that.Did you care?Dahli Aspillera,a citizen ofManila,on the eve ofthe privatization ofManila’s public water agency,Metro-Manila Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS),in 1997Where water,sanitation,and electricity arepublicly managed,the accountability to cit-izens is achieved when the state ensures thatutilities,boards,and government depart-ments provide efﬁcient and equitable ser-vices for all citizens,including the poor.When the state is unsuccessful and the voicerelationship is not effective,the long routeofaccountability has failed.In 1997 the MWSS was typical ofserviceutilities,boards,and government depart-ments that consider politicians and policy-makers as their real clients.Politicians—responding to equity concerns or,morelikely,to short-term political gain—oftenkeep prices for infrastructure services wellbelow those for cost recovery.This makesservice providers dependent on politicallymotivated budget transfers for survival—orwhen transfers are not forthcoming,on ser-vice cutbacks that attract no penalties frompolicymakers.State-owned water and electricity pro-viders then cease to function as auton-omous service providers.457They become162WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Figure 9.5Accountability in infrastructure services VoiceCompactThe statePoliticiansPolicymakersCitizens/clientsClient powerNonpoorPoorLongrouteofaccountabilityFrontlineOrganizationsManagementShortrouteCoalitions/inclusionPublic and private utilitiesand providersWater,sanitation,otherservices19_WDR_Ch09.qxd  8/14/03  10:03 AM  Page 162(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

extensions ofpolicymakers.The policy-maker and provider begin to fuse into onerole.When this happens,policymakers canno longer hold providers accountable fordelivering to all citizens,services deterio-rate,and poor citizens as clients are leftpowerless.The dynamics ofthis relationship can beeven more debilitating for poor clients.Over time providers become a strong polit-ical force,inﬂuencing the policymaker.Ineffect,providers capture the policymakingprocess,exerting pressures through orga-nized labor or their ability to control servicedelivery for the politician.With deteriorat-ing service levels,policymakers andproviders ration access.This has an impor-tant implication when lumpy investmentsare needed to gain access to services—whether through an electricity grid,a vil-lage water network,or even a stand-alonesystem,such as tubewells.Citizens or theirgroups respond to rationed access by sup-porting politicians who favor them as theirclients over politicians who push for uni-versal access.This strengthens the ability ofpoliticians to use patronage.The account-ability linking clients,politicians,policy-makers,and providers is displaced bypatron-client relationships—clientelism—on both legs ofthe long route ofaccount-ability (box 9.1).458In such settings,the breakdown in voicefor poor citizens is reinforced by their lossofclient power.Dahli Aspillera’s question—did you care?—reﬂects both a sense that theclient cannot penalize the provider for poorservice and a deeper reality that the longroute ofaccountability has failed the citizen.Iffailure ofvoice is at the root ofweak ser-vice delivery in water,sanitation,and elec-tricity,what are the options for reform? Drinking water,sanitation,and electricity163With patronage,the compact between the politicianand provider—the utility or board—is neither trans-parent nor determined by universal client needs.Politicians exert their control by appointing (and dis-missing) company directors and by providing publicsubsidies to ﬁnance investments and prop up ailingenterprises.In return for this patronage,water com-panies are often obliged to supply political favors inthe form of excess employment,the depressing oftariffs,political targeting of new investments,andthe distribution of contracts on the basis of politicalcriteria.The consequences:spiraling costs,low ser-vice quality,and precarious ﬁnances.The scarcity ofresources for investment leaves much of the popu-lace without adequate services and forces them torely on expensive or inconvenient alternatives.The clientelist model broadly describes the poli-tics of urban and rural regional utilities in both waterand electricity sectors.It also applies to local admin-istrations in charge of urban or village-basedservices (funding of piped networks or communitytoilets or even public investment in deep tubewells).Source:Foster (2002).BOX 9.1Clientelism in service deliveryPatronage weakening accountability in the citizen-provider chain PoliticalfavorsOperationalsubsidies/Appointmentof directorsArtificiallydepressedtariffsPoorquality ofservicePoliticiansConnected populationUnconnected populationHigh pricesOverstaffingEmployeesUntenderedcontractsContractorsUtility company19_WDR_Ch09.qxd  8/14/03  10:03 AM  Page 163(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Urban water networksWho is the Water Board accountable to?Question asked ofthe Managing Director ofthe Hyderabad Water Board by a consumer,Hyderabad,September 2002In cities and towns,where scale economiesprevail,water systems have major networksuppliers—generally a public sector provider,such as the Lagos water board in Nigeria,or asmall municipal water department,as in Cha-pai Nawabganj in Bangladesh.Some oftheseproviders belong to local governments—as inthe case ofthe Johannesburg water utility;some to a state government—as is commonin India;and some—like MWSS in Manila—to central governments.For all,the relevantquestions are whether there is a clear delin-eation ofroles between the policymaker andthe provider—and whom the provider isaccountable to,the policymaker or the client?When voice and politics fail,the distinctionbetween the two is blurred,and the provider isaccountable to the policymaker.Four reform strategies can potentially sep-arate policymakers and providers:decentral-izing assets,using private participation inoperations,charging for services,and relyingon independent providers to give clientschoice.The ﬁrst two aim to inﬂuence com-pacts,the second two to strengthen clientpower.All are politically difﬁcult to imple-ment.That is not surprising,since strongpolitical forces—not technocratic failures—blur the roles ofpolicymakers and providers.The issue is whether these strategies can pro-vide incentives to remove patronage and com-pensate for the weak voice ofpoor people.Strengthening the compact:decentralizing assetsDevolving responsibilities to different tiers ofpolicymakers and separating powers betweenthem can create the right incentives toimprove service delivery.First,by having ser-vice and political boundaries better coincide,decentralization can strengthen voice andaccountability.Second,when the center is incharge ofboth regulatory and service deliveryresponsibilities,it has few incentives to holditselfaccountable.Devolving services toanother tier ofpolicymaker triggers incentivesmore compatible with having the center (or anupper-tier government) oversee the regulatoryframework.Finally,devolution creates anopportunity to benchmark performance anduse ﬁscal resources and reputation as rewardsto support efﬁcient service provision.The con-testability for resources in this context requiresa tier with ﬁscal capacity and without serviceprovision responsibilities—appropriate forthe center (or a state in a federal system).Devolving responsibilities to local gov-ernments has had mixed results in waterand sanitation,often leading to the loss ofscale economies,eroding commercial via-bility by excessive fragmentation,and evenconstitutional conﬂicts between municipal-ities and upper-tier governments.459Thehistorical experience ofindustrial countriesoffers lessons for addressing these problems(box 9.2).164WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004In France water assets have historically beendevolved to the commune—the lowest tier ofgovernment.Clusters of communes have inte-grated the industry by delegating water andsanitation services “upward”to private or semi-public companies.The functional boundaries ofthe companies cut across several communes,which continue to own the assets but contractout the management of services.In the United States water and sanitationassets are also devolved to local governments.Where local governments have been carved upinto small political jurisdictions and individualwater works are impractical,privately ownedcompanies have emerged to provide regionalservices covering several local governments.Examples include Elizabeth and Hackensack,both in New Jersey.Interestingly,for France and some areas in theUnited States,the limited capacity of the smallerlocal governments provided the incentives for pri-vate companies to serve clusters of political juris-dictions.In both France and the United States themultijurisdictional coverage prevents the waterprovider from being captured by any one localbody—thus maintaining the separation fromlocal policymakers.The approach was different in England andthe Netherlands.At the outset of the 20th cen-tury in both countries,oversight and direct pro-vision of water services were in the hands oflocal authorities.In the Netherlands these wereunder company structures,mostly owned andrun by municipalities,but many were under pri-vate operation if not ownership.In England thenational government consolidated the localwater systems into regional bodies,movingfrom 1,400 in World War II to 187 in 1974 and 10in the 1980s,all eventually privatized.In theNetherlands,also under central governmentmandate,the municipal companies were con-verted to regional companies to support theexpansion of services to rural areas.But thecompanies remained under the ownership ofmunicipalities and provinces.Sources:Lorrain (1992);Seidenstat,Haarmeyer,andHakim

Fragmentation and the loss ofscaleeconomies can be partly addressed by permit-ting interjurisdictional agreements.In theFrench syndicatmodel,municipal jurisdic-tions can cede the right to provide water andsanitation services to a company jointly ownedby several local authorities.Bolivia’s water lawexplicitly allows for multi-municipal compa-nies.Colombia empowered its regulator toenforce mergers ofnonviable local water agen-cies,but ironically exempted the smallest ofthe municipalities that would have beneﬁtedmost from this rule.Brazil’s state companieswere created through voluntary agreementswith municipalities,ﬁnanced by central funds.These examples suggest an importantapproach for aligning general decentraliza-tion with sectoral priorities.When authorityis being decentralized,a window usuallyopens for central government to inﬂuencethe restructuring oflocal services.Decentral-ization gives the center the ability to negotiatethe restructuring ofdevolved assets throughﬁscal incentives—say,by deciding to retainthe liabilities while devolving only the assets.Where devolution has already happened,the center can provide incentives such asﬁscal grants to subnational governmentsthat are dependent on milestones ofinstitu-tional reform.Australia’s federal govern-ment provided grants to states to reform thewater sector.The South African govern-ment is also using central ﬁscal incentives tosupport municipal restructuring and toinﬂuence reform ofurban services,includ-ing water and sanitation.India’s federalgovernment is exploring a similar policyinstrument—the City Challenge Fund—tocreate incentives for general urban reform,including municipal services.Such ﬁscal incentives are more effective ifallocated competitively to local tiers ofgov-ernment.But this requires information so thecenter can compare the performance ofdif-ferent local governments,promoting compe-tition and accountability.It also requires thatthe policy and legal framework enable localgovernments to have the ﬂexibility to reformservice delivery—to form regional compa-nies and use contracting,for example.Coun-tries such as Pakistan and South Africa thathave recently embarked on decentralizationhave adopted such legislation.The bottom line:upper-tier governmentscan inﬂuence the design ofcompacts at thelocal level through legislation and incentives.However,as demonstrated by experience inLatin America,decentralization processeshave not always been designed with sufﬁ-cient care to allow these kinds ofbeneﬁts tobe reaped.The success ofmanaging servicereforms during decentralization will dependon whether broader decentralization policiescan ensure that local politicians and policy-makers bear the consequences ofpolicy deci-sions.Ensuring that decentralization canseparate policymakers and providers at thelocal level requires that it also separate rolesand responsibilities ofthe different tiers ofgovernment (chapter 10).Without that sepa-ration,decentralization may simply transferpatronage to local levels.Strengthening the compact: using private participation in operationsOver the past decade,private participationhas grown signiﬁcantly in water,sanitation,and electricity in different forms and acrossmany regions (box 9.3).In general,privateparticipation in infrastructure has beenadvocated for many reasons,includingaccessing management expertise and privateinvestment and introducing incentives in theoperations ofinfrastructure services.Privateparticipation is also a direct way ofseparat-ing policymakers and service providersthrough two aspects ofthe accountabilitychain—compacts and voice.In the design ofcompacts,private pro-viders generally require explicit contractsthat deﬁne up front the service responsibili-ties ofthe provider and the policymaker,theregulatory and tariffparameters,and issuesofaccess by poor households.In addition,the process ofcontracting private providerscan strengthen the voice channel,particu-larly ifadvocacy groups and public informa-tion mechanisms are involved in the process.Indeed,service delivery standards and ser-vices for poor people are often explicit in thepolicy debate on private participation inwater and sanitation.In many industrial countries the involve-ment ofthe private sector in service deliv-ery enabled governments to develop theDrinking water,sanitation,and electricity16519_WDR_Ch09.qxd  8/14/03  10:04 AM  Page 165(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Private investment has been far higher in electricity than in water andsanitation.Not surprisingly,the decline in private investment in the latenineties was more pronounced in electricity.In both sectors,the impactof “large deals”and country speciﬁc changes are visible—reﬂected alsoin the geographic concentration—East Asia and Latin America—of pri-vate investment.Finally,in electricity privatization dominates;in water,management contract and concessions—public ownership—remainsthe norm.Source:World Bank,PPI Project Database.BOX 9.3Trends in private participation: water,sewerage,and electricityInvestment commitments in projects with private participation in developing countries, 1990–2001024681002040602001 U.S. dollars (billions)2001 U.S. dollars (billions)Water and sewerage projectsElectricity projectsCumulative investment, water and sewerage projects (total $40 billion)Water and sewerage projects by type (total 202 projects)Electricity projects by type (total 832 projects)Cumulative investment, electricity projects(total $213 billion)1990199119921993199419951996199719981999AguasArgentinaconcessionManila water system concessionsChileprivatizationBrazil20002001199019911992199319941995199619971998199920002001All otherdevelopingcountriesSub-Saharan Africa1%Middle East andNorth Africa0%South Asia1%Europe andCentral Asia8%East Asiaand Pacific38%LatinAmericaand theCaribbean52%Sub-SaharanAfrica2%Middle East andNorth Africa0%South Asia10%Europe andCentral Asia9%East Asiaand Pacific32%LatinAmericaand theCaribbean43%Concessions44%Management andlease contracts20%Greenfieldprojects28%Divestitures8%Divestitures39%Concessions4%Management andlease contracts1%Greenfieldprojects56%166WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 200419_WDR_Ch09.qxd  8/14/03  10:04 AM  Page 166(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

capacity and political setting to regulate,price,and manage water in public and pri-vate contexts (box 9.4).But in today’s devel-oping countries private participation is beingﬂung into a context ofinstitutional rigidity,not necessarily conducive to the organicgrowth offormal private participation.Using private provision to drive a wedge intopatronage makes managing private partici-pation intensely political—but potentiallypowerful for increasing accountability.The proofofthis potential is already evi-dent.Formal private participation in waterand sanitation has led to greater demand foraccountability—this,despite accounting for asmall part oftotal investment in water andsanitation.During the 1990s private invest-ment accounted for only 15 percent oftotalinvestment in water and sanitation,coveringless than 10 percent ofthe world’s population.Even in Latin America,where private provi-sion has made the greatest inroads in thewater sector,it only covers 15 percent ofthecontinent’s urban population.460In addition,in contrast to electricity,for example,publicownership and not divestiture ofassetsremains the norm in the sector.Ulitmately,like decentralization,privateprovision offers an opportunity to inﬂuencethe relationships ofaccountability.And likedecentralization,its success depends ondesign and implementation (box 9.5).Experi-ence so far suggests that regulation and infor-mation—two interlinked parts ofoverall sec-tor reform—are important in successfullyimplementing private sector participation inwater,sanitation,and electricity sectors and inpromoting greater voice in service delivery.Regulation.A regulatory system in thisReport’s framework is best deﬁned along thedimensions ofaccountability between the pol-icymaker and the provider—delegation ofresponsibilities and ﬁnance,informationabout the performance ofthe provider,andenforcement (chapter 3).The regulator couldbe responsible for speciﬁc elements oftheaccountability chain—just providing informa-tion on performance or also ensuring enforce-ment.Sometimes the policymaker is the regu-lator,and sometimes a dedicated third partyhas this responsibility.Sometimes even anassociation ofproviders can self-regulate.Whichever method is followed,the regulatoryDrinking water,sanitation,and electricity167England.In London private companies sup-plied water for more than 400 years with littlegovernment restriction on entry.Companiescompeted against each other,invested inservice and quality innovations,and increasedhousehold connections.By the 19th centuryLondon’s extensive water system helped makethat city “one of the best housed and healthiestcities in Europe,with a death rate lower thanbirth rate by about 1800,at a time when mostEuropean cities were devourers of men.”Ninety-ﬁve percent of London residents received pipedsupply from the private companies,and a major-ity had direct home connection.Technological change led to signiﬁcantprice competition,industry consolidation,andhigher prices.And the improved water supplyincreased demand for ﬂush toilets,whichcreated problems of sewage removal.Parliament responded with regulation,and by1908 the private system was nationalized.(In the1980s England shifted back to privateprovision.)Holland.Between 1853 and 1920 the watersector was dominated by private water supplycompanies,which were then progressivelytaken over by municipalities and operated aspublic utilities.The amalgamation waspromoted by central regulation and facilitatedby municipal politics.A major motivation was touse the companies to deliver services moreregionally to rural areas.By the time the publicsector took over,principles of economic man-agement of water services had become wellembedded in the political system.Arms-lengthmanagement of public utilities by municipalitiesbecame the norm.United States.Between 1800 and 1900,U.S.cities experienced a tremendous growth ofwater works.Initially dominated by private own-ers,half of them were public by 1900.The shiftto public ownership emerged because of con-tracting problems between municipalities andcompanies over water for ﬁre ﬁghting.The difﬁ-culties of establishing contracts when citieswere growing rapidly,and several urban conﬂa-grations,offered opportunities for both privatecompanies and governments to evade perfor-mance targets or force renegotiations ofcontracts.A lack of metering and direct charg-ing led to conﬂicts over ﬁscal transfers frommunicipalities to companies.Not surprisingly,public ownership increased,and with it the pub-lic system inherited the tradition of managingand regulating water as an economic good.France.Starting with private provision ofwater at the local government level and main-taining it from the mid-1600s onward,Franceevolved toward public ownership and privateprovision through different types ofmanagement and lease contracts.The reasons:scale issues (small local authorities),the historyof the French legal system,and the role of voicein controlling policymakers.The issue of ﬁreﬁghting did not come up in France,perhapsbecause cities were built with vastly differentmaterials and densities.Sources:Tynan (2002),Schwartz and Maarten(2002),Crocker and Mastens (2002),and Lorrain(1992).BOX 9.4Private participation—in history19_WDR_Ch09.qxd  8/14/03  10:05 AM  Page 167(c) The

process has to separate policymaker andprovider and preserve its own independence.Organizing regulation: one size does not ﬁtall.Where voice is strong and supported byan effective legal system,the policymakersand the judiciary do the regulating.In France,where the compact for water is betweenmunicipal policymakers and a private com-pany,regulation is done primarily throughmunicipal monitoring ofcontracts,withsome support from central authorities.In countries without a tradition ofsepa-rating policymakers and providers and withdiscretionary policymaking,credible regula-tion requires a third party—an agency—toset or interpret regulatory rules.Several for-mal safeguards can support the indepen-dence ofa regulatory agency from politicalinﬂuence.461Some examples:earmarkingfunds for the regulatory agency,hiring stafffrom the market without being restricted bycivil service rules (competence and capacityare important elements ofgaining credibilityand independence),ensuring that the hiringand ﬁring ofregulators are protected fromthe political interference ofthe executive andlegislative branches,and not linking theterms ofstaffto electoral cycles.A multi-tiered governmental structureoffers additional scope for protecting the inde-pendence ofa regulator by placing it at thenational level,or at the state level ifpolicymak-ing and provision are done at the local level.Another option in a multi-tiered governmentis to use local regulation but have the appealsprocess at a different level.In the United Statesthe Constitution provides an overall frame-work for property rights while state regulatorycommissions oversee the operations ofpri-vately owned local utilities.Local governmentsregulate public utilities directly.Regulation and sector reform.The account-ability framework clariﬁes the conditionsunder which a regulator will be effective insupporting sector reforms.Just as account-ability is blurred ifany one ofits relationshipsis broken (see chapter 3),the effectiveness ofa regulator is abridged ifdelegation ofresponsibilities and ﬁnance between the stateand the provider is incomplete.That is thecase in the electricity sector in some states inIndia.In other words,an independent regula-tor is needed to enforce the separationbetween policymaker and provider,but iftheseparation is not initiated through generalreform to begin with,the regulator may wellbe ineffective.A regulator cannot substitutefor broader sector reforms.At the same time an effective regulator canhelp sustain sector reform.A recent study ofabout 1,000 concessions in Latin Americashowed that even a moderately well-func-168WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004In the 1990s Argentina embarked on one of thelargest privatization campaigns in the world aspart of a structural reform plan.The programincluded local water companies coveringapproximately 30 percent of the country’smunicipalities.Child mortality fell by 5–7percent in areas that privatized their water ser-vices.The largest gains were seen in the poorestmunicipalities,where child mortality fell by 24percent.Overall,privatization of water servicesprevented approximately 375 deaths of youngchildren each year.Aggregate data from other sources on thedistribution of new water connection byincome quintile from three countries in LatinAmerica conﬁrm the results of the pro-poorimpact of private sector services.As the datashow,25–30 percent of the network expansionwas targeted at the lowest 20 percent of theincome proﬁle.Responding to the need for alternatives forreaching poor people,one of the Manila conces-sionaires has developed a system for water deliv-ery in densely populated,hard-to-reach slumareas.In the Bayan Tubig (“Water for the Commu-nity”) program,the use of appropriate technologi-cal standards,client participation in maintenance,and community-based organizations in interme-diation and mapping of the network reducedwater costs for poor families by up to 25 percent.To increase affordability,the concessionaire hasintroduced an interest-free repayment schemeover a period of 6 to 24 months.Between 1991and 2001,the program provided water connec-tions to more than 50,000 households—thisdespite the fact that the contract of one of theManila concessionaires is under review.Source:Galiani,Gertler,and Schargrodsky (2002);Water and Sanitation Program (WSP-AF) (2003).BOX 9.5Private participation in water and sanitation can save poor people’s lives,and money0Poorest23Income quintile4Richest2015105302535New ConnectionsPercentBoliviaArgentinaChileDistribution of new connections followingprivate sector participation in water andsanitation services Source:Foster (2002).19_WDR_Ch09.qxd  8/14/03  10:05 AM  Page 168(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

tioning regulator can temper opportunisticrenegotiations ofcontracts.462The study con-cludes that where a regulatory body exists in acountry,the probability ofa renegotiation is17 percent;where none exists,the probabilityis 60 percent.Regulating the public sector.Sector regula-tion is often discussed in the context ofpri-vate sector participation.But issues ofmonopoly behavior and service performanceare also relevant for public sector provision—perhaps even more,because the contractsbetween the policymaker and the publicprovider are often not explicit.Independentregulation ofpublic providers is thereforeequally important.But unless publicproviders have operational ﬂexibility and arebrought under explicit compacts—andunless all the relationships ofaccountabilityare applied—it is not clear how regulation ofthe public providers would have an impacton service standards.In particular,becausemost ofthe instruments ofmodern regula-tion are based on ﬁnancial incentives,in theabsence ofuser charges regulation ofpublicproviders would be ineffective.In Chile pub-lic sector regulation was introduced in thecontext ofsector reforms,which includedgreater provider autonomy in operations andeconomic pricing ofwater.This helped cat-alyze regulatory capacity in the public sec-tor—an important asset,now that Chile hasprivatized water services.The role ofinformation.With private provi-sion more needs to be done to deliver on thedemand for greater voice—informing com-munities about the why and how ofprivatesector contracting.A public opinion poll inPeru found support for privatization ofelec-tricity among only 21 percent ofthe citizens.But when informed that privatization was tobe undertaken through a transparent processand tariffincreases would be regulated,sup-port increased to 60 percent.463In Manila theconcession process was preceded by a wide-spread public campaign by President Ramos,who convened “Water Summits”to bringtogether different stakeholders.464In SouthAfrica Johannesburg’s water managementcontract was also undertaken after signiﬁ-cant—and often difﬁcult—consultation withcommunities,labor unions,and other interestgroups.Neither process was ﬂawless,but bothopened the door to greater accountability.Anopen process is needed to broaden the partici-pation ofcommunities in the policy debateon private provision—otherwise narrowinterest groups can capture the informationand representation.Community involvement is also essentialin the regulatory process—but it has not beensufﬁciently encouraged.A review ofurbanwater utilities in Latin America and Africaconcludes that giving consumers little infor-mation about the process ofreform and tariffsetting—and limiting their opportunity forcomment before taking regulatory deci-sions—weaken the regulatory process andthe credibility ofreform,and make tariffchanges—however justiﬁed—difﬁcult toimplement.465Organizing consumers is,however,not aneasy task.There are major free-rider (andrelated ﬁnancing) problems in developingcountries that prevent consumers from orga-nizing themselves to a degree where they canbe an articulate voice in the regulatoryprocess.The problem is even more severe forpoor consumers.In industrialized countries,relatively well-developed consumer associa-tions perform this role reasonably effectively.Where competent and effective consumerassociations are absent,the asymmetrybetween consumers and providers becomesmore acute,and the regulator risks being cap-tured by the provider.Examples exist ofregulatory bodies engag-ing communities—especially poor communi-ties—more actively.In Jamaica the regulatorreaches out to communities through localchurches;in some cases in Brazil special con-sultative or advisory bodies have been created;and in Peru regulators have made extensiveuse ofthe radio to engage and communicatewith communities.466But these are few exam-ples only—much more needs to be learnedabout how to organize and access communi-ties in the regulation ofservices.Managing private participation also re-quires information on how private playersare performing relative to their contractand the performance ofother public andprivate providers.This information,whichis critical for regulators,also strengthens theDrinking water,sanitation,and electricity16919_WDR_Ch09.qxd  8/14/03  10:06 AM  Page 169(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

relationship between citizens,politicians,andpolicymakers.For private provision to have acatalytic impact on the sector,information isessential on the performance ofboth thepublic and private sectors.But too little infor-mation has been available on the perfor-mance ofthe public sector and through fewcredible sources.Leveling the playing ﬁeldbetween public and private providers—asdiscussed later—and benchmarking theirperformance are essential in getting the bestout ofprivate participation in the sector.Overall,the impact ofprivate sector partic-ipation is best leveraged within a broaderreform context—greater separation ofpolicy-makers and providers for all public providers;greater participation ofcommunities in theprocess ofprivate participation and in theregulatory framework;and greater use ofbenchmarking ofboth public and privateproviders.The Australian approach is in-structive.An enabling framework and anational competition law level the playingﬁeld for all public and private providers.Sec-toral legislation provides guidelines for serviceprovision.The central government providesﬁscal incentives to support change at the statelevel.A variety ofdelivery approaches are sup-ported—corporatization (Melbourne),man-agement contract (Adelaide),vertically inte-grated public utility (Sydney),multi-utility(Canberra).Regulation differs between statesand is backed by independent regulatoryagencies as well as benchmarking donethrough an association ofwater providers.Strengthening client power:charging for servicesUser charges provide operational autonomyfor the provider,support client power,andelicit greater accountability from the state (box9.6).Without access to enough revenues fromthe clients,service providers depend on thepolicymaker for ﬁscal resources to maintainservice provision.In addition,ifthe seller isnot dependent on the buyer for at least somepart ofrevenues,the provider will have littleincentive to respond to the client.At the sametime,given the politics ofwater pricing,imple-menting user charges can quickly elicit a con-sumer response—as in Johannesburg,Manila,and very visibly in Cochabamba,Bolivia.Implementing user charges.Drawing on thepower ofuser charges to leverage accountabil-ity in service delivery requires,as discussedearlier,effective regulation to address mono-poly provision.But more importantly,the crit-ical policy issue is how to increase tariffs.Thereare two implementation issues:the ﬁrst is syn-chronizing tariffs with quality improvements,and the second is ensuring that there is a safetynet to safeguard basic affordability.In many countries,bringing the tariffs tocost-recovery levels would require signiﬁcantadjustment and rebalancing oftariffs amongresidential,business,and industrial cus-tomers.In Indian cities the charges on resi-dential users are less than a tenth ofthe oper-ating and maintenance costs.Industrial userspay ten times more but are below the bench-mark for operating and maintenance costs intwo-thirds ofthe metropolitan cities and 80percent ofsmaller cities.467Even ifthere is awillingness to charge,how can the transitionto prices be managed?Charging cannot be assessed independentofthe broader policy framework and thecredibility ofservice providers.Policymakersare obviously concerned that services will notimprove enough to justify the price increases.Central to a price increase is what comesﬁrst—the increases or service improvement?Guinea entered a lease contract for water ser-vices in its major towns and cities in 1989.During the ﬁrst six years ofthe contract,thegovernment subsidized a declining share ofthe private operator’s costs while tariffs wereadjusted gradually toward cost recovery,170WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Treating water as an economic good and charg-ing for services enabled France and the Nether-lands to use private provision to jump-start thesector’s development.In France the private sec-tor remains the major service provider of waterand sanitation services.In the Netherlands thesystem shifted from the private to the publicsector.But in both countries charging users forwater remained the norm,which enabledproviders to sustain service delivery at arm’slength from local government and gave themgreater incentives to be responsive to the needsof the clients.Sources:Lorrain (1992);Blokland,Braadbaart,andSchwartz (1999).BOX 9.6Charging forwater—in history19_WDR_Ch09.qxd  8/14/03  10:06 AM  Page 170(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

which avoided a major tariffshock.Thisjump-started the move to cost recovery andbetter service delivery.It also gave the reformcredibility in a region that had little experi-ence with private provision.468For variousreasons the lease contract expired in 1999 andwas not renewed,but the pricing strategyremains relevant for other countries.Similarly,subsidies to poor people couldbe better targeted and designed,whichwould enable user charges to be imple-mented overall.Chile has a nationallyfunded household water subsidy.Colombiauses geographic targeting.South Africa has anational lifeline tariffsystem that guaranteeseach household 6 kiloliters ofwater amonth.469Given the substantial divergencebetween piped water prices and the high costofthe inferior alternatives that many ofthepoorest are forced to use,there is often astrong case for giving highest priority to con-nection subsidies rather than subsidizing theuse ofwater by those who already enjoyaccess to the piped network.Connectionsubsidies also have the advantage that theyare easier to target (since lacking access toservice is already a strong indicator ofpoverty) and cheaper to administer (sincerelatively large one-time payments areinvolved).Generally it is more efﬁcient tosubsidize the connection costs for low-income households,but there are alternativeoptions for designing connection and con-sumption charges that beneﬁt poor people.Ultimately,tariffadjustment and subsidymechanisms are technocratic tools that canbe designed and applied in many ways.Whatis critical is to turn payments for services intoa political tool for reducing patronage andstrengthening client power ofpoor people.Strengthening client power: relyingon independent providersAs the example ofpit operators in Dar-es-Salaam suggests,small independent pro-viders are a common feature in providingwater and sanitation services across incomegroups.Their organization varies fromhousehold vendors ofwater,small networkproviders,and private entrepreneurs to coop-eratives.In some cases they are the primarysuppliers,and in others they supplement theformal provider.In some cases they are partofa competitive market,and in others theyare controlled by a few groups.Enhancing the role ofindependentproviders as part ofthe short route ofaccountability is a key policy challenge.Howcan this be achieved?470By recognizing inde-pendent providers and giving them legal sta-tus,by ensuring that network providers arenot given exclusive supply,by enablinggreater partnership between formal publicand private network providers and smallindependents,by ensuring that the regulatoryframework for network providers gives theﬂexibility to enable contracting with inde-pendent providers,by enabling small-scaleprovider associations and working with theseumbrella bodies to introduce appropriatelevels ofregulation,and by enabling poorpeople to gain access to multiple independentproviders while keeping their regulationmore focused on health and issues related togroundwater depletion.Ofparticular concern is the effect ofbringing in a formal private provider in anarea dominated by independent providers.This issue was not addressed in the design ofthe Cochabamba contract—where the pri-vate provider was given exclusivity rights—and it contributed to the contract’s cancella-tion.471In reality,ifcoverage targets aredeﬁned in such a way that they can be metwith the services ofsmall independentproviders,the operator will have an incentiveto encourage their involvement.Rural areas:network and non-network systemsRural settings are complex in their settlementpatterns,ranging from dense settlements inSouth Asia to dispersed communities in manyAfrican countries.Suppliers include house-hold systems in Bangladesh,water vendors inLaos,and community-managed local pipedwater systems in Ghana.Across all situations,the client-provider link is the norm.Under-standing why the long route ofaccountabilityis needed to support this client power,andhow this can be done,are the main servicedelivery challenges in rural areas.Community-managed networksIn countries as diverse as India and Kenya,water boards or engineering departmentsDrinking water,sanitation,and electricity17119_WDR_Ch09.qxd  8/14/03  10:07 AM  Page 171(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

have traditionally been responsible fordelivering water services to rural communi-ties.Top-down in their approach,with littleskill in community mobilization,andbacked by ﬁscal support from central gov-ernment,the boards scaled up physicalinvestment.But they had little success inensuring sustainable operations and main-tenance.Indeed,these boards face the sameproblems ofstate capture inherent in thepatronage model ofservice delivery.Given the failures oftop-down institu-tions,some countries are shifting to com-munity-managed systems—often supportedby donors,as in India and Ghana.Commu-nities are involved in the design and man-agement oftheir water systems,paying foroperations and maintenance costs.Govern-ments,generally central governments,pay asigniﬁcant part ofthe capital costs.Donor-funded project management units,backedby not-for-proﬁt organizations,often formthe technical and organizational backboneofthese systems.The client-based model puts the client atthe center ofthe accountability relation-ship,but many challenges remain in scalingit up.472•Communities require technical supportin the medium to long run to managewater systems,and donor-funded pro-ject management units are not wellsuited for this.•Communities pay for current operatingcosts,but replenishing capital invest-ments and covering higher tariffs—topay for rising power costs,for example—are not easily managed through groupcontributions.•Communities are not homogeneous—problems ofexclusion and elite capturecan be the same as in government sys-tems.And different communities mayhave differing abilities to form cohesivegroups.•Efﬁcient technologies that require scaleeconomies are not selected because ofthe focus on village-level associations.Supporting client provisionThree approaches—local governments,re-gional utilities,and independent providers—provide examples ofinstitutional mecha-nisms for supporting community-based sys-tems.They are all “works in progress,”andlearning from them will offer insights onhow to advance rural community-based sys-tems ofdelivery.Local governments can form the institu-tional and ﬁnancial support for expandingcommunity-based systems.With access to atax base,local governments can provideresources to cover periodic capital expendi-ture,provide temporary ﬁscal support tocommunities to adjust to economic shocks,and facilitate access to technical assistance.Uganda and South Africa provide examplesofarrangements in which local govern-ments are part ofa larger ﬁscal decentral-ization program with own resources andgreater autonomy.Local governments thusstrengthened can support community-based programs.Even in India,where localpanchayatsdo not have as much autonomy,the relations between local governmentsand user groups are evolving.Where neigh-boring small towns have effective providers,these can be contracted in by rural localgovernments to support their communities.In Côte d’Ivoire a national utility run bya private partner has responsibilities forurban centers and smaller towns.Thenational utility uses cross subsidies—withthe capital city providing the ﬁscal sur-plus—to support the smaller urban centers.Expansion ofits responsibilities to ruralareas is now being tried.The early lessonshave not been successful but the approach isstill evolving.473Finally,communities can contract with athird party or an independent provider tomanage local network systems.In Chinaformal cooperatives (rural companies) runon commercial principles with very highcost recovery.474In several African countriesvillage entrepreneurs manage water systemsunder contract.In East Asia small indepen-dent providers are being organized to takeon operational responsibility on a conces-sion basis.In each case,the process is orga-nized through group consultation andendorsement.While small systems can becontracted by community organizations,villagewide systems may again require thesupport ofpolicymakers at the local level.172WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 200419_WDR_Ch09.qxd  8/14/03  10:07 AM  Page 172(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Self-provision.Households managing wellsand hand pumps are common in large partsofrural Asia and Africa.Nowhere is self-provision more dramatically showcasedthan in Bangladesh,where shallow aquifersand the market provision ofhand pumpsenabled households to directly managewater services and replace pathogen-conta-minated surface water with groundwater.Service delivery improved—less waitingtime,no quantity limits,and the conve-nience ofhousehold connection.And thehealth impact,which included a decline indiarrhea-related deaths,was remarkable.Missing was any attempt to monitorwater quality.Finding arsenic in thegroundwater caught everyone by surprise.The government had withdrawn from therural water sector,assuming that access wasnow fully addressed by the private marketand household efforts directly.In addition,in a unitary system ofgovernment,therewas no local government to respond to thecrisis.In rural Bangladesh today,a policy-maker is needed to support communities,manage externalities,and understand thetechnological choices for addressing thearsenic crisis (box 9.7).More broadly,for acollective good such as the monitoring ofwater quality,a partnership between clientsand providers will not sufﬁce;policymakersare needed to support communitiesSanitationPolicy issues in sanitation need to be dis-cussed in the context ofthe private and pub-lic goods dimensions ofthe sector.To theextent it is primarily a client-provider rela-tionship,households invest in sanitationsystems and contract independent providersfor the removal ofexcreta.To the extent thepublic goods dimensions are dominant,pol-icymakers need to support collective actionto change behavior at the household andcommunity levels,and organize commoninfrastructure for excreta removal.Access to sanitation services has oftenbeen seen as an issue ofsubsidizing latrinesand prescribing latrine technology.Thissupply-driven approach,emphasizing theﬁscal and engineering aspects ofsanitation,has failed.In response,some countries havebeen shifting toward “complete sanita-tion”—focusing on community and house-hold behavior and sanitation practices.475This involves breaking the fecal-oral chainby encouraging households to changebehavior—shifting away from open defeca-tion,washing hands,keeping food andwater covered,using safe water,focusing onDrinking water,sanitation,and electricity173The arsenic contamination of shallow aquifersmay be undoing the success of rural drinkingwater provision in Bangladesh.While the num-ber of individuals showing symptoms of arsenicpoisoning is still low—despite the high concen-tration of arsenic in the water—between 25 and30 million people may be at risk in the future.The ﬁrst response to the crisis bygovernment and many donors was denial.Thiswas followed by an effort to test all watersources and hand pumps.There were varioustechnological and logistical problems—which isnot surprising in view of the fact that arseniccontamination of this scale has not been facedanywhere in the world.These problems werefurther complicated by a lack of coordinationand blurring of roles among government,donors,and nongovernmental organizations(NGOs).The efforts so far have revealed that surfacewater does not contain arsenic and that not allaquifers are contaminated.Government,donors,and NGOs are advocating several options:shift-ing to alternative water sources,including somesurface sources;sharing of uncontaminatedtubewells in villages;sinking deep tubewells inpublic areas;and promoting household ﬁlteringtechnologies.The latter,if successful,would pre-serve the use of shallow tubewells—decentral-ized,household means of water access—thathave deﬁned the “water miracle”of Bangladesh.In all of this,little effort was made to understandthe preferences of rural households.A WSP-BRAC (Water and SanitationProgram–Bangladesh Rural Advancement Com-mittee) team undertook a comprehensive sur-vey of household preferences for differentapproaches to arsenic mitigation in selectedareas of rural Bangladesh.The results reveal thatcommunities place a high premium on conve-nience.Unless the alternatives are as convenientas the current hand pumps,the shift to dugwells,well-sharing,and other mechanism maynot work.Indeed they have not yet beensuccessful as solutions.Communities strongly indicated apreference and willingness to pay forcentralized,community-based ﬁltering systems,such as local piped-water systems with a centralﬁltering point for chemical and biological conta-minants.The piped water network systemsintroduced in the Bogra area by the Rural Devel-opment Academy suggest the potential of suchsystems in Bangladesh.This has been conﬁrmedby preliminary data,which show the cost effec-tiveness of piped water in settlements that have300 or more households.If implementedbroadly,this approach would dramaticallychange the nature of water institutions in ruralBangladesh—a change that communities arewilling to undertake.Source:Ahmad and others (2002).BOX 9.7Fighting arsenic by listening to rural communities19_WDR_Ch09.qxd  8/14/03  10:08 AM  Page 173(c) The International Bank

children’s hygiene behavior and maintain-ing a clean environment.The use ofhygienic latrines is a result ofthis process ofchanging behavior.Because the health impact ofa house-hold’s sanitation practices is affected notonly by the household’s behavior but also bythe practices ofthe community,there is acollective action problem.The provider’srole in ensuring information and social sup-port to households through communitystructures becomes critical.Success dependson making people see themselves as a com-munity,where every member’s behavioraffects the other—a daunting challenge andperhaps the reason why sanitation hasalways lagged behind demand for water.A participatory focus in rural areasBecause communities need to manage sani-tation collectively,innovative participatoryapproaches are required to generatedemand for it,especially in dispersed settle-ments.The shift from open to ﬁxed-pointdefecation may be motivated by health,safety,and privacy concerns—issues ofimportance to women,who bear much ofthe burden ofpoor sanitation practices.Inthe approach practiced by Village Educa-tion Resource Center (VERC) and Wat-erAid in Bangladesh,an external group trig-gers community-wide recognition oftheneed for better sanitation practices.Thecommunity then takes responsibility forself-regulation—motivating households tostrive for complete sanitation.In East andSouth Asia this has even led to innovationsin latrine technology and micro-creditﬁnancing for investments in latrines andassociated infrastructure.Subsidies.The community focus alsochanges the approach to latrine subsidies.InBangladesh,villages in the VERC/WaterAidproject did not require any external subsidy.To assist low-income households,higher-income households provided resources.Once communities focused on the need forcollective responsibility,assisting individualhouseholds to reach community goals wasmore readily accepted.In Vietnam the par-ticipatory approach was supported by a sub-sidy targeted at poorer households.But even ifa subsidy is required,the ﬁs-cal contribution could be delivered to thecommunity,rewarding collective action,self-regulation,and the elimination ofopen defecation.Take one ofIndia’slargest states—Maharashtra state,with 97million people.It subsidized latrine con-struction by households below the povertyline only to discover that close to 45 per-cent ofthe latrines were not being used.So it shifted its subsidy to a competitivescheme (the Gadge Baba scheme) thatrewarded communities for good sanita-tion practices,using an information cam-paign to deﬁne the principles ofsanitationand publicizing the names ofwinning vil-lages.Reputation,recognition,and com-munity rewards became the catalyst.Overa short period an estimated 100,000household latrines were built,and forevery rupee ofstate resources,localspending on sanitation and related infra-structure increased by 35 rupees.Local compacts.Making the shift to bettersanitation practices is the ﬁrst objective—but sustaining the shift is equally impor-tant.The local externalities and the need tounderstand and draw on local conditionsand knowledge suggest that local govern-ments are the appropriate policymaker tier.In Vietnam and West Bengal,India,localgovernments have supported communityparticipation and ensured its continuity byﬁnancing the work ofthe service provider,usually a not-for-proﬁt organization.InVietnam some local governments have useda program similar to Maharashtra state’sGadge Baba scheme to acknowledge villageand individual achievements.Responding to demand in urban areasHouseholds in urban settlements with highpopulation densities often show a greaterdemand for better sanitation facilities.Thecondominial systems in São Paulo,Brazil,and the community sanitation systems ofOrangi in Karachi,Pakistan,and Parivartanin Ahmedabad,India,suggest that informalurban communities may be willing to man-age and pay for efﬁcient systems ofsanitationand waste disposal.Small independent174WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 200419_WDR_Ch09.qxd  8/14/03  10:08 AM  Page 174(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

providers serving households directly,as inDar-es-Salaam,show that urban householdsdo invest in sanitation.So what are theimpediments to expanding these approaches?The answer may lie outside the realm ofwater and sanitation—and in the regulatorydomain ofurban centers.First,the formalrecognition ofinformal communities by gov-ernments and the provision ofsome form oftenure have strongly inﬂuenced communitywillingness to invest in household infrastruc-ture and to work collectively on communityinfrastructure (La Paz in Bolivia,Ahmedabadin India).Research on garbage collection ininformal settlements in Indonesia providesempirical evidence ofthe negative relation-ship between incomplete property rights andcommunity investment in local publicgoods.476It suggests that improving tenuresecurity increases the probability ofgarbagecollection by 32–44 percent.Second,in dense urban areas the munici-pal government’s willingness to allocate somepublic land to sanitation systems has enabledcommunities to develop community facili-ties,contracting them with a third party tomaintain and operate them (Pune in India).Use is restricted to the community through amonthly charge collected by the communityand paid to the operator.Third,municipal laws need to supportﬂexible standards and ensure that communi-ties and households can make arrangementswith independent providers.Laws that per-mit exclusive service provision need to bereplaced by laws that permit differentapproaches and standards.A concluding caveat is,however,neces-sary on the discussion about sanitation.His-torical evidence suggests that demand forwater and sanitation follows a sequencing—water ﬁrst,followed by sanitation and thendemand for waste water treatment.Experi-ence also suggests that this sequencing isinﬂuenced by many factors ofwhich servicedelivery arrangements in the sector is onlyone.In this context,policymakers mustremain realistic and patient about how farthey can catalyze the demand for sanitationthrough external interventions.Unless em-bedded in a demand-responsive approach,throwing subsidies at latrines will not resolvethe challenge ofscaling up sanitation.ElectricityLike water,electricity has urban and ruralcomponents—and issues ofmanaging gridand off-grid systems.In the grid setting,theissues ofseparating the policymaker fromthe provider,charging for services,usingprivate providers,and developing effectiveregulatory systems are similar to water net-work issues (box 9.8).477A key difference isunbundling (rather than decentralizing)services.For electricity in rural settings,theextension ofthe grid network provideslessons for managing non-network systemsin water.And the emerging use ofoff-gridelectricity systems can draw on lessons fromcommunity-managed water in rural set-tings.Grid systems.The experience from LatinAmerica,Eastern Europe,and South Asiasuggests that unbundling the electricitychain into generation,transmission,andDrinking water,sanitation,and electricity175Unlike water and sanitation coverage,electricity coverage has increased signiﬁcantly over thepast decade.But like water and sanitation,electricity faces daunting challenges in South Asiaand Africa and rural areas across most regions in the world.And as in the case of water andsanitation,increased electricity coverage does not automatically imply efﬁcient service deliv-ery.The problems of theft,intermittent supply,shared access—captured broadly under theheading of electricity losses—make wires no different from pipes in the context of creatingaccountability in service delivery.Source:International Energy Agency (2002).BOX 9.8Are pipes and wires different?0255075100WorldDevelopingcountriesMiddle EastEast AsiaLatin AmericaSouth AsiaSub-SaharanAfricaNorth Africa05101520253035NigeriaIndiaTogoKenyaZimbabweCameroonEritreaAlgeriaSudanThe PhilippinesEgyptIndonesiaEthiopiaChinaOECDElectrification rates by regionPercentPercentElectricity losses, selected countries1990200019_WDR_Ch09.qxd  8/14/03  10:09 AM  Page 175(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

distribution components is critical toreforms in the sector—but only ifthe marketis large enough to support multiple electricitygenerators,and hence genuine competi-tion.478Unbundling provides scope for com-petition in the relevant sectors,primarilygeneration.Separating the components alsocreates scope for getting better informationabout the cost structure ofeach part ofthechain.The competition and the informationadd to client power.But transmission and distribution func-tions are monopolies,and without effectiveregulation it may be difﬁcult to ensure theseparation ofpolicymaker and provider,andeven reduce the scope to introduce competi-tion in generation.Unless distribution istransferred to different types ofownership,anational or regional government as a soleowner will not have much incentive to sepa-rate its policymaking responsibilities from theoperations ofthe distribution system.Privatizing distribution is a common pol-icy approach,but decentralizing electricityassets to local governments is not generallyconsidered.Even where local governmentsown distribution systems—as in SouthAfrica—the policy discussion is about con-solidating into regional distribution systems.This is driven by economies ofscale andscope,and perhaps also by policy decisions tocross-subsidize from urban to rural settingsand to keep the cross subsidy in the sector.Interestingly,in Mumbai and Kolkata,India,where electricity is under local governments,electricity provision has long been under pri-vate operation.Even in Delhi—in effect acity-state—power distribution is now pri-vate.Rural grid.The extension ofthe grid intorural areas offer insights for rural water andoff-grid electricity with regard to reestablish-ing the relationship between policymakerand service providers.A model ofruralcooperatives has emerged in the UnitedStates and is being adapted in Bangladeshand the Philippines.A regional or nationalprovider organization contracts with com-munity cooperatives to be village-level dis-tributors.In Bangladesh the Rural ElectricityBoard (REB) supports the village coopera-tives through technical assistance and ﬁscaltransfers for a part ofthe capital costs.Thiswould be similar to using regional water util-ities to support community-managed watersystems.Importantly,the owner ofthe distri-bution is not the policymaker but the clients.Unbundling the national REB into regionalREBs,with some form ofbenchmarking,could support the clients in breaking a possi-ble monopolistic relationship between theREB and the cooperatives.Rural off-grid.Rural provider organiza-tions—or local governments—can also sup-port off-grid systems in villages,in manycases using renewable energy to generatepower.Donors have traditionally advocatedsolar household systems—not unlike thetechnology push in latrines.But today’srenewable systems can support villagewidegrids—similar to villagewide piped water sys-tems—to provide AC electricity for house-hold appliances ofvarious types.Dependingon local conditions the systems can also bewind-powered,solar,tidal,bio-gas,or hybrid,with fossil-fueled generators as backup.Moving the reform agendaforwardIndia is revolting and the Thames stinks.Slogan in London,1857The result: Chadwick and the sanitary revolution in the United Kingdom.479Given the weak voice relationship betweencitizens and politicians in the water,sanita-tion,and electricity sectors,deep institutionalreform often comes from broader stresses inthe economic,political,and institutionalmachinery ofa country.In London pollutionwas such a cause.In Johannesburg the city’sbankruptcy was the impetus.In cities inAfrica and Latin America a core impulse forreform ofurban water and sanitation is thecombination ofsector problems and amacroeconomic crisis.480Society’s view ofeconomic development isalso important.In Australia,Chile,and Peru,growth-driven economic development strat-egy provided the impetus for improving theperformance ofwater and power markets.Sothe possibilities for sector reform seem great-est when there is a conﬂuence ofnatural chal-lenge,ﬁscal crisis,and institutional reform-176WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 200419_WDR_Ch09.qxd  8/14/03  10:09 AM  Page 176(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

mindedness.479Opportunities for reform maywell arrive only by chance,when broaderchanges in turn catalyze sectoral reforms.What are the potential interim measures? Canincremental change be strategic?For urban networks,change will requireseparating the delivery functions from thoseofbenchmarking and regulation.Keepingthe latter with an upper-tier government—central or regional—while dispersing own-ership ofwater and sanitation assets tolower-tier governments and the private sec-tor could create this separation.Withoutownership responsibilities,the upper-tierpolicymaker would have greater incentivesto use ﬁscal instruments,benchmarking,and regulation to promote improvements inservice provision.Such incentives are lessinherent in a model where the regulator,provider,and owner are one and the same.Charging users for services strengthens thisseparation by directly involving clients inthe service chain through the short route ofaccountability.Where the introduction ofprivate sectorparticipation is tempered by politics or otherfactors,strategic change may have to comeﬁrst through changes in ownership and rela-tionships ofaccountability between tiers ofthe public sector.Interestingly,the history ofsome industrialized countries suggests thatlocal ownership can trigger a more crediblepath to private sector participation,especiallyiflocal governments are effective in strength-ening voice.Where local governments exist and waterand sanitation services have been devolved tolocal governments,the challenge ofimprovedservice delivery would lie in making decen-tralization work.Where local governmentsdo not exist,the lever ofdecentralized owner-ship would be lost,but benchmarking andregulation ofthe public sector would remain.But for such a strategy to be effective,charg-ing for water would become even more criti-cal.It would enable providers to achievesome independence in operations,but moreimportantly it would give clients a role in sus-taining the separation and ensuring that theregulation ofpublic providers is effective.Inthis context,introducing private players in afew ofthe utilities would enhance the effec-tiveness ofbenchmarking the publicproviders.Where this broader approach ofmakingservices work for all is not possible,a targetedapproach for serving poor people using smallindependent providers is still an option.Indeed,increasingly independent providersmay,at the margin,emerge as a critical leverfor making services work for poor people.For rural systems—community-managedsystems and self-provision—the challenge isto seek mechanisms for the policymaker tosupport client power,using local govern-ments,regional utilities,and independentproviders.This is similar to the model oftherural electricity cooperatives supported by aprovider organization that provides a techni-cal and ﬁscal hub.Where local governmentsprovide this hub,the voice channel is direct;where utilities are the support mechanism,the voice channel is indirect.Where theseoptions are not possible,the approach—however unsatisfactory—oftargeted com-munity projects remains.For sanitation,the focus is on collectiveaction—to change behavior and mobilizecommunities to invest in community infra-structure.To support this,compacts betweenpolicymakers and NGOs may be moreappropriate.In urban areas,where greaterdemand for sanitation services may exist,policymakers can support client power byallowing independent providers to functionand by supporting tenure in informal settle-ments.A more incremental version would besimilar to that in the rural water sector—witha public provider organization supportingNGO delivery in targeted areas.But ifthe failure ofvoice is why infra-structure services have failed poor people,targeted intervention cannot form the basisofinstitutional reform.Reforming the rela-tionships ofaccountability would remain thepolicy challenge.Drinking water,sanitation,and electricity17719_WDR_Ch09.qxd  8/14/03  10:10 AM  Page 177(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

a ﬁscal and institutional crisis.Johannesburg was not one institutionbut ﬁve,with an overarching MetropolitanCouncil and four primary-level councils.Each could decide its priorities and approveits budget.But responsibilities for key ser-vices were split between the two levels,andthe operating budgets ofthe councils had tobalance only in aggregate.That meant eachcouncil could blissfully spend on theassumption that its shortfalls would be off-set by surpluses in another.The arrangement was a recipe for disas-ter.Each municipality went on a spendingspree,and ambitious infrastructure planswere rolled out without the ﬁnance.Deteri-orating revenues—due to a service-paymentboycott culture left over from anti-apartheid struggles,poverty,and poor creditcontrol—made the situation worse.The

180For Forms ofGovernment let fools contest;What’er is best administer’d is best.Alexander Pope,Essay on Man.For basic services in education,health,andinfrastructure to work for poor people,gov-ernments have to be involved.Whether theyfulﬁll this responsibility by providing,ﬁnancing,regulating,or monitoring ser-vices or providing information about them,the basic functioning ofgovernment shouldunderpin,not undermine,effective services.When governments do not run well,theycannot sustain the institutional arrangementsand accountability relationships that yieldgood services.Looking at all that govern-ments do,the biggest payoffs to service deliv-ery are likely to come from a few key actions:spending wisely and predictably in line withpriorities and coordinated across sectors;managing decentralization to reap the bene-ﬁts ofbeing closer to the client;developingand deploying administrative capacity to takesound decisions at the top and to implementthem well;curtailing corruption;and learn-ing from success and failure.Public sector reforms take time andskillful political navigation.Agreeing ondesirable goals is easy.Managing the tran-sition is hard.When starting capacities arelow,the road to improved performancemay need to be covered in small steps—what this Report calls strategic incremen-talism.Reforming basic incentives thatstrengthen accountability and raise per-formance closer to formal standards is theplace to start.As incentives become betteraligned and internalized and as adminis-trative capacity grows,more advancedreforms can be deployed to supportdeeper institutional change and scalingup.Throughout this process reformsshould be guided by the lessons ofsuccessand failure.Strengthening the foundationsof governmentGovernments are essential to making basicservices work for poor people,but a govern-ment village school does not ensure thatchildren learn,or a maternity clinic thatmothers can give birth safely.Both needtimely budget transfers,reliable electricity,aconnecting road,probity in procurement,and competent public servants.To sustainservices that work,broader structures at thefoundation ofgovernment must also work.Whether providing,ﬁnancing,regulating,or monitoring services,governments focusedon outcomes for poor people muststrengthen the compact relationship betweenpolicymakers and providers along the longroute ofaccountability.486For basic servicesin education,health,and infrastructure,poli-cymakers must deal with multiple compactrelationships with providers across sectors,space,and time (ﬁgure 10.1).Just as anensemble makes great music when it is wellcoordinated and not because it has a few vir-tuoso musicians,strengthening the longroute is easier when the generalbusiness ofgovernment runs well across the entire gamutofgovernment activities,and not just in a fewPublic sector underpinnings ofservice reform10chapterFigure 10.1Strengthening public sector foundations for service delivery requirescoordinating multiple compact relationshipsEducationHealthInfra-structureOtherProvidersVoiceThe statePoliticiansPolicymakersCitizens/clientsClient powerNonpoorPoorCoalitions/inclusionCompacts21_WDR_Ch10.qxd  8/14/03  10:14 AM  Page 180(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Public sector underpinnings ofservice reform181sectors or agencies.The more sound the basicfunctioning ofgovernment,the stronger thefoundations for service reforms.In managing the cross-cutting activitiesofgovernments,the three institutionalstructures likely to inﬂuence service deliv-ery the most are budgets,decentralization,and public administration.These are cru-cial tasks for a government that wants tomake services work for people:makingbudget allocations and implementing them;organizing and monitoring the tiers ofgov-ernment that provide,ﬁnance,regulate,ormonitor services;and managing publicemployees involved in service delivery.Spending wiselyWhen services fail poor people,a good placeto start looking for the underlying problemis almost always how the government spendsmoney.Ifpoliticians and policymakersspend more than they can sustain,servicesdeteriorate.Ifbudgets are misallocated,basicservices remain underfunded and frontlineproviders are handicapped.And iffunds aremisappropriated,service quality,quantity,and access suffer.The budget is the criticallink on the long route ofaccountabilitycon-necting citizens to providers through politi-cians and policymakers.Public expenditure management—for-mulating,implementing,and reportingannual budgets—is a challenging task,par-ticularly when capacities are limited and thelong route ofaccountability is weak.Chap-ter 5 discusses how citizen budget initiativescan increase voice.This chapter discusseshow politicians and policymakers canstrengthen the compact using public expen-diture management to systematicallyachieve three desirable outcomes that canunderpin effective services:aggregate ﬁscaldiscipline,allocative efﬁciency and equity,and operational impact.487Aggregate ﬁscal disciplineWith no effective mechanism for resolvingthe competing budget claims ofpoliticians,line ministries,and subnational govern-ments,public expenditures will exceedavailable funds.The resulting unsustainableﬁscal deﬁcits can translate into high inﬂa-tion,high interest rates,and burgeoningcurrent account deﬁcits.Despite the simplelogic ofthis argument—and sometimesdriven by external shocks—countries slipinto macroeconomic crises that inevitablylead to belt-tightening.Countries in crisismay have no option but to curtail basic ser-vices,even ifthe service delivery chain nor-mally works well.Argentina is just the mostrecent example (box 10.1).Countries can instill ﬁscal discipline bystrengthening budget formulation by theﬁnance ministry.Constitutional or legisla-tive restraints can rein in legislatures andministries.Brazil and Chile have laws on ﬁs-cal responsibility that limit budget deﬁcits.In Colombia,Peru,the Philippines,andUruguay the constitution constrains or pro-hibits amendments to increase budgets.Sound public expenditure managementrequires reliable revenue projections andcomprehensive budgets that do not hideguarantees and other contingent liabilities.When budgets are not comprehensive,theconsequences can be harsh,as Thailandfound in 1997 when contingent liabilitiesfrom the banking and ﬁnance sectors blind-sided the government and triggered aregionwide ﬁnancial crisis.Allocative efﬁciency and equityFor basic services in education,health,andinfrastructure to work for poor people,gov-ernments have to be involved,as chapter 2After three years of recession,the economicand ﬁnancial crisis in Argentina came to ahead at the end of 2001.The social impact ofthe crisis has been devastating.Poverty rateshave jumped 40 percent.There is growingevidence of deterioration in service quality,access,and use of social services.Roughly 12percent of people with formal health insur-ance discontinued or reduced their cover-age,increasing the burden on alreadystrapped public hospitals,the traditionalprovider for the uninsured.Difﬁculties withfederal transfers have led to serious short-ages in medical supplies throughout thepublic hospital network.The pressure formaintaining funding for high-cost curativecare has further cut into the already lowresources allocated to primary care.Mater-nal and child health is likely to be at risk.Epi-demiological surveillance data report anincrease in some endemic diseases.Education has been similarly hit,withsalary delays and work stoppages in severalprovinces.During 2002 roughly a third ofprovinces experienced school closings of20–80 days over a school year of 180 days.Many provinces were forced to concentratetheir falling resources on wages,sharplyreducing ﬁnancing for school lunches,infra-structure,and other investments.Source:World Bank staff.BOX 10.1The impact ofArgentina’s crisis on health andeducation services21_WDR_Ch10.qxd  8/14/03  10:14 AM  Page 181(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

makes clear.This requires sound budgeting.Good,results-oriented budget allocationsare both an outcome ofthe long route ofaccountability and a source ofits strength,particularly for the link between policy-makers and providers.How should govern-ments allocate budgets to improve educa-tion and health outcomes?

Inconsidering these issues,politicians andpolicymakers need to pay particular atten-tion to what is known about the multisec-toral determinants ofhealth and educationoutcomes in their country (see crate 1.1).Reducing infant mortality may have asmuch to do with how the water ministry(clean water) or the education ministry(female literacy) gets and uses its budget aswith how the health ministry does.There are many pitfalls in consideringthe rationale and instruments for govern-ment interventions.Focusing on marketfailures alone (information asymmetry,missing insurance markets) presumes thatgovernment implementation failures areinconsequential.Where this is actuallytrue,public provision or ﬁnancing isappropriate (table 10.1).But where govern-ment failures outweigh market failures,ignoring them can lead to large publicexpenditures that beneﬁt only the non-poor or to services so defective that theiropportunity costs outweigh their beneﬁtsfor most poor people.In difﬁcult-to-moni-tor clinical care,ifprimary rural healthclinics lack professional staffand medicinesand the political environment is not pro-poor,public provision or even subsidies forprivate provision may not work for poorpeople.Better alternatives might be fund-ing demand-side health subsidies or dis-trict hospitals where monitoring is easierand peer pressure for doctors can work.Where monitoring is easy,as in immuniza-tion campaigns,contracting for privateprovision may be a good solution.Similarly,ignoring the likely privateresponse to public interventions (such asthe crowding out ofprivate providers orhousehold income effects ofgovernmentsubsidies) can lead to ineffective publicexpenditures.Equity-seeking public expen-ditures can end up helping the non-poor ifanalysis suggesting that services or moneynever reach poor people is ignored in policydesign.These questions about rationale andinstruments cannot be answered withoutdetailed information about the sector,theservice,the nature and depth ofmarket andgovernment failures,who beneﬁts (expen-diture incidence),and private responses topublic interventions.This informationneeds to be developed through in-depth182WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Table 10.1Fallible markets, fallible governments, or both?Government failureHighLowHighAmbiguous, hard-to-monitor situations in which government failure Market failures keep services from beneﬁting poor people.

Public sector underpinnings ofservice reform183analytical work (in itselfa public good thatgovernments and their external partnersshould fund).Determining true costs andimpacts for allocation decisions is not easy,particularly when self-serving line agencieshave strong incentives to manipulate orwithhold information from the ministry ofﬁnance.This information asymmetry canlead to perverse practices (such as line min-istries back-loading costs to later years) thatreduce the transparency ofthe budget andits alignment with overall priorities and thepracticalities ofwhat works.In recent years several countries haveapproached these problems oftransparencyand results orientation in budget formula-tion through medium-term expenditureframeworks.These multiyear frameworksmake tradeoffs more transparent across sec-tors and time and synchronize medium-term priority setting with the annual bud-get cycle.They offer the promise ofbetterbudget management,though early imple-mentation suggests that realizing thesegains takes quite a bit oftime,effort,andparallel improvements in budget executionand reporting.488Properly implemented,a medium-termexpenditure framework can reduce incen-tives for bureaucratic gaming and revealthe true costs ofthe political choices beingmade in the budget.It can usefully addressthe information asymmetry between theministry ofﬁnance and line agencies,because its forward-estimate systemrequires line ministries to cost their pro-grams over the medium term—essentiallya rolling three- or four-year budget.Aproperly functioning forward-estimatesystem can induce line agencies to setaside funding for recurrent costs andimprove the delivery ofservices sufferingfrom inadequate maintenance,such asprimary schools.As the capacity to manage grows,amedium-term expenditure framework canoffer other advantages.Sector-speciﬁcexpenditure frameworks can be developedand linked to the overall framework,increasing conﬁdence that the budget isbecoming more results-oriented (chapter 8discusses this approach to health budgetingin Mali).With a multiyear framework poli-cymakers can focus on new programs,sinceallocations for existing programs,decidedin previous years,would only need updat-ing.Finance ministries can more transpar-ently require line ministries to propose cutsin ongoing activities to pay for new pro-grams.Line ministries would have anincentive to know the least effective pro-grams at any point in time,creatingdemand for systematic monitoring andimpact assessment capacity and for clientfeedback.For all their advantages however,medium-term expenditure frameworks arenot a magic bullet.Aggregate and sectoraloutcomes and capacity development reveala mixed picture.Some applications arematuring slowly (in Albania,South Africa,Uganda),some are still coming together(Rwanda,Tanzania),and some are strug-gling (Bolivia,Burkina Faso,Cameroon,Ghana,Malawi).489In Malawi’s develop-ment budget for 1996–97,health was allo-cated at 21 percent ofthe total but itreceived only 4 percent.490Implementingmedium-term expenditure frameworks isdifﬁcult,perhaps taking a dozen years ormore,as the experience ofearly adopterssuch as Uganda demonstrates.A solid foun-dation ofbudget execution and reportingseems key,but is also difﬁcult to achieve.Implementing a medium-term expenditureframework can help build the basics,as canparticipatory budgeting initiatives dis-cussed in chapter 5.Other success factorsinclude carefully matching implementationto capacity,keeping budget projections andestimates realistic,distinguishing betweencollective ministerial responsibility in thecabinet and the interests ofindividual min-istries,and engaging line ministries in thestrategic phase prior to considering detailedestimates,when the rationale and instru-ments for public intervention can be care-fully thought through.Operational impactUltimately,even the best budget allocationsare only as good as their impact on desiredoutcomes for poor people.After controllingfor national income,comparative studiesshow that public spending per capita andoutcomes are only weakly associated21_WDR_Ch10.qxd  8/14/03  10:15 AM  Page 183(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

(chapter 2).Similar changes in spending areassociated with different changes in out-comes,and different changes in spendingare associated with similar changes in out-comes.This is not to suggest that publicfunding cannot be successful—countrieslike Thailand have sharply reduced infantmortality rates through commitment,goodpolicies,and spending.But it does meanthat unless public expenditures are results-oriented they will be ineffective.There hasbeen a major push in recent years to makepolicymakers and providers accountablenot only for how they spend money but alsofor what they achieve—for intermediateoutputs and ﬁnal outcomes.Countries areusing several instruments:single-sector andmultisector program approaches,align-ment ofoverall national strategies withbudgets,tools for verifying where themoney goes,and stronger oversight con-trols to reduce fraud and misuse ofpublicfunds.Programmatic approaches.Individual in-vestment projects can fall short oftheirobjectives ifthey ignore linkages or trade-offs over time and space or with other sec-tors.Chapter 11 discusses sectorwideapproaches as a way ofenhancing develop-ment impact,building stronger donor part-nerships,improving the management ofsector resources,and scaling up successes.Used in countries as diverse as Bangladesh,Bolivia,Brazil,Burkina Faso,Ethiopia,Ghana,Mali,Mozambique,Pakistan,Tan-zania,and Zambia,sectorwide approachesshow that over time strategies and objec-tives are better articulated,and manage-ment information,monitoring,evaluation,and resource planning systems better estab-lished,in sectors that use such approachesthan in those that do not.Poverty reduction strategies.A country’spoverty reduction strategy can link publicexpenditures explicitly to service deliveryfor the poor,build country ownership,andstrengthen citizen voice through consulta-tions with civil society.In 1999 low-incomecountries began preparing Poverty Reduc-tion Strategy Papers(PRSPs) as the basis forconcessional lending from the World Bankand the International Monetary Fund andfor debt reliefunder the enhanced HeavilyIndebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Ini-tiative.491Many countries and donors havestressed better public expenditure manage-ment as a means oftracking pro-poorspending and increasing donor and recipi-ent accountability for external assistance.Arecent review ofthe pro-poor expendituretracking capacities ofbudget managementsystems among HIPCs suggests that theyhave far to go.492While recognizing thatimprovements in public expenditure man-agement will take time,493both domesticstakeholders and donors have highlightedthe need for developing and implementingdetailed plans for improvement.Ideally,poverty strategies should be fullyintegrated into the budget,but this is still anew approach and success has varied.Forsome countries integration has been a pri-mary goal (Albania).Tanzania and Ugandahave integrated poverty strategies with theirmedium-term expenditure frameworks,adding focus,legitimacy,and stability toboth.But other countries have assignedresponsibility for preparing their povertystrategy to a ministry not directly con-cerned with public expenditure planning.In Ghana,it was initially assigned to theplanning ministry,though more recentlythe planning portfolio has been folded intothe ﬁnance minister’s portfolio.Public expenditure tracking surveys.Injudging operational impact—the qualityand quantity ofservice delivery,and where,how,and to what effect allocated funds arespent—public expenditure tracking sur-veys can follow the ﬂow offunds throughtiers ofgovernment to determine whetherthe funds actually reach the schools or clin-ics they are destined for.Tracking surveysnot only highlight the uses and abuses ofpublic funds,but also give insights intocapture,cost efﬁciency,decentralization,and accountability.494Even when littleﬁnancial information is available,trackingsurveys can show what money is supposedto reach a community and how much actu-ally does.Made public,this informationcan strengthen voice and client power rela-tionships (box 10.2).184WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 200421_WDR_Ch10.qxd  8/14/03  10:16 AM  Page 184(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Public sector underpinnings ofservice reform185Financial management.Auditing helps agovernment hold itselfaccountable for theway policymakers and providers spendmoney.Audits have traditionally focused onbasic ﬁnancial controls and cash ﬂows.Thisfocus reﬂects the control culture in publicﬁnance and the long-established view thataccountability for fund use supports the dis-ciplined use ofresources as intended by bud-gets.In recent years,however,accounting andauditing processes have been challenged toexamine expenditure performance as well asconformance.The new performance orienta-tion ofaudits is particularly relevant to oper-ational efﬁciency concerns in budgets andsuggests an expanded notion ofaccountabil-ity.Public ﬁnancial managers now need toconsider their roles as contributors to ﬁnaloutcomes as well as controllers.495Procurement.The cost and quality ofgov-ernment programs are critically affected by theprocurement process through which budgetsare spent.Procurement inevitably encom-passes an intricate set ofrules and procedures,each capable ofretarding or promoting trans-parency,contestability,accountability,and efﬁ-ciency.Leakages,primarily through fraud andcorruption,can mean substandard equipmentand infrastructure,lack ofessential medicalsupplies,insufﬁcient textbooks,unnecessarylow-priority goods,and poor-quality publicservices.Inefﬁcient procedures create highercosts for suppliers,which are passed throughas higher program costs.Improving procure-ment requires extensive analysis ofits rules,procedures,and institutional arrangements.To support streamlining,several countrieshave turned to information and communica-tions technology.Brazil,Chile,Mexico,thePhilippines,and the Republic ofKorea,amongothers,have developed strong e-procurementsystems that lower costs and increase trans-parency,competition,and efﬁciency.496Decentralizing to improve servicesIn countries big and small central govern-ments are transferring responsibilities tolower tiers ofgovernment,motivated in partby the desire to bring politicians and policy-makers closer to clients and to make servicesmore effective.The world’s two largest coun-tries,China and India,have embraced decen-tralization.China’s phenomenal industrialgrowth took place within an institutionalframework ofdecentralization,and India’sconstitution was amended in 1992 to pro-mote local government.497But the extent ofdecentralization varies considerably and isprobably less than generally imagined:evenin developed countries the average subna-tional share ofexpenditures was just above 30percent in recent years (ﬁgure 10.2).Subnational authorities can be efﬁcientproviders and regulators oflocal servicesunder the right institutional incentives andwith clarity about who does what—and withwhat.498But greater autonomy can alsoincrease opportunistic behavior and createmoral hazard,resulting in costs that diminishaccountability and the beneﬁts ofdecentral-ization.499Good design,sound management,and constant adaptation by both central andsubnational authorities are needed to makedecentralization work.In the early 1990s the Ugandan governmentdramatically increased spending on primaryeducation.But school enrollments stagnated.Could it be that the money was not reachingschools? To answer this question,a publicexpenditure tracking survey started collect-ing data in 1996 on government transfers toschools.It found that 87 percent of the non-wage resources intended for the schools wasdiverted to other uses.This information wasmade public and prompted a vigorousresponse from the national government,which,along with parents,put pressure onschool principals to plug the leaks (see spot-light on Uganda).Follow-up studies haveshown that the situation has improved.Tracking surveys can ﬁnd problems inunexpected places.A survey in Peru track-ing a participatory food supplementprogram (Vaso de Leche,or “Glass of Milk”)revealed that less than a third of each dollartransferred from the central governmentreached intended beneﬁciaries.Most of theleakage occurred below the municipallevel—in the Mothers Committees andhouseholds.The results challenged thebelief underlying the program that localcommunity organizations were alwaysmore accountable than public agencies.Authorities have decided to merge all nutri-tion programs into a social fund that willtransform Vaso de Leche into a conditional,multipurpose,cash-transfer program withstronger accountability.These and other tracking surveys inChad,Ghana,Honduras,Mozambique,Papua New Guinea,Rwanda,Senegal,Tanza-nia,and Zambia suggest several lessons.They conﬁrm that budget execution is amajor problem and show that proceduralclarity and due process are often missing.They ﬁnd that poor resource managementis often a result of too much discretion inresource allocation when there is limitedinformation,weak controls,and strongvested interests.Tracking surveys revealinsights into the actual (rather than the for-mal) operation of schools and health clinicsand allow comparisons of public,private,and nongovernmental providers.Trackingsurveys are highly cost-effective if the leaksthey detect are plugged.But they need anauthorizing environment:unless there is asolid political commitment for more trans-parency,government agencies may bereluctant to open their books.The challengeis to institutionalize tracking surveys withina country’s own ﬁnancial control regime.Source:World Bank staff.BOX 10.2The case ofthe missing money: publicexpenditure tracking surveys 21_WDR_Ch10.qxd  8/14/03  10:16 AM  Page 185(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Decentralization and service deliveryDecentralization is not magic.Allocatingmore responsibilities to subnational gov-ernments does not itselftransform servicedelivery.This depends on whether decen-tralization is motivated by political,ﬁscal,or service reform objectives.Decentralization is often primarily apolitical act aimed at greater regionalautonomy.Decentralization ofservices is aby-product (box 10.3).Indonesia decentral-ized responsibility for many services in1999–2000,including schooling,as part ofalarger move to greater regional autonomy.In such cases decentralization is a fact oflifeeducators must cope with—not a deliberateeducational reform.New arrangements canalways create opportunities for reform,however.Using those opportunities effec-tively depends on two conditions.First,there must be relevant information aboutperformance across jurisdictions so that cit-izens can bring justiﬁed pressure to bear onpoliticians and policymakers iftheir area islagging.Second,there must be an environ-ment in which local jurisdictions can exper-iment and evaluate new approaches.Decentralization may also be driven byﬁscal concerns to align responsibility forservices with the level ofgovernment bestable to manage and mobilize resources forthem.One danger is that the central gov-ernment uses this as an excuse to off-loadexpenditure responsibilities onto jurisdic-tions that cannot have recourse to poten-tially inﬂationary ﬁnancing.While thiscould lead to a greater willingness to paymore local taxes (because citizens perceive adirect link between taxes and service qual-ity),there is no reason to believe that this isautomatic.Fiscally motivated decentraliza-tion is particularly worrisome where specialequalization efforts for lagging regions orsafety nets for poor families must be sus-tained by the center.Decentralization can also be driven by adesire to move services administrativelycloser to the people.But success depends onhow decentralization affects relationshipsofaccountability.Ifdecentralization justreplaces the functions ofthe central min-istry with a slightly lower tier ofgovern-ment (a province or state),but everything186WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 200401020304050607080LocalState or provincialSouth AfricaSwitzerlandAustraliaUnited StatesBrazilGermanySpainBoliviaAustriaMalaysiaNetherlands AntillesDenmarkRussian FederationFinlandBelarusMongoliaSwedenNorwayIcelandUnited KingdomItalyNetherlandsLatviaHungaryPolandLithuaniaCzech RepublicBulgariaAlbaniaFranceLuxembourgIsraelCroatiaBelgiumRomaniaThailandPortugalBotswanaKenyaMauritiusTrinidad and TobagoNicaraguaCosta RicaPanamaIndiaArgentinaIndonesiaPeru020Percent4060South Asia (1)High Income,OECD (18)Europe and CentralAsia (13)Latin American and theCaribbean (9)East Asia and thePacific (4)Sub-Saharan Africa (4)PercentBy country, latest available yearBy region, latest available yearNote: Simple averages of most recent observations for countrieswith available data.

Public sector underpinnings ofservice reform187else about service delivery remains thesame,there is little reason to expect positivechange.The assumption is that decentral-ization works by enhancing citizens’voicein a way that leads to improved services.Buton both theoretical and empirical groundsthis could go either way.The crucial ques-tion always is whether decentralizationincreases accountability relative to its alter-natives.Iflocal governments are no morevulnerable to capture than the center is,decentralization is likely to improve bothefﬁciency and equity.500The impact ofdecentralization on ser-vices is further complicated when,as is usu-ally the case,political,ﬁscal,and administra-tive goals are not followed simultaneously orin a supportive sequence.Decentralizationin eight Latin American countries suggeststhat political objectives were often the trig-ger,but paths diverged thereafter (box 10.4).Only some countries moved on to ﬁscal andadministrative decentralization as primaryobjectives.Such variation,inevitable ascountries adapt,makes it hard to predict thecourse ofdecentralization and to measureits costs and beneﬁts.501Given its manypaths,the record ofservice improvements ismixed—including some notable successes(decentralizing education in Central Amer-ica,devolution in Bolivia,municipalreforms in South Africa),some reversals (inthe Russian Federation and parts ofLatinAmerica),and some cases too new to assess(initiatives in Indonesia and Pakistan).502Decentralization and accountability for servicesDecentralization must reach the clinic,theclassroom,and local water and electricity util-ities in ways that create opportunities forstrengthening accountability between citi-zens,politicians/policymakers,and providers.Depending on its degree—deconcentration,delegation,and devolution—and its imple-mentation,decentralization offers opportuni-ties for strengthening different parts oftheDecentralization in Latin America shows how objec-tives changed over time in each country and shapedoutcomes and the path of decentralization.Wheredecentralization was driven mainly by politicalobjectives (as in Ecuador,Peru,and Venezuela),thetransfer of resources was often signiﬁcant,but thetransfer of responsibilities was more difﬁcult to pur-sue.Where political decentralization was joined anddriven by sophisticated but misaligned regional ﬁs-cal autonomy (as in Argentina and Brazil),cyclicaleconomic and political crises erupted because of theinability of the center to impose ﬁscal discipline onsubnational governments.In Colombia,thoughdecentralization was initially driven by politicalmotives,ﬁscal and administrative adjustments randeeper,and cyclical adjustments in the ﬁscal andadministrative systems were common.This experience in Latin America shows that thetransfer of political,ﬁscal,and administrative powerdoes not necessarily occur simultaneously or in asupportive sequence.In fact,only in Bolivia’s reformeffort in 1994 were these powers transferredtogether.Chile democratized in 1990,introducedpopular participation but not regional elections anddevolution,and in the mid-1990s further deepenedthe administrative delegation that had marked itsearlier military regime.Of these countries Chile maynow be best placed to attempt deeper administra-tive and political devolution because of the growthof local capacity and the absence of the regional ﬁs-cal crises that struck many of its neighbors on theirroad to decentralization.Source:Frank,Starnfeld,and Zimmerman (2003).BOX 10.4Many roads to decentralization: Latin AmericaIn Ethiopia decentralization has been aresponse to pressures from regional and eth-nic groups for greater political participation.When the Ethiopian People’s RevolutionaryDemocratic Front (EPRDF) defeated theMengistu dictatorship in 1991,the new gov-ernment faced a complex political landscape.Ethnicity was extremely politicized,and thestruggle against Mengistu had been spear-headed by organizations promoting ethnicnationalism in Ethiopia’s diverse population.The single-party EPRDF government neededto establish control over the entire country,legitimize its authority,and include othergroups in the political system.The 1994 constitution transformedEthiopia into an ethnicity-based federationand decentralized administrative responsi-bilities to nine regions.The accompanyingeducation reforms were laid out in the “Edu-cation and Training Policy of 1994.”Regionswere given responsibility for planning,designing,implementing,and monitoringthe primary education curriculum andteacher training.The syllabus remained cen-trally controlled,with input from theregions.Previously,Amharic had been thesole language of instruction,but the newpolicy gave all children the right to receiveprimary education in their mother tongue.At least 18 languages are now being usedas the medium of instruction,althoughAmharic remains the national language.Politically motivated decentralizationcarries implications that are critical for theimpact of reform.The education policiesadopted along with political decentraliza-tion may well be good ideas for improvingthe quality of instruction and learning.But ifimproving quality is not a central objectiveof decentralizing Ethiopian education,theresulting lack of commitment to ensuringthat outcome could become the most difﬁ-cult obstacle to overcome.Source:Pritchett and Farooqui (2003).BOX 10.3Decentralization as a

Public sector underpinnings ofservice reform189devolved to the lowest tier ofgovernmentthat can internalize the costs and beneﬁts ofthe service—the so-called subsidiarity princi-ple.The principle suggests that subnationalgovernments should administer basic healthand education services.But setting minimumstandards (for quantity,quality,and access)and ﬁnancing minimum access should becentral responsibilities on grounds ofinter-jurisdictional equity.In practice,things getmore complicated.Expenditures are oftennot assigned carefully to subnational govern-ments.506Central governments delay trans-fers.Shared expenditure responsibilities arethe trickiest to handle and can lead to free-rider problems and deﬁcit- and cost-shiftingbehavior that softens the budget constraint.To increase responsiveness to local citi-zens,subnational governments need a localtax instrument and the freedom to set rates.Also important are simple,transparent,for-mula-based transfers from the center thatare predictable over several years.Ifmadecontingent on service outputs,lump-sumgrants can ensure a minimum level ofser-vice delivery for poor people,equalize ﬁscalcapacity across jurisdictions,and create per-formance incentives.Ideally,expenditures,revenue assignments,and transfers shouldbe designed jointly so that once they are set,any additional expenditure demands couldbe met through taxes rather than grants.507The more these principles are violated,thegreater the informality around transfers,and the lower their predictability and stabil-ity,the softer the budget constraint gets.508Getting subnational borrowing right.Cap-ital markets,where sufﬁciently developed,can bolster subnational accountability.Table 10.2Decentralization is never simpleKey political, ﬁscal, and administrative features of decentralization and the accountability for service deliveryDegree of decentralizationPolitical featuresFiscal featuresAdministrative featuresDeconcentration • No elected local government• Local government is a service delivery arm• Provider staff working at local level are (minimal change)• Local leadership vested in local ofﬁcials, of the center and has little or no discretion employees of center, and accountable to such as a governor or mayor, but appointed over how or where services are providedcenter, usually through their ministries;

Where markets are underdeveloped and mar-ket discipline is weak,a prior question iswhether subnational governments shouldborrow at all.Effective ﬁscal decentralizationshould certainly precede ﬁnancial decentral-ization to avoid giving the signal that the cen-ter is underwriting subnational debts.509Allowing subnational borrowing from publicﬁnancial institutions can unintentionally sendthis signal.In Argentina,Brazil,India,andUkraine,specialized development banks andinstitutions have provided a backdoor routeto central subsidies when transfers wouldhave been simpler and more transparent.Getting subnational regulation right.Governments ﬁnd it hard not to bail outlower-tier governments when ﬁnancialproﬂigacy threatens basic services,risksspreading to other jurisdictions,or threat-ens monetary policy or the country’s creditrating.This has led to the imposition oftop-down regulation,either administrativecontrols or rule-based debt restrictions thatmimic the market.Regulation,because it isvulnerable to political bargaining,usuallyneeds to be supplemented by checks andbalances on the center itselfso that itsstance remains credible.In South Africathese are provided by the constitution,theconstitutional court,and international cap-ital markets.510Subnational bankruptcyarrangements can help.A control board(that can be invoked only by an indepen-dent court) to ﬁnance minimum,nationallyset service levels can protect the center fromhaving to step in.Where bailouts areunavoidable,the center can use the oppor-tunity to make regulation more effective.Acomprehensive ﬁscal monitoring and evalu-ation system that works consistently acrossjurisdictions can help greatly in implement-ing no-bailout and regulation strategies.Getting administrativeresponsibilities rightPolitical and ﬁscal considerations gener-ally claim far greater attention thanadministrative decentralization does.511Inmany instances decentralization has pro-ceeded without explicit stafﬁng strategies,and a central civil service typically coexistswith subnational and local governments.Though the 1992 landmark amendmentsto the Indian constitution require eachstate to create urban and rural local gov-ernments and assign functions and rev-enues,virtually all staffat the local levelremain state employees.In contrast,Indonesia recently adopted a “big-bang”approach,moving quickly to transferroughly 2.1 million civil servants to sub-national district governments.512Uganda,in shifting from deconcentration to devo-lution in the 1990s,established districtservice commissions with the authority tohire and ﬁre personnel—though in prac-tice central policy and administrativerules have tightly controlled the process sothat it has resembled delegation morethan devolution.That may change as localcapacities grow.Pakistan’s recent three-tier devolution envisages the creation ofdistrict and subdistrict cadres:districthealth and education cadres have beencreated in some provinces,but adminis-trative decentralization still has a long wayto go.National pay scales,rigid collective bar-gaining agreements,and disagreements withnational labor unions can severely circum-scribe the ﬂexibility that subnational gov-ernments have in rationalizing employment,as seen in many Asian,African,and LatinAmerican countries.513Centralized labornegotiations and bargaining agreements canact as unfunded mandates that undo ﬁscaldecentralization (as in South Africa).Engag-ing public sector workers and unions in dis-cussions about different aspects ofdecen-tralization can increase local ﬂexibility andimprove provider compacts.At the sametime,administrative devolution needs tostrike a balance between autonomy and uni-formity to allow for desirable features suchas interjurisdictional mobility for highlyskilled staffin short supply.It is importantto align the structure ofthe civil service withthe assignment ofservice responsibilities todifferent tiers—misalignment confusesincentives,weakens accountability,and cre-ates conﬂicts ofinterest instead ofchecksand balances.In practice this is not easy,andit takes time.The twin tasks ofdevolving administra-tion and building local capacity can be190WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 200421_WDR_Ch10.qxd  8/14/03  10:18 AM  Page 190(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Public sector underpinnings ofservice reform191daunting even under ideal conditions ofbudget and stakeholder support.Whenbudgets are constrained and support ismixed,public administration reform isinevitably drawn out,falling behind politi-cal and ﬁscal decentralization.So the earlierthe start in building local capacities,thesmoother the process ofdecentralization islikely to be.Building local capacity withautonomyDecentralize or build local capacity:whichﬁrst? In an ideal world subnational govern-ments would be made fully accountablebefore they were given authority and auton-omy.Decentralization in the absence ofade-quate local capacity was once consideredundesirable,514but that view is changing asexperience shows that local capacitiesexpand best as decentralized systems mature,even though sequencing remains difﬁcult.The challenge is to balance political,ﬁscal,and administrative considerations evenwhen capacity mismatches occur.Wherelocal institutions already exist,even informalones,the challenge is to deﬁne their respon-sibilities and legal status and move the infor-mal closer to the formal.Where local institu-tions do not exist,the challenge is toconstruct the underlying legal and politicalframework for new institutions.Fostering capacity is best done in part-nership between the center and subnationalgovernments,with the center providingincentives for subnational governments tomatch demand-driven capacity growthwith supply-side assistance and ﬁnancing(box 10.5).In this partnership the functionsofcentral staffalso change,from line man-agement to policy formulation,technicaladvice,and monitoring.Central staffrequire incentives and training to do theirnew jobs effectively.Pulling the pieces togetherDecentralization fails or succeeds in theinterplay ofits ﬁscal,administrative,andlocal capacity attributes.The center’s role iscrucial for all three elements and,morebroadly,for the design and implementationofdecentralization.When there is a softbudget constraint and the relationships ofvoice and client power are weak,subna-tional governments will have little incentiveto develop local capacity and perform well,which will make local capture by elitesmore likely.Ultimately,the center is bothregulator and facilitator ofdecentraliza-tion.Its challenge is to balance these rolesas it makes and manages the policy frame-work for the public sector and for servicedelivery.Making,managing,and implementing good policiesWhen the policy decisions ofpoliticians andpolicymakers at the center ofgovernment—senior decisionmakers and veto holders inthe executive,council ofministers,or cabi-net—are uncoordinated,inconsistent,orbadly implemented,the long route ofaccountability and service delivery are likelyto suffer.Breakdowns in policy managementcan include a range offailures (box 10.6).Sure signs ofbreakdown? When political pol-icy decisions are not implemented,partiallyimplemented,or reversed.515A study oftwoAfrican nations revealed that more than Devolution is difﬁcult when subnational gov-ernments lack skills and institutional capac-ity.The central government can providetraining in top-down ways.Or it can createan enabling environment,using its ﬁnanceand regulatory powers to help subnationalgovernments deﬁne their needs (making theprocess demand-driven),to deploy trainingfrom many sources (local or national privatesector),to learn by doing as decentralizationproceeds,and to establish learning networksamong jurisdictions.This second approach ismore consistent with devolution and morelikely to produce capacity tailored to themany cross-sector responsibilities of subna-tional governments.It also avoids the pitfallsof a supply-driven approach.The center may need to provide capac-ity support,throughboth a demand-drivengrant facility (for example,to helpsubnational governments contract localand other expertise) and a supply window(for example,mobile teams with ﬁnancialmanagement,technical,and communitymobilization skills).Fiscalsupport throughblock grants or challenge funds can workon a competitive or matching basis to sup-port local governments that achieve perfor-mance benchmarks (implementing a bud-geting system,attaining service targets).Monitoring and evaluation capacitycanalso be facilitated by performance-basedincentive grants.Monitoring efforts shouldfeed into stronger public communicationand outreach efforts so that subnationalgovernments can beneﬁt from better clientfeedback.Successful capacity building requires aphased strategy,starting with the stabiliza-tionof core responsibilities.Next comes atransformation phase with restructuringplans based on a critical examination of ser-vice responsibilities and priorities,institu-tional arrangements,and ﬁnancial andhuman resources.Finally,a consolidationphase seeks to internalize capacity growthbased on constant learning by doing andadaptation.This is inevitably a drawn-outprocess marked by the constant need tobalance greater autonomy and capacity.Source:World Bank staff.BOX 10.5Building local capacity: the role ofthe center21_WDR_Ch10.qxd  8/14/03  10:19 AM  Page 191(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

two-thirds ofcabinet decisions were neverimplemented.516In Zambia genuine supportfor reforms introduced by the multipartydemocratic government in the early 1990snever extended beyond a few cabinet minis-ters.As a result,special interest groups,whohad not been consulted,slowed implementa-tion to a crawl.517Such missteps are possibleat each stage ofthe policy managementprocess (ﬁgure 10.4).Getting good policies in education,health,and infrastructurePolicy management is particularly difﬁcultin health,education,and infrastructurebecause outcomes such as reduced infantmortality have multiple determinants thatcross sectors and jurisdictions (see crate1.1);costs come early and impacts muchlater;and the spillover effects ofservices arestrong.Policy management in these sectorsis often an outcome ofwell-informed bar-gaining between competing domestic inter-ests,so accounting for domestic politicalconcerns is important.By contrast,macro-economic management tends to be the pre-serve ofa few relatively insulated tech-nocrats,with the central bank and ﬁnanceministry as key veto players,crises having tobe dealt with expeditiously,and domesticpolitical concerns often not included indecisionmaking.518How a cabinet secretariat or presidentialstaffthat links politicians with policymak-ers plays its role can be crucial to the efﬁ-cacy ofpolicy management in these sectors.Members ofthese staffs,which ofteninclude elite advisory groups that providehigh-quality policy advice,can be vital gate-keepers.They can use contestability—or thecareful evaluation ofalternatives—tosharpen policy advice.In Thailand theNational Economic and Social Develop-ment Board in the prime minister’s ofﬁceprovides independent ﬁscal analysis ofsocial sector initiatives and has promoted acoordinated and participatory institutionalresponse to Thailand’s HIV/AIDS crisis.Cabinet committees,consisting ofsubsetsofministers,their representatives,policy-makers,and sometimes outside experts,canbe particularly effective for intersectoralcoordination and implementation and foridentifying contending views and resolvingthem before the formal decision process.Research on cabinet functioning suggeststhe conditions that favor high-quality policymanagement in dealing with complex multi-192WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Breakdowns in policy management cover awide spectrum:•Failure to set major policy priorities,tounderstand tradeoffs and make toughchoices between conﬂicting objectives,or to translate priorities into concreteoperational decisions,most typicallythrough the budget process.•A policy vacuum,because of governmentdiscontinuity or weak or poorlyarticulated policies.•Lack of trust between politicians and pol-icymakers,leading to frequent end runsaround formal decision structures.•Unclear organizational roles or conﬂict-ing agendas among line ministries,com-bined with a failure to consult allministries with a stake in a particulardecision.•Failure to consult external stakeholders,anticipate opposition,and build electoralsupport through the relationship ofvoice.•Poorly drafted and inadequately costedsubmissions (particularly ignoring down-stream expenditures),and proposals notvetted thoroughly for their legality andconsistency with previous policies.•Parallel groups,often invisible and unac-countable,inﬂuencing policy from out-side formal government.Source:Beschel and Manning (2000).BOX 10.6“Yes,Minister”Figure 10.4The anatomy of policy mismanagement at the topCommon veto/delaypoint for externalactorsPoliticians makeunrealistic, unaffordablepolicy commitments1Departments prepareuncoordinatedor poorly costedpolicies2Politicians fail toprovide adequatebudgets3Departments implement poor-qualityor unauthorizedinitiatives4Weak compact andconfused providersPolicy mismanagement by politiciansPolicy mismanagement by policymakersSource:Adapted from Blondel and Manning (2002).21_WDR_Ch10.qxd  8/14/03  10:19 AM  Page 192(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Public sector underpinnings ofservice reform193sectoral issues:discipline (decisions are real-istic and can be implemented),transparency(systematic procedures that cannot bemanipulated by individual members and thatemphasize collective responsibility),stability(no ﬂip-ﬂopping),contestability (considera-tion ofalternatives),and structured choice(only core issues come before the cabinet).519Ofthese conditions,discipline seems mostimportant.Practices vary.In the Netherlandsall items requiring cabinet approval are spec-iﬁed in the rules ofbusiness,and in Finlandalmost every government decision requirescabinet approval.In Australia the CabinetExpenditure Review Committee ensures col-lective responsibility and contestability forspending proposals—ministers have everyincentive to test the new spending proposalsoftheir colleagues so as to maximize the poolofuncommitted budget funds available fortheir own proposals.More realistic ﬁscal forecasting and dis-cussion rules that allow sensible tradeoffs toemerge between key service sectors may beneeded to avoid overcommitment at earlystages ofthe policy management process.Acabinet ofﬁce that can negotiate feasible pol-icy and legislative programs with linedepartments,analyze policy proposals,andcoordinate without itselfdeveloping policy(to avoid conﬂicts ofinterest) can thereafterhelp ensure delivery on policy and budgetproposals on these commitments.In estab-lishing budgets,a multiyear budget frame-work may help ensure adequate funding andreduce budget instability ifsupported bypoliticians and the requisite implementationcapacity.Communication,outreach,andconsultation can forestall opposition andimprove implementation plans.Finally,thecompact may need to be strengthened sothat neglect,incompetence,misapplication,or malfeasance does not prevent executivedecisions from being implemented or causethose that are implemented to be ﬂawed.Making strategic choices in publicadministration and managementChoosing how to implement good policies isas important as making them.Countrieshave experimented in the past two decadeswith different public administration ap-proaches to improving the performance andaccountability ofpublic ofﬁcials and agen-cies.Analysis suggests that the basic driversofperformance are merit-based recruitmentand promotion,adequate compensation,and reasonable autonomy from politicalinterference.520As a result ofthe differentapproaches,the share ofpublic employmentin total employment varies widely:for theperiod 1997–99 it averaged 38 percent intransition economies (16 countries),24 per-cent in industrial countries (20),and 21 per-cent in developing countries (23).521Generalgovernment employment in education andhealth and in central and subnational gov-ernment also varies considerably (ﬁgure10.5).The differences reﬂect the differentroles ofthe state and public administrationin individual countries,institutions that havehistoric roots and cannot be changedovernight.Figure 10.5Working to keep citizens educated, healthy, and safeGeneral government employment, mid- to late-1990s051015202530ZambiaUnited StatesUnited KingdomThailandSouth AfricaRussian FederationPolandMoroccoIndiaHungaryFinlandEcuadorChinaChileCanadaCambodiaBrazilBotswanaBoliviaAustraliaPercent of total employmentCentral governmentSubnational governmentEducationHealthArmed forcesNote: General government excludes employment in state-owned enterprises.

The New Public Management philoso-phy has dominated the debate on publicadministration reforms in recent years.Implemented principally in Australia,NewZealand,and the United Kingdom,it recog-nizes the government’s special role in ser-vice provision,ﬁnancing,or regulation,andthe resulting incentive problems.It seeks tostrengthen accountability by exchangingmanagement ﬂexibility for internal con-tracting among policymakers and betweenpolicymakers and providers.New PublicManagement also seeks to provide a moretransparent accounting system and tighter,private sector–like ﬁnancial managementcontrols.In its extreme form civil servantshave no tenure,and their term in ofﬁce andpromotion depend on successful comple-tion ofcontract-speciﬁed deliverables.Experience in developing countries hasbeen mixed,with some improvements inefﬁciency and uneven effects on equity.522In the weak institutional settings ofmanydeveloping countries,New Public Manage-ment reforms may impose high transactioncosts that may outweigh efﬁciency gains.As the experience with New Public Man-agement suggests,often the problem inimplementing public sector reforms is notdeciding on reform objectives but on how toget there.In Bolivia agencies were given man-agement ﬂexibility in the early 1990s,butthere were no central controls to enforceaccountability.Public administration prob-lems remained.523The Bolivian experiencehighlights the “catch-22”:central controls are194WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Figure 10.6No straight roads to success: sequencing budget reformsFiscal data andinformationEstablish financial managementcriteria in performance contracts.Deploy systems to improve the quality of fiscal data in the budget.Strengthen internal and externalaudit.Implement pay reform andrestructure line agencies.Short termMedium termDeepen accountability, includingparliamentary and civil societyinvolvement in budget scrutiny.MotivatedstaffChecks andbalances1122334455necessary when the policymaker-providerrelationship is weak and agencies lack com-petence and effective internal controls.But aslong as external controls are in place,lineagencies lack the incentive to acquire compe-tency and establish internal controls.The answer? Choosing and sequencingpublic sector reforms carefully,in line withinitial capacities,to create ﬁrmer ground forfurther reform.Pragmatic,incrementalreforms in weak institutional environments—strategic incrementalism—can alleviate,ifnotfully resolve,accountability problems whilecreating the conditions for deeper change bymodifying incentives and building capacity torespond to the next stage ofreforms.Thailandis considering a “hurdle”approach to reform-ing its centralized budget system.Line agen-cies would clear a series ofhurdles to qualifyat each level for greater budget autonomy.Inthis incremental approach to budget reform,the dismantling ofexternal controls has to besynchronized with the building ofinternalcontrols.524Other countries can follow a moretraditional but still sequenced path ofbudgetreforms,differentiating between short- andmedium-term measures and building infor-mation channels for accountability as thereforms unfold—another form ofstrategicincrementalism (ﬁgure 10.6).Formality in public sector institutions.Many aspects ofgovernment performancerest on an ingrained institutional disciplineor formality.Actual behavior follows writtenrules,or actual budget outcomes bear a closeresemblance to the legislatively agreed bud-get.525Informality emerges in weak institu-tional settings where incentives and proce-dures do not match formal rules,rewards,and procedures.526This formality gap is most evident in per-sonnel and budget problems.Teacher absen-teeism in many countries exposes the starkdifferences between explicit rules on recruit-ment,promotion,pay determination,andmonitoring and the actual,informal arrange-ment ofconnections and patronage thatdetermine who gets hired and even whetherthey have to show up at all.Lateral entry tothe civil service,intended to provide ﬂexibil-ity and contestability,becomes a window forpatronage and nepotism when ofﬁcial postsSource:Girishankar (2002).21_WDR_Ch10.qxd  8/14/03  10:20 AM  Page 194(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Public sector underpinnings ofservice reform195are bought and sold by politicians for privateproﬁt.527Checks and balances on policymak-ers are misused when reformers who arouseopposition are transferred capriciously.528Inbudget management as well a formal processofpolicy choices disciplined by budget rulescan differ greatly from the informal processin which the budget is made and remade con-stantly during execution.As noted earlier,several African countries suffer from this for-mality gap in implementing their medium-term expenditure frameworks.What are the practical implications offormality in public sector performance? Theexperience ofcountries with public manage-ment reforms suggests that the presence orabsence offormality should inﬂuence thedirection ofreform,even ifthe objectives arethe same.Where there is no strong traditionofmerit-based civil service employment,thedirection ofreform has been to set up checksand balances to legally deﬁne entry to thecivil service and the responsibilities ofcivilservants,and to build a distinct and uniﬁedcorps.Security and stability oftenure andobjectivity in promotion are used to protectagainst political interference.Where formal-ity is the norm,the ambition has been tomove in the opposite direction—to reducethe security oftenure and seniority in pro-motions and increase individual perfor-mance contracting,lateral entry,and rewardsfor results.This experience points to animportant formality threshold in makingreform choices.First-stage and second-stage reforms.Thisthreshold suggests a useful distinctionbetween ﬁrst-stage or basic reforms and sec-ond-stage or more advanced reforms (ﬁgure10.7).First-stage reforms provide incentivesto achieve or strengthen formality when thestarting point is a weak institutional setting.Second-stage reforms build on a foundationofformality in stronger institutional envi-ronments (table 10.3 suggests illustrativeexamples ofsuch reforms).In budget man-agement the basics include hardening thebudget constraint as a more top-downapproach to budget formulation andstrengthening implementation ofinput-oriented line item budgeting.Disseminatingperformance information internally and tocitizens can give budget management a basicperformance orientation (though well shortofperformance contracting).In personnelmanagement ﬁrst-stage reforms mightinclude enhancing job security to strengthenprotection from political interference.Second-stage reforms build on a culture offollowing rules and offer more choices.Inbudget management second-stage reformsinclude a much stronger orientation towardresults and performance auditing,buildingon good budget execution capacities in gov-ernment.In personnel management second-stage reforms include reducing job security,harmonizing individual rewards with perfor-mance targets,and aligning broader termsand conditions with those in the private sec-tor.But a greater contract orientation is notthe only way to go.Countries such as Canadaand Germany have adopted a process ofcon-tinuous adaptation oftheir existing systemsthat relies on granting greater ﬂexibility toachieve stronger results.Curbing corruption in service deliveryMany reforms to improve public sector per-formance and its results orientation cutacross multiple sectors.Curbing corruptionis one.Service delivery is weakened by cor-ruption,and poor people suffer its conse-quences more than others do.Understanding the economic and social costs ofcorruptionCorruption—the abuse ofpublic ofﬁce forprivate gain—is a symptom ofweak rela-tionships in the service chain.Both grandFigure 10.7From weak basics to strong foundations in public sector institutional reformsFirst-stagereformsWeak basicsInformalpublic sectorbehaviorStrategicincrementalismFormalitythresholdEntrenchedtradition of rule-complianceSecond-stagereformsto achieve or strengthenformality, discipline, andcompliance with rulesto strengthen flexibility,discretion, and a focuson resultsGreatercontractorientationContinuousadaptationSource:Adapted from World Bank (2002e).21_WDR_Ch10.qxd  8/14/03  10:21 AM  Page 195(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

corruption (involving politicians,senior ofﬁ-cials,and state capture) and petty corruption(involving lower-level ofﬁcials,administra-tive procedures,and routine public services)weaken services.The avenues for corruptionin education,health,and infrastructure aremany;they include absenteeism,patronage,construction kickbacks,procurement fraud,sale oflucrative ofﬁcial positions,false certi-ﬁcation,misuse offacilities,unwarrantedservices (unjustiﬁed caesarian deliveries,pri-vate payments to government teachers forafter-school tuition),and bribes at the pointofservice.529Bribes are the most commonface ofcorruption for poor people,as pay-ments to providers to evade approved proce-dures or to perform stated duties.Onceentrenched,corruption reduces the abilityand incentives ofpolicymakers to monitorproviders,ofcitizens to monitor politicians,and ofclients to monitor providers.Many recent studies present empiricalevidence on the costs ofcorruption.530Cor-ruption is a regressive tax,penalizing poorpeople more than others.531Poor peopleoften pay bribes to receive basic public ser-vices in education and health,whereasricher households tend to pay bribes toreceive special treatment in courts,customs,and tax authorities.Household surveysshow that the poor are the least likely toknow how to get redress when ofﬁcialsabuse their position.Transaction-intensivediscretionary services that are hard to mon-itor offer particularly broad scope for cor-ruption because providers have a stronginformation advantage over clients.Corruption in its broader sense ofthecapture ofpublic resources and decision-making affects public spending decisions.The loss ofrevenue,diversion ofpublicfunds,and evasion oftaxes associated withsuch corruption mean that governmentshave less to spend on education,health,andinfrastructure.Studies have found that cor-ruption is negatively associated with theshare ofpublic expenditures on health andeducation532and with health and educationoutcomes.Politicians may prefer to spendless on ensuring that primary health andeducation services work and more on newconstruction and infrastructure,whichoffer greater opportunities for corrup-tion.533And corruption is empirically asso-ciated with lower economic growth rates.Dealing with corruptionThere has been rapid growth in diagnostictools to measure corruption,assess servicedelivery,and make informed judgments196WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Table 10.3Walk before you runObjectiveFirst-stage reformsSecond-stage reformsBudget management Greater efﬁciency and impactIntroduce input-oriented line-item budgetingChange budget formulation and format to link reformswith some performance informationthe budget to program performance and out-year plansAggregate cost management Harden budget constraints and focus on Use block or frame budgetingimplementation and reportingAccounting reformsStrengthen cash accountingIntroduce double-entry bookkeeping and accrual accountingAuditing reformsStrengthen traditional ﬁnancial and Institutionalize performance auditing in a compliance audit and introduce some supreme audit institution and in internal auditperformance auditingPersonnel Career managementEnhance job security and protection from Decrease tenure and link to continuous management reformspolitical interferenceperformance assessmentUnity of the civil serviceCreate a legally deﬁned cadre with commonDevolve and diversify pay arrangements to  terms and conditionsprovide ﬂexibility to employersIndividual incentives Apply standard merit promotion and reward Establish annual performance targetsrules consistentlyOpenness Encourage career development within a Move toward “position-based” systems and closed system and avoid nepotismencourage lateral entrySource:Adapted from World Bank (2002e). 21_WDR_Ch10.qxd  8/20/03  5:44 PM  Page 196(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Public sector underpinnings ofservice reform197about entry points for reform.534Diagnosticsurveys,already implemented in some 20countries,usually consist ofthree separate butlinked instruments covering households,ﬁrms,and public ofﬁcials.This allows trian-gulation ofperspectives on the extent,inci-dence,locus,and causes ofcorruption.535Public expenditure tracking surveys andquantitative service delivery surveys ofspe-ciﬁc facilities can yield useful information onthe contours ofcorruption and identify entrypoints for reform.Service delivery surveys canmeasure staffincentives and efﬁciency,pro-viding information on the determinants ofservice quality and qualitative data on corrup-tion.Together,they can provide a cross-checkon the causes and consequences ofcorruptionand provide information that strengthens thevoice relationship and client power.Corruption in service delivery is a symp-tom ofan underlying systemic malaise.Deal-ing piecemeal with corruption risks treatingthe symptom and not the malaise.Curtailingcorruption requires a multipronged strategythat addresses a number ofconcerns—politi-cal accountability,institutional restraints,cit-izen voice,effective media,public disclosurelaws,competition,and good public sectorperformance (ﬁgure 10.8).A multiprongedstrategy is difﬁcult anywhere,but particularlywhere corruption is widespread and the insti-tutional setting is weak.Anticorruption diag-nostics can shed light on the patterns androot causes ofcorruption,thereby helping tosort reform priorities and suggest suitableentry points.In transition economies that arebuilding new public institutions while mas-sively redistributing state assets,opportuni-ties arise for both administrative corruptionand state capture.536Where administrativecorruption is high but state capture at thecenter is not,strengthening accountabilityFigure 10.8Many forces at play in curbing corruption in service deliveryCompetitive private sector• Incentive framework and policies• Competitive restructuring of monopolies• Regulatory reform• Transparency in corporate governance• Effective business associationsEffective public sector management• Sound public expenditure management• Merit-based civil service with monetized, adequate pay• Decentralization with accountability and local capacity• Public services that work• Access to redress mechanisms and legal system• Tax and customs administrationCurbing corruptionInstitutional restraints• Independent and effective judiciary• Independent prosecution, enforcement• Parliamentary oversight• Watchdog enforcement agenciesPolitical accountability• Political competition, credible political parties• Transparency in party ﬁnancing, public scrutiny• Open parliaments, courts, and sunshine rules• Asset declaration, conﬂict-of-interest rulesVoice, civil society participation• Freedom of information• Public hearings on draft laws• Role of media and NGOs• Governance monitoringSource:World Bank (2000a).21_WDR_Ch10.qxd  8/14/03  10:22 AM  Page 197(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

within public administration and deployingexpenditure tracking surveys and othertools for ﬁnancial accountability might bethe place to start.But where state capture atthe center is high,political accountabilityand decentralization might be the betterentry points.An independent,well-functioning judi-ciary is vital for combating corruption andoften offers a viable entry point.In enforcinglaws and providing checks and balances onthe power ofpolicymakers and providers,courts directly strengthen voice.In manycountries,however,courts are themselves acorrupt arm ofgovernment.Even ifjudgesare above reproach,lawyers,court clerks,andother court ofﬁcials on the take can add tothe web ofcorruption.The ingredients ofreform are many—freedom ofinformation,greater transparency and sunshine laws,self-regulation through reform-minded bar asso-ciations and law societies,updating ofanti-quated laws and court procedures,and theindependence,competence,and integrity ofjudicial personnel—but they are compli-cated to assemble and need time to take root.Experience suggests that important progresscan be made ifreforms focus on incentives,institutional relationships,and informationaccess rather than only on formal courtrules,procedures,and court expansion.Anti-corruption legislation that matches theenforcement capacity ofthe country,inde-pendent supreme audit organizations,andlegislative oversight can help.Managing transitions:overcoming reform hurdlesPublic sector reforms can arouse stiffopposi-tion from groups that beneﬁt from existingrelationships.How can this opposition besoftened? And how to explain the dilemma of“considerable reform in political landscapesseeded with the potential for failure”—exempliﬁed,for example,by contentiouseducation reforms in Latin America.537Thereis no easy answer,but a major factor is howpoliticians and policymakers manage thenumerous transitions in public sector andservice delivery reforms,engaging with citi-zens and frontline providers to promotechange.Experience suggests that dealing withthe political economy ofsuch transitions maybe the hardest task for reformers.While eachcountry’s experience is unique,some generalprinciples provide a starting point (box 10.7).But knowing what to push and what to holdback is an art not easy to learn or teach.Policy managers must choose appropri-ately between ﬁrst- and second-stagereforms.Even reforms such as implement-ing the budget require considerable leader-ship,capacity,and coordination acrossmany parts ofgovernment.Choosing sec-ond-stage reforms in a weak institutionalsetting can be doubly difﬁcult.Not only is198WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Reform means change and therefore oppo-sition,often political.This is particularly thecase for reform of basic services in whichgovernments are involved as providers,ﬁnanciers,or regulators,and for which thelong route of accountability thereforecomes into play.Institutional reforms in education,health,and infrastructure service deliveryare particularly complex.Multiple actors,long timetables,early costs,and late bene-ﬁts create many known and unknown vetoplayers and risks.Support for expandingaccess is easy to organize (new jobs,newcontracts,new patronage),but improvingquality is hard.Reforms can be implemented more eas-ily in pro-poor settings because of the con-sensus on social equity.Managing politicsthen often implies curbing unsustainablepopulism,promoting universal public ser-vices,and building coalitions among thepoor and the middle class so that there isbroad support for reforms.But in clientelist settings consensus onreforms may be difﬁcult to reach amongpoliticians,policymakers,and potential vetoplayers (government bureaucracies,busi-ness associations,labor unions,nongovern-mental organizations).Vested interests andpatron-client relationships may have co-opted many institutions.Reformers mustthen create political room by morepurposefully managing the politics ofreform.Though each situation is different,expe-rience suggests some basics:•Setting the terms of the debate,controllingthe agenda,and taking the high road,including getting ahead of the opposi-tion,using information disclosure andthe media to empower supporters,andseeking strategic entry points.•Striking sensible tradeoffs between com-prehensive and incremental reforms,seeking early wins for stakeholders,andsupporting reform champions and cross-agency teams that can bring along oth-ers of like mind.•Welcoming policy contestability asinevitable,but using it to mobilize stake-holders,build coalitions,and gain elec-toral credibility.•Ensuring broad,sustainable support asearly as possible,and avoiding a backlashby aiming at universal services that bene-ﬁt all users,including the poor,ratherthan special groups.•Marginalizing opponentsbefore,during,and after implementation,particularlythose with veto power,and exploitingsplits in their ranks to move beyond thestatic arithmetic of winners and losers.Managing the politics of reform is oftena top-down technocratic process led bycentral design teams and lacking participa-tion,transparency,and occasionally evenlegitimacy.This is usually a mistake.Withoutgood feedback it is difﬁcult to masterchanging areas of conﬂict.Making serviceswork for poor people requires strengthen-ing their voice in order to strengthenaccountability.This reduces,in a positiveway,the room for maneuver by reformers.Inclusive decisionmaking and implementa-tion processes are both a means and an endin the management of the politics of pro-poor service reforms.Sources:Grindle (forthcoming),Nelson (2000),Weyland (1997),and Olson (1971).BOX 10.7Managing the thorny politics ofpro-poorservice delivery reforms 21_WDR_Ch10.qxd  8/14/03  10:22 AM  Page 198(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Public sector underpinnings ofservice reform199there likely to be signiﬁcant opposition (sec-ond-stage reforms represent a greater depar-ture from the status quo than ﬁrst-stagereforms) but supporters may favor thereforms for the wrong reasons (anticipatingthe possibility ofprivate gain when complexreforms fail in an informal institutionalenvironment).So a mismatch ofreformsand initial conditions can lead to the subver-sion ofthe reforms from outside and inside.Even ifreformers recognize the need tostart with ﬁrst-stage reforms,there is theproblem ofreform traction.538Embarkingon reform is less ofa challenge where trac-tion is high—reformers have considerableleverage in society and politics,are goodcommunicators who have sold their visionto the majority ofthe population,and theinstitutions to be reformed are amenable tochange and salvageable.But in settingswhere traction is low,reformers must dealwith their slippery grip on reforms,whichcan make it hard to shape the implementa-tion ofeven ﬁrst-stage reforms.How then should reformers in low-traction settings initiate and implementreforms? The answers,clearly country-speciﬁc,go beyond the simple principlesenunciated in box 10.7.Above all,initiatingreforms in low-traction settings is a matterofopportunity and patience.To take advan-tage ofopportunities as they arise,reform-ers need to build alliances with key stake-holders in advance.They need to encouragediversity and experimentation and to learnquickly and systematically from the results.And they need to create their own opportu-nities;building on what traction does existin their settings.Evaluating and learningMonitoring and evaluation give meaning tothe accountability relationships between ser-vice clients,policymakers,and providers.Tra-ditionally,governments have associatedmonitoring and evaluation with individualareas ofthe core public sector—the audit sys-tem,discussion ofaudited ﬁnancial state-ments by the legislature—but these havetended to remain unconnected and myopic.What has been missing is the feedback onoutcomes and consequences ofactions ateach stage ofthe service delivery chain con-necting policymakers,providers,and clients.A results-based monitoring and evaluationsystem that joins information from more tra-ditional monitoring efforts with informationfrom the service delivery framework can pro-vide guidance on the institutional reformsneeded to improve service delivery.It can beparticularly useful to embed an evaluationregime within a poverty reduction strategy sothat it is possible to see what the strategy isdoing for services for poor people.The technology ofmonitoring and eval-uation is widely known and usually speciﬁcto the service and delivery mechanism.539What is more important to focus on are theunderlying incentives for monitoring andevaluation,and how demand for informa-tion can be made to drive the supply.Threeissues stand out:the institutional frame-work for monitoring and evaluation,therole ofsystematic program assessment andits links back into policymaking,and theimportance ofdissemination.Creating a new information system thatresults in greater transparency,accountabil-ity,and visibility will alter political powerequations.It can challenge conventionalwisdom on program performance,drivenew resource allocation decisions,and callinto question the leadership ofthoseresponsible.Box 10.8 highlights the impor-tance ofunderstanding the institutional andpolitical dimensions ofa results-based mon-itoring and evaluation system and howdemand for monitoring and evaluationshould drive the supply,rather than theother way around.Efforts to improve statis-tical systems,for example,have oftenfocused on ﬁxing supply problems bystrengthening national statistical systems tocollect,process,and disseminate data ratherthan on understanding the sources ofdemand.This has led in some cases to anoversupply ofinformation:in Tanzania,forexample,health information systemsabound,but it is still difﬁcult to obtain accu-rate estimates ofservice delivery coverage.Without some understanding ofhowinformation is used,those who collect itmay see the process as time consuming andunrewarding,leading to poor complianceand low quality.As decentralization pro-ceeds in many countries,it is important to21_WDR_Ch10.qxd  8/14/03  10:23 AM  Page 199(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

build decentralized monitoring and evalua-tion capacity so that central and local sys-tems are complementary.As emphasized elsewhere in this Report,systematic program evaluation can be apowerful tool for showing what works andwhat does not.Given the complexity ofpublic sector reforms and the difﬁculty ofchoosing entry points and appropriatesequencing,governments are constantlytrying new policy and program approaches.Some ofthem work well,many producemediocre results,and many fail.But unlessthere is systematic evaluation ofreforms,there is no way to be sure that they workedbecause ofthe policy or program or becauseofother reasons.540And unless the resultsplay a major part in the design ofsubse-quent delivery mechanisms,there is no wayto be sure that governments can succeedwhen they decide to scale up.Finally,as chapter 5 and the rest oftheReport emphasize,wide dissemination ofthe results ofmonitoring and evaluationactivities is crucial to improvements in ser-vice delivery.Ifnot widely disseminatedinside and outside government throughmechanisms tailored to speciﬁc audiences,the results ofmonitoring and evaluationactivities may not live up to their potentialfor improving service delivery.200WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004•Are champions of results-based monitor-ing and evaluation evident within thecountry? •What reforms are underway or plannedto which a results-based monitoring andevaluation initiative might be linked?•Who will use results-based monitoringand evaluation information to assess ser-vice delivery performance?•What management framework within thegovernment will oversee theintroduction and operation of a results-based monitoring and evaluationsystem? •Are there links between budget andresource allocation procedures andexisting monitoring and evaluationinformation?•Who regularly collects and analyzes mon-itoring and evaluation information toassess government performance,eitherinside or outside the government? •Where can local capacity be found inpublic management,surveying,evalua-tion,and data management to supportthe supply of and the demand for results-based monitoring and evaluation?•Are there proposed or existing donor-supported initiatives,such as a PRSP,towhich a results-based monitoring andevaluation initiative might be linked?Source:Based on Kusek,Rist,and White (2003).BOX 10.8Ready for results?21_WDR_Ch10.qxd  8/14/03  10:23 AM  Page 200(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

health agents were gradually expanded toinclude a doctor,a nurse,a nurse’s aid,andﬁve to six community health agents forevery 800 families.This Family Health Program was basedon the success ofthe São Paulo,Porto Ale-gre,and Niterói municipalities with “familyphysicians.”It added follow-up ofat-riskfamilies and home care for chronic diseasesto the existing services.The family physi-cians and nurses’aides also provide curativecare and referrals to hospitals.By 2002,150,000 Family Health teams were reaching45 million people.Health outcomes,1987–2001Some ofthe decreases in infant mortalityand malnutrition can be attributed to theincreased coverage ofimmunization,oralrehydration therapy,and breastfeeding (ﬁg-ure 2).Socioeconomic inequalities in cov-erage were also reduced,and the greatestimprovements were made among the poor-est ofthe population.541Output mea-sures—such as immunization,oral rehy-dration therapy,breastfeeding,and childweighing—have also improved.Anecdotal evidence points to impacts inother states.Implementing the FamilyHealth Program in the town ofCamaragibebrought infant mortality down from 65 per1,000 live births in 1993 to 17 at the end ofIn the 1980s the socioeconomic indica-tors in Ceará,a state ofabout 7 millionpeople in northeast Brazil,were amongthe worst in the country.The infant mortal-ity rate was around 100 per 1,000 livebirths.Fewer than 30 percent ofmunicipal-ities had a nurse.And essential health ser-vices reached only 20–40 percent ofthepopulation.In 1986 the state governmentbegan a massive effort to reduce infantdeaths.It succeeded.By 2001 infant mortal-ity was down to 25 per 1,000 live births.Sending health workers to poorhouseholdsThe Ceará state government began in 1987to recruit,train,and deploy communityhealth agents.By the early 1990s healthagents were visiting 850,000 families amonth,the ﬁrst public service to regularlyreach nearly all local communities.The monthly family visits and familyrecords improved oral rehydration therapy,breastfeeding,immunization,antenatalcare,and growth monitoring—as well astreatment ofpneumonia,diarrhea,andother diseases.By 2001 more than 170,000 communityhealth agents covered 80 million Brazilians(ﬁgure 1).In 1994 the teams ofcommunitythe 1990s,and in Palmas the incidence ofdiarrhea fell by half,with antenatal carecoverage doubling between 1997 and1998.542Balancing decentralization with a results orientationMobilizing actorsUsing matching funds to motivate munici-palities to implement new programs,Ceará state policymakers struck a balancebetween decentralizing responsibilities tothe municipalities and keeping a resultsfocus through state control over keyaspects ofthe program.Strategies were also developed tostrengthen community leverage overhealth providers and to strengthen com-munity voice.The widely publicized selec-tion ofa large number ofcommunityhealth agents from the communitieshelped to “socialize”the program.Com-munity organizations were involved in thesecond round ofassessments for theMunicipal Seal ofApproval—a program togive incentives to municipalities toimprove outcomes (box 1).FinancingSeveral ﬁnancing mechanisms coveredannual program costs ofroughly $1.50 perbeneﬁciary.In line with the 1988 constitu-tion and 2001 health funding laws,munici-palities can retain tax revenues but mustspend 25 percent on education and 10 per-cent on health.The salaries ofcommunityhealth agents ($60 a month),and the costsofsupervision and drugs are paid directlyby the state.Municipalities are required tocover only the salaries ofnurse-supervisors($300 a month),but many voluntarily sup-port other costs.The national government offers match-ing block grants to municipalities for edu-cation and health as an incentive to imple-ment priority programs.The grants forminimum basic health care amount to 10170,000 community health agents reaching 80 million BraziliansOne ofBrazil’s poorest states,Ceará reduced infant mortality dramatically in the late 1980s and 1990s.A major effort ofthe local government motivated health workers,municipalities,local communities,and families to work for better health.Cearáspotlight on Figure 1The number of community healthagents increased dramatically020304060708090100105020011994North-EastNorthCenter-EastSouthSouth-EastThousandsSource:Brazil Ministry of Health (2001).Figure 2Changes in health and nutritionindicators in Ceará 1987–94 and 1997–2001019871994200119974050201030607080PercentIMRMalnutritionSource:1987 to 1994 from Victora and others (2000a); 1997 to2001 from Fuentes and Niimi (2002).22_pgs 201-202_Ch010Spot.qxd  8/14/03  3:41 PM  Page 201(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

203Timeo danaos et dona ferentes.—I fear the Greekseven when they bear gifts.Laocoön on the Trojan HorseIn many developing countries,externaldonors support service reform.In middle-income or large low-income countries,theymostly pilot innovations or implementdemonstration projects.Ifchosen strategi-cally and evaluated properly,these projectscan be powerful.In other low-income coun-tries the story is quite different.Donors sup-ply 20 percent or more ofpublic resourcesin more than 60 low-income countries.Andthey supply more than 40 percent ofpublicresources in at least 30 poor countries—suchas Bolivia,Madagascar,Nepal,and Tanzania.For these countries aid ﬂows are obviouslyimportant for service delivery.The international community has comea long way in understanding what makesaid more effective,focusing on the selectionofrecipient countries.543This chapter sug-gests that,along with country selectivity,theway donors provide their aid matters a lot.Donors still underestimate how difﬁcultit is to inﬂuence reform without undercut-ting domestic accountabilities.Too aware offailures in the key relationships ofaccount-ability in recipient countries,donors oftenbypass them.This can produce good iso-lated projects,but it can also weaken the aidrecipient’s internal systems and account-ability relationships (chapters 3 to 6).Thischapter suggests that:•Donors need to pay more attention tothe problems in inﬂuencing servicereform in recipient countries.•They should strengthen the critical rela-tionships among policymakers,providers,and clients.In circumventing those rela-tionships,they can undermine the deliv-ery ofservices.•Donors should support recipient institu-tions by evaluating innovations system-atically,by harmonizing and realigningtheir ﬁnancial assistance and knowledgetransfers with the recipient’s servicedelivery (particularly where aid’s shareofspending is large),and by focusing onoutcomes and results.•In good country environments wherethere are genuine reformers,donorsshould also integrate their support in therecipient’s development strategy,budget,and service delivery system.•In low-income countries coming out ofconﬂict or with weak institutions,donorsshould support urgent social and otherservices,while identifying mechanismsthat build transparent public institutionsin the longer term.Pooling ofaid willreduce transaction costs.This is all ﬁne,but the multiple objectivesofforeign aid create incentives for donors tocontrol their interventions directly ratherthan to align them with the recipient’s ser-vice delivery systems.Because oftheseincentives,reforming aid will not be easy.Yetfor service reform to succeed,donors have toattach an even higher priority to aid effec-tiveness and development outcomes.Aid and accountabilitiesAid differs in important ways from domes-tically ﬁnanced services.The beneﬁciariesand ﬁnanciers are not just distinct—theylive in different countries,with differentpolitical constituencies.544This geographi-cal and political separation—between ben-eﬁciaries in the recipient country and tax-payers in the donor country—breaks thenormal performance feedback loop in ser-vice delivery (ﬁgure 11.1).For example,Donors and service reform11chapter23_WDR_Ch11.qxd  8/14/03  10:30 AM  Page 203(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

204WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004beneﬁciaries in a recipient country may beable to observe the performance ofaidagencies.But they cannot reward or punishthe policymakers responsible for this per-formance in donor countries.The brokenfeedback loop induces greater incentivebiases in aid than in domestic programs.Soaid effectiveness is determined not only bythe performance ofthe recipient but also bythe incentives embedded in the institutionalenvironment ofaid agencies.Understand-ing these incentives is central to any reformofaid to support service delivery better.The divergence and distance betweenconstituencies and clients may be impor-tant—but there is more.Even ifdonor con-stituencies adopted client feedback as aparamount criterion for aid,there wouldstill be difﬁculties in exercising externalinﬂuence without undermining localaccountability relationships.To illustratethe inherent problem ofexternal actors,consider enterprise ﬁnance.Whenﬁnanciers or venture capitalists want toinﬂuence an enterprise they are investing in,they become an equity holder and perhapsrequest a seat on the company’s board.Clearly it would be politically infeasible fordonors to request seats in the recipient’scabinet.Yet the inﬂuence that donors exer-cise on the recipient’s public spending oftenresembles that ofan equity ﬁnancier.Strengthen—don’t weaken—the compactWhen aid ﬂows are substantial relative to therecipient’s resources,donors affect the com-pacts between policymakers and providerorganizations (chapter 6) in many ways.Byinﬂuencing spending patterns and bud-getary processes,donors interfere directlywith the design ofthe compact.And bygoing straight to provider organizations,donors sidestep the policymaker as well asthe compact.Donors affect the recipient’s spendingpatterns and budgetary processes in manyways:545•Donors may support only capital spend-ing (construction) and expect the gov-ernment to supply complementaryinputs (stafﬁng,maintenance).Govern-ments often fail to ﬁnance the comple-mentary inputs.•Donors may fund projects that govern-ments are not interested in.This contra-dicts ownership,though it can workwhere a good pilot project encourages anew approach through its demonstra-tion effect—or where a one-time inter-vention is needed.•Donors may give aid to a priority sector andassume that government spending from itsown resources remains unchanged.Thisruns into fungibility because governmentsattempt to smooth spending by adjustingtheir own allocations.546•Donors may set targets for the share ofspending in particular sectors as condi-tions for aid ﬂows.Consider the currentdonor preference for social sectors,whichappears to have increased both recipi-ents’public spending on these sectorsFigure 11.1The feedback loop between beneﬁciaries and donor country taxpayers is brokenRecipientPoliticians andpolicymakersClient powerDonorPoliticians andpolicymakersTaxpayers andinterest groupsAid agencyPoor peopleProgrammatic aidSelf-help projectsInvestment projectsProvidersVoiceCompact23_WDR_Ch11.qxd  8/14/03  10:31 AM  Page 204(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Donors and service reform205and the social sector’s share ofaid (from14 percent ofthe aid ﬂows in 1991 to 34percent in 2000).547But strong donorpreferences can leave other importantareas underfunded or set perverse incen-tives in the privileged sector.In Zambiaprotecting social spending led to deepcuts in rural infrastructure spending—possibly creating more rural poverty.548To avoid such distortions,donors candiscuss priorities with policymakers andwork to shape public expenditure duringthe annual budget cycle.But the recipienthas to have a budget process that functionsfairly well.Many donors see a need to align aid withthe recipient’s compact between policy-makers and providers.But there are othertendencies as well.Global funds,which areprivate-public partnerships at the globallevel,have chosen to provide funding on aproject basis directly to service providers inpoor countries.549The new health-relatedglobal funds also develop policies for globalprocurement and distribution ofcommodi-ties,such as mosquito nets,vaccines,andessential medicines.In many ways,the delivery ofglobalfunds—from a global source ofﬁnancedirectly to the local provider—reﬂects theneed for donors to demonstrate that thefunds are additional to what otherwisewould have been given.But it might alsoreﬂect dissatisfaction with the functioningofthe recipient’s relationships ofaccount-ability and with aid agencies.But it is notclear that this is a sustainable solution to theinstitutional problems.Evidence fromUganda indicates that global funds can pitthe recipient’s policymakers—in charge ofthe overall spending program—against itsprovider organizations,who directly lobbyfor off-budget funds at the internationallevel (box 11.1).Parallel ﬁnancing mecha-nisms can also undermine efforts to ratio-nalize expenditures,reform governmentsystems,and increase transparency at thecountry level.Donors interact directly with providerorganizations at various levels.Some aidagencies choose to work with line min-istries.Others choose to engage providersunder local governments.And others godirectly to frontline providers,such ashealth clinics or schools.Sectoral ministriesindependently lobby donors for funding.From the donor perspective competitionamong ministries,departments,and otherorganizations permits a better selectionprocess—because hopeful recipients will dotheir best to reveal as much information aspossible to attract donors.The result:recip-ients’policymakers lose control oftheexpenditure program,because the ﬁnance isoff-budget and the activities bypass thecompact.Incoherent spending allocationsand uneven coverage ofservices ensue.Similar competition can occur amongdonors,making incentive problems worse.When the recipient agency knows that ifone donor threatens to withdraw due to therecipient agency’s poor performance otherdonors will step in,few incentives exist forimproving its performance.550Some donors,including the World Bank,even circumvent provider organizations bysetting up autonomous or semi-autonomousproject implementation units for their inter-ventions.Advocates ofproject implementa-tion units recognize that the arrangementscan undermine local capacity building,createsalary distortions,and weaken the compactbetween the policymaker and the providerorganization.But they argue that the betterresults outweigh the costs.A study ofabout100 World Bank projects in the Latin Amer-ica and Caribbean Region shows otherwise:that project implementation units have noIt is like a hungry boy who sees ripe man-goes hanging abundantly from a tree,buthe is not allowed to pick the fruits.The Min-istry of Health remains needy,while donormoney hangs around.As part of the budgetand medium-term expenditure framework,the Ministry of Finance sets a limit to theamount of money that can be spent onhealth—as it does for all sectors—refusingto earmark excess funds for health fromglobal funds.The Ministry of Finance arguesthat there are a whole host of importantthings that poor people need and thatthere are not enough resources around toprovide all of them.But health ofﬁcials insist that the Min-istry of Finance is constructing ceilingsbelow ﬂoors and that it costs much more todeliver health services than the budget allo-cation it receives.The Ministry of Financecounters by saying that the country’s attrac-tiveness to donors depends on its reputa-tion for sound macroeconomicmanagement.Global funds risk undermin-ing this by providing resources outside thenormal budget process.It is notgovernment’s intention to turn away addi-tional resources,ﬁnance ofﬁcials say,but it isimportant that such resources bechanneled through the regular budgetprocess.Source:Adapted from The New Vision,Uganda’smain daily newspaper.BOX 11.1The debate over global funds: Uganda23_WDR_Ch11.qxd  8/14/03  10:31 AM  Page 205(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

signiﬁcant positive impact on project out-comes,while the likely sustainability ofresults clearly suffered.551A parallel study inthe Eastern Europe and Central Asia Regionproduced similar ﬁndings.552In Bangladesh donors responded to a cri-sis by setting up a separate project manage-ment unit for the Bangladesh Arsenic Miti-gation Water Supply Project—to speedilyaddress arsenic contamination in drinkingwater (chapter 9).The unit bypassed the tra-ditional water engineering departments,deemed too inﬂexible to respond to theemergency.Two years later it has fallen farshort ofexpectations.The government isexpected to close the project shortly,arguingthat the unit,having bypassed government,was unable to deliver on the ground.To staffproject implementation units,donors tend to hire the most highly skilledcivil servants,often at salaries many timeswhat they could earn from the government.553In Kenya a World Bank agricultural projectpaid eight local staffbetween $3,000 and$6,000 a month,many times the $250 avail-able to a senior economist in the civil ser-vice.554Another study found that of20Kenyan government economists receivingmaster’s degree training in a donor-fundedprogram between 1977 and 1985,15 wereworking for aid agencies or nongovernmentalorganizations (NGOs)—or for their projectsby 1994.The study concluded:“elite externalmaster’s degrees are,in effect,passports out ofthe public sector.”555In countries with manydonors,salaries are likely to be bid up evenmore,as donors compete for qualiﬁed staff.A better choice to improve aid effective-ness is to phase these units out and to workwith the recipient’s provider organizations,building their capacity.And it should takeplace within the compact between the recip-ient’s policymakers and service providers.But this requires changes in incentives in aidagencies (see the last section ofthis chapter).Let provider organizationsmanageDonors affect management ofprovider orga-nizations in recipient countries in at leastthree ways:by the fragmentation ofaid in alarge number ofdonor projects,by the choiceofactivities,and by the choice ofinputs.The costs ofaid fragmentationThe problem with aid fragmentation is notthat individual projects are misconceived—it is that there are too many projects for anyto work efﬁciently.When a project’s ﬁxedcosts are high and there are returns to scale,fragmented aid can be wasteful.Further-more,when donors each have only a smallshare ofthe total aid in a recipient country,their stake in the country’s development,including capacity building,may bereduced relative to their concern for thesuccess oftheir own projects.Fragmenta-tion also imposes high transactions costs onrecipients,with large amounts ofofﬁcials’time taken up by donor requirements.Little systematic evidence is available onfragmentation and its effect on the manage-ment ofprovider organizations.One source,though limited,is the Development Gate-way database,with records on about 340,000aid projects and programs across the devel-oping world.556Using the database to quan-tify the extent ofdonor fragmentation yieldsa mean index value for donor fragmentationacross recipients of0.87.557(Index valuesincrease with the number ofdonors active inthe country and with greater parity amongdonors.Low values indicate a smaller num-ber ofdonors,or that some donors domi-nate.558) For example,Tanzania has a highindex value of0.92,with more than 80 aidagencies having funded 7,000 projects overtime.A similar index computed fromanother data set—annual aid disburse-ments—suggests that donor fragmentationis on the rise (ﬁgure 11.2).559High fragmentation indices could reﬂectdonor specialization in different sectors,sothat fragmentation would be low in eachsector.But mean levels ofthe index are onlyslightly lower within individual sectors:0.85for education,0.77 for health,and 0.78 forwater projects.High fragmentation valuesfor most recipients show that donors do notspecialize very much,either by sector or bycountry.Most donors are active in manysectors,in most countries:a typical recipientnation in 2000 received aid from about 15bilaterals and 10 multilaterals (table 11.1).How does donor fragmentation affectthe recipient’s provider organizations? Asmentioned,little systematic evidence is206WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 20040.551975198019851990199520000.600.650.70Donor fragmentation indexNote: The higher the index, the greater thedegree of donor fragmentation.Source:Knack and Rahman (2003).Figure 11.2Donor fragmentation: onthe rise23_WDR_Ch11.qxd  8/14/03  10:32 AM  Page 206(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Donors and service reform207available.One study ﬁnds an associationbetween rising fragmentation and declin-ing bureaucratic quality in high-aid coun-tries and in Sub-Saharan Africa,control-ling for changes in per capita income andother variables (ﬁgure 11.3).560This ﬁnd-ing suggests that donors with a small shareofthe aid in a country may focus more ondelivering successful projects,even at theexpense ofgovernment capacity—forexample,by hiring the most qualiﬁed gov-ernment administrators to run their pro-jects.This collective action problem may beless severe where there is a dominantdonor,who has a greater incentive to take abroader and longer-term view ofthe coun-try’s development.High fragmentation means high transac-tion costs for recipients.Tanzanian govern-ment ofﬁcials have to prepare about 2,000reports ofdifferent kinds to donors andreceive more than 1,000 donor delegationseach year.These requirements tax ratherthan build provider organizations’limitedcapacities,diverting efforts toward satisfy-ing donor obligations rather than reportingto domestic policymakers.Recognizing theadverse effects,donor agencies have recentlyinitiated measures to curb compliance costsand streamline operational policies,proce-dures and practices,focusing on ﬁnancialmanagement,procurement,environmentalassessment,and reporting and monitoring.High fragmentation may have an evenstronger impact in low-income countrieswith weak policies and institutional environ-ments.This is because the domestic capacityto implement reforms is typically highlyconstrained—both the political capital ofreformers and the technical capacity oftheadministration.Fragmented donor interven-tions create pressure on existing capacity,bydemanding both political and administrativeefforts to implement change across a widevariety ofareas at the same time.Aid ﬂowsare often at low per capita levels,so a largenumber ofprojects may also mean that theaverage value ofeach project is small,leadingto high overhead and transaction costs.But change has been slow.The emphasishas so far been to ﬁnd common interna-tional standards and principles at the aidagency level,rather than to adapt donorbehavior to the procedures used by therecipient’s service providers in their report-ing to domestic policymakers.Exceptionsare beginning to emerge,including Tanza-nia,Bolivia,Vietnam,and Ethiopia,wheredonors are planning to help the governmentdevelop a harmonization program ratherthan limit it to the donor community.Donor inﬂuence on choice ofactivities and inputsDonors also inﬂuence the choice ofactivi-ties within a sector.They tend to be gener-ous with training.In Malawi trainingaccounts for a staggering $4.5 million,or 10percent ofdonor spending on health care ayear.561It is hard to believe that the returnon this investment matches the cost or thatthe government would spend this much ontraining ifit had the choice.And the realcost appears to be even higher:staffmay beabsent from work for long periods on train-ing courses.Training opportunities areoften a form ofincentive for staff.Ifso,thefunds would likely be better used ifthesponsoring donors provided them directlyto supplement salaries through the budget.The $4.5 million spent on training healthworkers in Malawi would translate on aver-age to a 50 percent increase in salary for allhealth care staff.The input mix in aid-ﬁnanced publicspending often differs from that in recipientspending.For example,donors provide farTable 11.1So many donors . . .Type of aid donorBilateral donors onlyBilateral and multilateral donorsNumber of recipients with 1–9 donors313Number of recipients with 10–19 donors9327Number of recipients with 20–29 donors2269Number of recipients with 30–39 donors040Average number of donors per recipient1426Median number of donors per recipient1623Note:The number of donors was calculated by using ﬁgures for total ofﬁcial development assistance (ODA) in 2000,provided by the OECD DAC.

more technical assistance (and project vehi-cles) than the recipient would buy ifit hadthe money.In Malawi technical assistanceaccounts for 24 percent ofdonor spending onhealth.562A major obstacle to addressing thisissue is the shortage ofdata.Many recipientbudgetary systems have much better data onthe input mix for domestically ﬁnancedexpenditures than they do on donor projects,which are sometimes treated as single lines inthe budget.Donor ofﬁcials have weak incen-tives to provide full information to recipientgovernments.Public expenditure reviews,often critical ofgovernment spending,letdonors offlightly.To improve scrutiny,betterdata are urgently needed.Increase client powerClient power—the relationship betweenbeneﬁciary and service provider—tends tobe weak in many developing countries.Thishas long presented donors with a dilemma.Should they help strengthen the linksbetween users and existing providers? Orshould they ﬁnd a way around the recipi-ent’s service delivery system to ensure thataid-funded services reach poor people? Thisbecomes even more complicated in heavilyHIV/AIDS-affected countries,those com-ing out ofconﬂict,and those with weak andcorrupt public institutions.Ofﬁcial donoragencies have followed the example oftheirnongovernmental counterparts,approach-ing communities and user groups directly,through sharply increased funding forsocial funds and self-help projects.Threemain problems surface in these activities:anundermining ofgovernment and otherlocal capacity,weakened prospects ofsus-tainability,and the capture ofbeneﬁts byelites (chapter 4).In principle,social funds and self-helpprojects could operate within the recipient’sservice delivery system.They could alsoserve as entry points for the policy dialoguewith policymakers and providers and hencebuild local government capacity rather thanundermine it.But like many other projects,they tend to be operated directly by donorswith little integration.Most assessments ofsocial funds and self-help projects focus on poverty targeting.Overall,the evidence suggests that centralizedsystems do better at identifying poor com-munities than at identifying poor householdsor poor individuals.563The effectiveness oftargeting varies widely,which suggests theimportance ofunobserved attributes ofcom-munities.Some studies show that public ser-vice delivery—measured by access to infra-structure or outcomes—improved throughcommunity involvement,564and others,thatperformance could be better.565Yet social funds and self-help interven-tions continue to face serious challenges ofsustainability.One challenge arises from thecultural and social context ofcommunitiesand their capacity for collective action.It isnot clear that the self-help approach canbeneﬁt fractured,heterogeneous communi-ties that have little capacity for collectiveaction.Alternative methods ofservice deliv-ery may suit such poor communities better.But there is little factual evidence on thisbecause evaluations typically do not com-pare social funds and self-help projects withconventional service delivery mechanisms.Nor do they take into account the negativeside effects.The sustainability ofself-helpprojects can be in jeopardy ifline ministriesor local governments ignore them once theyare completed.Unless communities canensure continuing support for recurrentcosts and staff,they may not be able to sus-tain their project.Donors need to disburse funds fast and toshow visible results quickly to supporters ortaxpayers.A recent study in a Sahelian coun-try,also applicable elsewhere,shows thatthese needs may be incompatible withreducing poverty.566When donors are impa-tient,when they compete with similar agen-cies for good projects,when they do not havethe capacity to monitor activities on theground,they may choose particular groupsto work with—risking the capture ofdonorfunds by elites.Impatient donors may evenmake the patient donors attach greaterweight to quick results,undermining theprospects for poverty reduction.Thisbecomes a serious problem when malevolentelites capture donor funds for private gain.But that need not be the case (box 11.2).Social funds and self-help projects shouldbe designed for each context,with best-prac-tice templates as initial guides only.Rapid208WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Figure 11.3Bureaucratic qualitydeclines with donor fragmentation in Sub-Saharan Africa–0.05–0.0250Change in donor fragmentation index*Change in bureaucratic quality index*0.0250.05–202*After controlling for the effect of initial level ofbureaucratic quality, growth of per capitaincome, growth of population, and level of aid inrelation to GDP (averaged over the period).Note: The scatter plot shows the partial relation-ship between the change in bureaucratic quality(1982–2001) and donor fragmentation (based onproject counts).

Donors and service reform209expansion ofsuch projects by donors withlittle experience may not be feasible.Ratherthan implementing numerous enclave oper-ations in a single recipient country,donorscould pool support openly and transparentlyto achieve better results in scaling up andpreventing elite capture—even when bypass-ing the policymaker-provider relationship ina failed state or low-income country understress.567Where conditions are right,thepooling ofaid should not stop with thedonors—it should extend to national andlocal governments and other providers,pri-vate for-proﬁt and not-for-proﬁt.Donors can also promote other initia-tives to enhance client power.They canencourage citizen monitoring ofserviceproviders,such as report cards and publicexpenditure tracking surveys (chapters 5and 10,and see spotlight on Uganda).Theycan help monitor the use ofservices andsupport beneﬁt-incidence analyses to iden-tify the groups missing out.Keep in mind,however,that involving providers in thedesign ofthe monitoring process is criticalto ensuring buy-in for the results.Promote voicePromoting citizen voice through formalpolitical mechanisms or through informaladvocacy groups or public information cam-paigns is one ofthe most difﬁcult endeavorsfor donors.Yet donors attempt to do it inmany ways—a testament to the importanceofvoice in service reform.The attemptsinclude imposing conditions and setting per-formance criteria on aid ﬂows where voice isweak,providing direct support to democra-tic governance,and actively promotingtransparency and participatory processes.By imposing conditions donors try toreplace the weak voice ofcitizens in disci-plining policymakers (chapter 5).Yet donorconditions are fundamentally different fromcitizen voice,which is diffuse,after-the-fact,and a long-term process.In the 1980s struc-tural adjustment loans extended conditionsin projects to a wide spectrum ofgovern-ment economic policies,processes,and pub-lic spending.There is ample evidence todaythat conditions based on promises do notwork well,because they undermine owner-ship ofthe reform program.568When policymakers are not encouragedto develop their own positions on,say,pri-vatization ofwater supply or other services,but rely on donor conditions in takingaction,they can more easily deny responsi-bility for a later failure.It is not the quantityofaid that makes the recipient’s policiesgood or institutional reforms happen.Empirical studies show that aid ﬁnance isineffective in inducing policy reform in abad policy environment.569What worksThere are more questions than answers on howself-help projects really work.Do they improveparticipation and targeting? Do they buildcapacity for collective action? One way toanswer these questions is to analyze how theprocess works in a particular political,social,andcultural setting.A case study of the Jamaica SocialInvestment Fund integrates quantitative andqualitative data from ﬁve pairs of randomlyselected communities.Each pair has similarsocial and economic characteristics,but onlyone of the pair participated in the social fund.The fund typically uses NGOs to mobilize com-munities to participate.The NGOs work closelywith local elites,such as pastors and teachers.Project selection is not generally participatorybut is driven by this small,motivated group.Once construction of a service facilitycommences,however,the group is often able tomotivate a larger group to contribute to theproject.And once completed,the service facilityis generally viewed as belonging to the commu-nity and there seems to be wide satisfactionwith the outcome.But it also appears that thepositive social beneﬁts from a community-based intervention may be difﬁcult to sustain inthe long term,particularly in communities besetby deep divisions.Quantitative data on 500 randomly chosenhouseholds from the same ﬁve pairs of commu-nities mirror these qualitative ﬁndings.Within-community “preference targeting”is poor,withthree of the ﬁve participating communities notobtaining the project preferred by a majority.Bythe end of construction,however,80 percent ofthe community members expressed satisfactionwith the outcome.More educated andnetworked individuals dominate the selectionprocess and are more likely to have their priori-ties met.The Social Investment Fund alsoappears to have improved trust and capacity forcollective action,but the gains are greater formore educated and networked individuals.Sothe process might be characterized as “benevo-lent capture”:elites dominate the process but ina way that eventually beneﬁts the community.Both participating and nonparticipating com-munities show more community-baseddecisionmaking,indicative of a broad-basedeffort to promote participatory development.The Jamaica Social Investment Fund showsthat self-help does not necessarily “empowerthe poor”and can be either supply or demanddriven.But community involvement does seemto make service delivery more effective byincreasing ownership and participation and byimproving the capacity for collective action.Source:Rao (2003) and Rao and Ibáñez (2003).BOX 11.2Social Investment Fund: Jamaica 23_WDR_Ch11.qxd  8/14/03  10:33 AM  Page 209(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

better is choosing recipients more carefully,based on performance (country selectivity),and setting conditions that reward reformscompleted rather than those promised.570Traditional conditionality does not workwell.How can donors then allocate aid so thatit provides a strong incentive for the recipientto promote citizen voice and undertake ser-vice reform and thus increases aid effective-ness? In principle,there is broad agreementtoday that,instead ofconditions,the aidcompact needs to contain veriﬁable indica-tors that can measure performance.But,inpractice,the use ofperformance indicatorshas not yet changed the incentives underpin-ning the relationship between recipients anddonors.571 Few performance indicators used todaymeasure outcomes;most still measureinputs and processes.So far the link betweenthese operational performance indicatorsand the outcome targets articulated inpoverty reduction strategies remains vague.And there are few transparent mechanismsto allow donors to signal the conditions for arecipient to expect an increase or reductionin aid.Initiatives to improve the measure-ment ofresults are under way,but it will taketime to establish an effective link betweenthe volume ofaid and performance.There is also tension between the moni-toring and incentive functions ofperfor-mance indicators.Donors,preoccupied withﬁduciary concerns,tend to keep a close watchon the programs they support—hence thefocus on short-term process undertakingsrather than genuine outcome measures astriggers for performance evaluation.572Butthis can lead instead to micromanagement,exactly what the new system ofperformance-based conditions is intended to avoid.Thistension,ifunresolved,makes aid compactsincoherent.Many bilateral donors go further andsupport electoral participation and democ-racy directly and use aid to induce andreward such reforms (box 11.3).For exam-ple,donors rewarded Ghana for holding freeelections in 1992,despite the excessive publicspending prior to the elections that resultedin poor macroeconomic performance.Donors also support informal mecha-nisms to strengthen citizen voice.One is topromote participatory processes in thedevelopment ofpoverty reduction strategiesand budgetary processes (box 11.4).But aidagencies and recipient governments some-times have different views on what form theparticipation should take.Aid agencies sel-dom hold a dialogue with parliamentarians,stressing instead the extragovernmentalaspects ofparticipation,involving a widerange ofcivil society.Members ofparlia-ment sometimes view the donor emphasison civil society as undermining the legiti-macy ofelected representatives,particularlyin emerging democracies.They also ques-tion the legitimacy ofNGOs selected tospeak for “the people.”Donors have encouraged many low-income countries to open policy debatesand discussions when preparing povertyreduction strategies.Governments areworking to bring the views ofa wider rangeofstakeholders into discussions.Madagas-car,Rwanda,and Vietnam now have moretimely information,make greater use of210WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004Most bilateral donors explicitly include pro-moting democracy among the goals of theiraid programs.The U.S.Agency for Interna-tional Development alone spends morethan $700 million a year on  programs—supporting free elections,fostering civil soci-ety organizations,and strengthening par-liaments,judiciaries,and political parties.Election assistance is the highest-proﬁlecomponent of democracy promotion.Partic-ularly in postconﬂict situations,numerousbilateral donors,international organizations—such as the United Nations,the Organizationof American States,and the Organization ofSecurity and Cooperation in Europe—andprivate organizations send observermissions and provide assistance to electionadministrators.More than 80 internationalgroups observed the 1996 elections inNicaragua.Aid for promoting democracy hasincreased from 0.5 percent of total ofﬁcialdevelopment assistance in 1991 to 5 percentin 2000.The donor approach to democratic gov-ernance—democracy,participation,humanrights,and the rule of law—has striking simi-larities to the rest of aid:a heroic short-termeffort to get countries through a suddentakeoff to democracy.Rather than try toreproduce certain types of institutions,donors could more actively nurture corepolitical processes and values,such as repre-sentation,accountability,tolerance,andopenness.Legislative aid programs haveoften failed due to donors’lack of knowledgeabout the political and personal dynamics ofthe institutions they are trying to reshape,their determination to apply models that donot ﬁt the local situation,and their focus ontechnical solutions (such as new rules forstaffers or Internet access) for deeply politicalproblems.To overcome some of these problems,the Swedish International DevelopmentAgency (SIDA) has initiated a new type ofanalysis of the underlying interests andpower relationships as part of a program tosupport political institutions in BurkinaFaso,Ethiopia,Kenya,and Mali.In electoralassistance SIDA has moved to longer-termprograms and closer

Donors and service reform211local languages,and use participation morethan consultation.There is also evidencethat these processes are inﬂuencing a shifttoward broader consultation on govern-ment decisions beyond the poverty reduc-tion strategy.But major challenges remainin regularizing greater openness in govern-ment decisionmaking.Poverty reduction strategies seek to pro-mote stronger citizen voice,with an effec-tive link to public spending.But they alsoseek to change the relationship betweenrecipients and donors by stressing the recip-ient’s ownership ofthe reform agenda.There are often tradeoffs when one instru-ment is used to achieve multiple goals.Countries preparing the early povertyreduction policy papers (PRSP) faced manychallenges in managing the participatoryprocess and linking their strategy to thebudget,while adhering to tight timetablesfor debt relieffor which a PRSP was a con-dition.Experience in many countries sug-gests that when a government presents anational development strategy,supportedby broad ownership and well-deﬁned sectorpriorities,this contributes in no small mea-sure to attracting broad donor support.Moreover,it also offers a framework to bet-ter align and harmonize donor support.Align aid delivery with service deliveryFor donors that want to align their aiddelivery with service delivery in recipientcountries,this Report has three importantmessages.•First,evaluate interventions and aid pro-jects for impact.More systematic evalua-tions of,say,an intervention’s effects onstudent learning or health status are crit-ical for scaling up in both middle- andlow-income countries.Evaluation linkedto early steps toward rebuilding statecapacity is important in situations wheredonors are working through alternativeservice providers due to conﬂict or statefailure.•Second,to reduce the costs ofaid frag-mentation and to build capacity,workwith other donors to harmonize andalign policies,procedures,and practicesaround the recipient’s own systems.Where country systems are weak,theyneed to be strengthened to meet goodpractice standards,not bypassed andsubstituted with ring-fenced donor sys-tems and procedures.This is crucial foraid effectiveness in low-income coun-tries that receive a substantial part oftheir public resources as foreign aid.Butit is also relevant in middle-incomecountries in sectors where donors areespecially active,as in social protectionin Latin America and elsewhere.•Third,harmonization and realignmentare best done at the country level and bystrengthening the recipient’s existing insti-tutions.In countries with fairly goodexpenditure management and genuineservice reforms—where donors and recip-ients trust each other—budget supportshould be considered a viable tool.Resource pooling can also be effective inscaling up service delivery and reducingtransaction costs in low-income countriesSince 1997 Tanzania has conducted anannual public expenditure review,led by thegovernment with the participation of donorsand a wide range of civil society.A primaryobjective is to review the government’s for-ward expenditure plans in its medium-termexpenditure framework,to discuss the pro-gram with donors,and to conﬁrm the exter-nal ﬁnancing.From its inception the initiativealso had the objective of developing a publicconsultative process to engage a wide rangeof domestic constituencies on the govern-ment’s performance and forward plans.Theworking group overseeing the process is ledby the Ministry of Finance but includes mem-bers from donors and a range of nongovern-mental bodies.Several features of the process showhow donor accountability requirements canbe met in a way that promotes a sustainabledomestic system of accountability:•Not tying the consultations to a singledonor or ﬁnancing instrument.Individualdonors can use the process in their ownmonitoring and review procedures.•Grounding the review process in thedomestic policymaking and budgetarycycle,rather than in donor review pro-cedures that open the possibility fordomestic constituencies to use theprocess increasingly for their own pur-poses of legislative scrutiny,feedback,public comment,and lobbying.•Expanding the scope of the review overtime,from immediate donor concerns—how donor interests have beenaddressed in budget plans or howdonor ﬁnance features in theframework—to broader

that are under stress—for example,dueto past or current conﬂict.573Innovate and evaluateLarge public sector organizations—in bothdonor and recipient countries—focus oninputs and process evaluation rather thanoutputs and outcomes (box 11.5).Theincentive to do this in aid agencies is evenstronger because ofthe broken feedbackloop between taxpayers in the donor coun-try and beneﬁciaries in the recipient country(ﬁgure 11.1).Outcome and impact evalua-tions are seldom built into aid projects.Spe-cial attention is required to counter the ten-dency ofaid agencies to be input-orientedand to increase the share ofinterventionssubject to rigorous impact evaluation.Out-come-oriented international targets,such asthe Millennium Development Goals,canadd to the incentives for aid agencies toovercome their focus on inputs.A major difﬁculty in assessing theimpacts ofany public program is that bene-ﬁciaries are rarely selected randomly.Indeed,most programs are purposely tar-geted to speciﬁc groups or regions.Isolatingthe impacts from the circumstances that ledto participation is then tortuous.Yet notdoing so may produce misleading results.Schemes that select participants randomlyprovide the best opportunities for unbiasedimpact evaluation.An example is the Edu-cation,Health,and Nutrition Program ofMexico (Progresa),a large governmenttransfer program (see spotlight).Strongevidence ofits high impact led to an expan-sion ofthe program in Mexico and theadoption ofsimilar programs elsewhere.Another example is the secondary schoolvoucher program in Colombia,whichassigned beneﬁciaries by lottery,making itfeasible to compare those receiving vouch-ers with those who did not.574A randomlyassigned pilot program for treating intesti-nal worms in Kenyan schoolchildren hasbeen similarly evaluated.575In many operational settings,however,randomization cannot be applied,andother methods must be found to create amatched comparison.Even when data onbeneﬁciaries before and after implementa-tion exist,determining the real effects ofaprogram or policy change requires data onmatched comparison groups to get at thecounterfactual ofwhat would have hap-pened without the policy.For someschemes that do not have baseline data,it ispossible to construct an adequate controlgroup from the postintervention data.Butbaseline data are needed for others,such asrural roads with far-reaching impacts onpoverty,health,and education outcomes.576Not every program can be evaluated forimpact,so governments and donors shouldselect programs for evaluation carefully,focusing on areas where new knowledge isneeded.Interventions rolled out in phasesbecause ofbudget and other constraintsoffer good opportunities for effectiveimpact evaluation.Similarly,when a pilot isrequired before a large-scale rollout,animpact evaluation will generate importantinformation for decisionmakers.Harmonizing donor support around recipient systemsHarmonizing is easier where the recipienthas a well-functioning national develop-ment strategy and budget process that canserve as the common framework.But theseare not prerequisites—for even in their212WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004The disruption in the feedback loopbetween donor country taxpayers andrecipient beneﬁciaries,combined with thecomplexity of measuring performance,results in a focus on inputs in aid agencies.Budgets,contracts,and expenditures onprojects are easier to monitor and assignthan are the outputs and impacts that theaid projects produce.Elected policymakers in donor countriesimpose administrative procedures on aidagencies to restrict their discretionary deci-sionmaking.In addition,bureaucracies tendto develop their own procedures,whichincreases the complexity.In this sense aidagencies are like any other large public orga-nization.Extensive consultations with non-governmental organizations diffuse the riskof political pressure in donor countries—andcomplex tender and contract proceduresdefuse criticism by aid service suppliers.Withsuch an incentive structure,aid agencies allo-cate comparatively few resources to verifythe results of aid projects or to mainstreamrigorous impact evaluation.The input biasand the need to handle political problems orpressures tilt stafﬁng toward generalists andadministrators.Yet most aid projects include a formalevaluation requirement.Processevaluations—such as audits,monitoring,and veriﬁcations that the intended actiontook place—are often conducted well.Out-come evaluations are seldom built in,and ifdone at all are contracted later toconsultants.If evaluations are a small part ofthese consultants’foreign aid market,theyalso tend toward input bias and may avoidrevealing results that can affect their mainmarket.Consultants may not consciouslymisreport;the market pressure is usuallymore subtle.Contractors who work mainlyfor aid agencies often become generaliststhemselves.Source:Martens and others (2002).BOX 11.5Why aid agencies focus on inputs23_WDR_Ch11.qxd  8/14/03  10:35 AM  Page 212(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Donors and service reform213absence harmonization and pooling ofaidcan offer signiﬁcant beneﬁts and reducetransaction costs.577In low-income coun-tries coming out ofconﬂict or in situationsofvery weak public institutions,a “budgetwithin the budget”—with separate account-ability mechanisms for donors—or an inde-pendent service agency funded by donors,or a consortium ofnongovernmentalproviders chosen jointly through a transpar-ent process can be relevant options.578Botharrangements can be linked to public sectorreform efforts,which emerge over time.Butto be effective,harmonization requires aradical realignment ofprocedures and oper-ational policies in donor agencies,as thehealth project in Bolivia shows (box 11.6).For donor-ﬁnanced services shiftingresponsibility—and hence accountability—toward the recipient would reduce duplica-tion,waste,and transaction costs.It wouldalso keep donors from crowding into a fewfashionable sectors—and thus lessen con-cerns about absorptive capacity.And itwould build capacity,improve collectivelearning,and create stronger incentives formonitoring and evaluating impacts andresults.A common refrain is that recipients needto improve their ﬁnancial management andpublic procurement practices before donorscan align their support around the recipi-ent’s systems.But reality is more nuanced.First,donors need to ask whether relying oncountry systems is riskier than the alterna-tive ofring-fencing.Currently,developing-country borrowers must produce 8,000audit reports every year for multilateraldevelopment banks—5,500 ofsuch reportsfor the World Bank.Such a fragmentation ofactivities cannot increase accountability.Second,even ifit is riskier,this needs to beset against the more sustainable beneﬁts ofhelping to build the recipient’s institutionsand systems.Third,donors need to avoidthe trap ofmaking a given level ofcapacity acondition for aligning or pooling aid,whenin many cases the pooling launches effortsthat can get capacity closer to where it needsto be.That said,there will still be cases inwhich donors judge (rather than scientiﬁ-cally determine) that it would be inappro-priate to pool,given the ﬁduciary risks.Sectorwide approachesSince the mid-1990s many countries haveworked to integrate government and donoractivities within a sector.In the idealapproach,outlined in early documents onsectorwide approaches,the governmentand its partners would agree on a pre-dictable resource envelope and on a policyenvironment consistent with the nationalbudget and economic strategy.579Theywould then agree on how to assignresources within this envelope.Proceduresfor disbursement would be harmonized,and funds would be pooled.All activitieswould reﬂect a shared view ofthe prioritiesand costs ofactivities.Differences would beresolved by compromises in the design ofprograms,not in the activities undertaken.There would be no detectable differencebetween the approach taken on govern-ment-funded and that taken on donor-funded activities;indeed,that distinctionwould wither away.Sectorwide approaches have been estab-lished in several sectors in many low-income countries—health,education,agri-culture,transport,energy,and water.580Efforts so far are only partial realizations ofthe ideal.To some extent determiningwhat constitutes a sectorwide approach isstill an arbitrary decision.There has beenprogress toward pooling funds in recentIn Bolivia three donors in the health sectoragreed to coﬁnance construction of a build-ing.But the fact that each donor had its ownprocurement procedures made it difﬁcult toﬁnd a common approach.The donors couldnot pool their contribution in a commonfund because the agencies’rules prohibitedchanneling money to another agency.Noneof the agencies could accept the proceduresof the others,and two of the agencies wereunwilling to adopt Bolivian rules.A thematic approach was consideredﬁrst.One donor would pay for the design,another the construction works,and thethird would contribute paint,air condition-ing,electrical apparatus,and lavatories.Then,for practical and administrative rea-sons and to avoid blaming the other agen-cies if something went wrong,it wassuggested that each donor would pay forparticular ﬂoors,procuring the materialsand hiring builders according to its ownstandards and procedures.The idea wasthat one donor agency would ﬁnish the ﬁrsttwo ﬂoors,after which the second wouldbuild the third ﬂoor,and the third would ﬁn-ish the building.After long debates,one of the donorswithdrew from the project.Of the remain-ing two,the one contributing the smalleramount accepted the rules of the donorputting up the bulk of the funds.Only onecontractor would be hired,not the threepreviously envisaged,and just one engineerwould supervise construction.One agencywould oversee the entire process.Theprocess took two years,and the foundationstone has yet to be laid.Source:World Bank

years,however.For the 24 programs trackedby the Strategic Partnership with Africa in2002,41 percent ofassistance came throughprojects (down from 56 percent two yearsearlier),13 percent through NGOs,11 per-cent as common basket,and 35 percent asbudget support.In Ghana’s health programthe pooling arrangements started with “onedonor and minimal funding”but laterreached 40 percent ofprogram resources.581Preparing and implementing sectorwideapproaches can be a long,drawn-outprocess.It can also weaken rather thanstrengthen the recipient’s compact betweenits policymakers and provider organizationsby taking the sector out ofthe domesticdecisionmaking process,particularly thebudgetary process,ﬁnancial managementand public procurement.582Four lessonshave emerged from sectorwide approaches:•An institutional analysis ofthe sector isrecommended beforehand,includingthe sector’s relation to the rest ofthepublic sector.•Ifthe capacity constraint is in the leadministry rather than the country,newpersonnel can sometimes be foundquickly,as in the Ugandan educationand health sectors.583•Procedures need to be designed withcapacity limitations in mind,particu-larly at decentralized levels.This willoften involve encouraging public trans-parency and bottom-up monitoring tobolster simple but rigorously enforcedupward-reporting requirements.Pro-curement procedures—often a majordifﬁculty—need to balance rigor withsimplicity.•Capacity constraints are not a reason todelay a sectorwide approach.Few coun-tries achieve the ideal,but most can ben-eﬁt from some aspects ofthe process.Assessments ofsectorwide approacheshave reached mixed ﬁndings.Ratings by theStrategic Partnership with Africa in 2002show an average implementation rating forprograms ofbetween 0.42 and 0.58,depend-ing on the sector (on a scale where 0 is poor,0.33 fair,0.66 good,and 1 very good).But itis possible that these relatively poor ratingsalso reﬂect the ambitious agenda for sector-wide approaches.A tentative conclusion isthat sectorwide approaches are an importantpart ofa poverty reduction strategy,not analternative,and the full beneﬁts will not berealized until ﬁnancing mechanisms becomemore ﬂexible.Budget supportThe focus on budget support was sharp-ened by the debt relieffor heavily indebtedpoor countries,allocating reliefto prioritysectors through the recipient’s budget.Bud-get support restores the compact betweenpolicymakers and providers.It allows con-testability in public spending.And itreduces the costs from fragmentation andseparate project implementation units.Pro-viding funds to the general budget alsooffers a better framework for discussingintersectoral allocations.Advocates ofmorefunding to one sector have to show that thesector has higher returns than others at themargin.584Iffunds go to sectors thatdemonstrably reduce poverty—directly orindirectly—donors should be ﬂexible aboutbudget allocations.Budget support,like basket funding for asectorwide approach,raises questions ofﬁduciary risk.But there is no clear evidencethat the risk is greater for budget supportthan for project aid.585Needed are transpar-ent systems for procurement and publicinformation to ensure that the movementoffunds through the system can be publiclyobserved and that charges paid for servicesare clearly deﬁned.Donors can contributebest by promoting these systems in therecipient country.The Utstein group ofdonors—the United Kingdom,the Nether-lands,Norway,and Germany—has beendeveloping monitoring arrangements alongthese lines.The European Union links partofits budget support to performance,usinga small set ofindicators (box 11.7).What does all this suggest? That aid willwork best where it is provided ﬂexibly torecipients with sound overall strategies andwell-designed sectoral programs.Flexibleaid can catalyze processes within govern-ments to produce sound strategies,rationalspending programs,and effective services.214WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 200423_WDR_Ch11.qxd  8/14/03  10:36 AM  Page 214(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Donors and service reform215Knowledge transfersDonor competition for new ideas can begood for the recipient.It can also createconfusion,particularly in low-incomecountries that have weak capacity.Onesolution is to pool knowledge transfersand joint analytical work at the countrylevel,including impact evaluations ofinterventions and programs.All analyticalwork supported by donors should drawon in-country capacity,including univer-sities,government,and the private sector(box 11.8).Poor institutions—post-conﬂict and “failed”statesIn poor institutional environments—as inpost-conﬂict countries or “failed”states—donors may not be able to rely on conven-tional channels ofservice provision becausepolicymakers and providers lack the capac-ity or the intent to use resources well.586Whatever the short-term or even medium-term delivery vehicle,aid should contributein the longer term to rebuilding an effectiveservice delivery system and public sector.The temptation to avoid the government isunderstandable.But without some clearand shared donor strategy for rebuilding aresponsive and effective state,the prolifera-tion ofnongovernmental and community-based organizations—and self-help andsocial fund initiatives—will lack breadth ofimpact and sustainability.Civil societyorganizations cannot design national poli-cies or standards.Nor can they substitute inthe long term for the citizen-policymakerrelationship.The options for donors range fromselectively supporting existing programs,such as immunization programs operatedby the government or private providers,toestablishing an independent service author-ity with a temporary mandate to deliver orregulate basic services.587In between areself-help projects and social funds.An inde-pendent service authority and a social fundare ways to deliver services in difﬁcult cir-cumstances,perhaps by wholesaling to alocal consortium ofNGOs,religious orga-nizations,and private ﬁrms.Such organiza-tions require institutional autonomy toensure high standards ofaccountabilitydirectly to donors.To deliver on such stan-dards,hiring may have to be outside thepublic sector.Again,donors should coordi-nate and pool their support to reduce wasteand duplication,ﬁnancing both recurrentand capital expenditures.Donors face the challenge ofﬁnding abalance between short- to medium-terminstitutional failures and the long-term cre-ation ofan effective state that can deliver onits public responsibilities.Donors havesought to address short-term service needsthrough national and international NGOs,social funds,United Nations agencies,or acombination ofthese providers.Whatneeds to be given equal emphasis is theidentiﬁcation ofcountry-speciﬁc paths forstrengthening capacity and reduction inpatronage and corruption.Nongovernmen-tal channels for service delivery can thusplay a very important role but should beseen as a transitional strategy to strengthenstate capacity in the long term.Even in the weakest states donors anddomestic stakeholders would beneﬁt fromThe European Commission is explicitly linkingpart of its budget support to performance.The amount to be disbursed is based onprogress in social service delivery,notablyhealth and education,and in public expendi-ture management.Progress is measured by asmall number of performance indicatorsagreed to by the recipient and the EuropeanCommission.Indicators are typically drawnfrom the recipient’s poverty reduction strat-egy.For the ﬁrst set of countries,the most fre-quently used indicators are:•Planned and actual expenditures in thesocial sectors.•Differences in unit costs of key inputsbetween the public sector and the market.•Use of primary and antenatal health careservices.•Immunization rates.•Births assisted by medical personnel.•Enrollment rates for boys and girls.•Cost of primary education (private andpublic).After a joint evaluation by governmentand donors,a score is calculated for eachindicator:one point if the agreed objectiveis attained,half a point if there is evidenceof “considerable positive development,”and zero if there is no progress.The budgetsupport provided is the maximum amountavailable multiplied by the (unweighted)average performance score (ranging fromzero to one).The approach is not mechani-cal but also takes into account externalfactors.The performance-based system high-lights the quality of data.According to theEuropean Commission,the system is not anend but a means:getting policymakers andthe public in developing countries to paymore attention to results than to declara-tions of intentions and conditions set bydonors.So far,30 percent of the European Com-mission’s budget support is linked to perfor-mance indicators.This is deliberate,motivated by the desire to introduce a newapproach gradually and to balance perfor-mance rewards and the recipient’s need forpredictable budget ﬁnance.Source:European Commission.BOX

pooling efforts for a better results.Har-monization ofaid may not be feasiblethrough budget support,but agreement ona common framework and implementationarrangements for service delivery will helpavoid too heavy a burden on limited domes-tic capacity.Further,it is important to sharelessons and to recognize that aid may be lesseffective when modalities that work in goodpolicy environments are transferred toother situations.The ﬂexibility of“eightsizes ﬁt all”includes a strong emphasis oncountry context.Why reforming aid is so difﬁcultThe unintended negative effects ofdonorbehavior are not a recent discovery.WorldDevelopment Report 1990: Poverty(WorldBank (1990)) discussed the role ofaid inpoverty reduction,drawing attention tomany similar problems.Why has there notbeen more reform? Why,for instance,aredonors so reluctant to channel aid as part ofthe recipient’s budget? Simplifying donor policies,procedures,and practices and directing aid ﬂexiblythrough sectorwide approaches or the bud-get process would lower the high transac-tion costs in low-income countries andallow recipients to pursue their objectivesmore efﬁciently.That could be done ifdonors were driven solely by the motive toreduce poverty—and ifrecipients were per-ceived to be committed to the same goal.But the world is more complex.Incentivesin aid agencies and the political economy ofaid in donor countries work against this:•Aid agencies want to be able to identifytheir own contributions,often throughdistinct “projects,”to facilitate feedbackto taxpayers and sustain political sup-port for aid ﬂows.A new hospital is eas-ier to showcase than the outcome ofpol-icy reform or budget support.•Aid agencies,facing disbursement pres-sures,need to show quick results to tax-payers—and NGOs,to their contribu-tors.This is easier when donors are incharge ofinterventions.•Politicians and policymakers in donorcountries cannot dismiss the interestgroups that support them,groups thatmay place a high priority on funding like-minded groups in developing countries.•Many donors limit the market for aidservices and supplies to their ownnationals (tied aid).Foreign aid sustainsa large consultancy industry in OECDcountries—estimated at $4 billion a yearfor Sub-Saharan Africa,or 30 percent ofaid to the continent.216WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2004To improve access to infrastructure services forpoor people,several donors have pooled fundsto augment and disseminate knowledge oninfrastructure services.These facilities,adminis-tered by the World Bank,provide a source ofknowledge and advice that is “ﬁre-walled”fromthe Bank’s lending activities.Donors in the poolare Canada,Japan,the Netherlands,Sweden,Switzerland,the United Kingdom,and theUnited Nations Development Programme.The Energy Sector Management AdvisoryProgram,a global technical assistance program,focuses on energy in economic development,with the objectives of contributing to povertyalleviation and economic development,improv-ing living conditions,and preserving the envi-ronment.It focuses on:•Market-oriented energy sector reform andrestructuring•Access to efﬁcient and affordable energy•Environmentally sustainable energy produc-tion,transportation,distribution,and use.The Water and Sanitation Program assistscentral governments,municipal agencies,localauthorities,NGOs,community organizations,pri-vate service providers,and external agencies inhelping poor people gain sustained access tobetter water and sanitation services.It focuseson:•Policy,strategy,and institutional reform advi-sory services•Innovative solutions to problems,includingpilot and demonstration projects•Strategically selected investment support ser-vices,including networking and knowledgesharing.With its strong ﬁeld presence in Africa,South and East Asia,and the Andes,theprogram has a well-established network of sec-tor specialists who can respond quickly to thechanging demands of clients.The Public-Private Infrastructure AdvisoryFacilityis a technical assistance facility helpingdeveloping countries to improve theirinfrastructure through private sectorinvolvement.It pursues its mission through:•Technical assistance to governments onstrategies for tapping the full potential of pri-vate involvement in infrastructure•Identifying,disseminating,and promotingbest practices related to private involvementin infrastructure.Source:World Bank staff.BOX 11.8Pooling knowledge transfers23_WDR_Ch11.qxd  8/14/03  10:37 AM  Page 216(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Donors and service reform217•Preferences for spending differ amongdonors and between donors and recipi-ents.Donors often are most comfortablewith service delivery systems ofthe typeoperating in their own country.Forinstance,British and Nordic advisers arefamiliar with a clinic-based free healthservice and so prefer to support thosesystems in low-income countries too.•Fiduciary concerns and incentives in aidagencies cause donors to focus on moni-toring inputs and processes.Again,themonitoring is easier in project aid wherethe donor controls the design and imple-mentation ofeach intervention.•Donors may want to persuade aid recipi-ents ofthe value ofa different approachthrough a pilot project,to show success.•Bilateral donors distribute their aid bud-gets across a large number ofrecipientsand sectors,to increase the visibility oftheir programs or to leverage or rewarddiplomatic support from recipientnations.588More specialization amongsectors or recipients,however efﬁcient,could expose a donor to charges that it isneglecting,say,a global health crisis or aregional humanitarian crisis.Such con-siderations help explain why the typicalbilateral donor in 2000 provided ofﬁcialdevelopment aid (ODA) to about 115independent nations.Even omittingrecipients that received less than$100,000,the mean number ofODArecipients for each ofthe 22 major bilat-eral donors was 95.These multiple objectives create incen-tives for donors to ﬁnance and directly con-trol their aid interventions.That createsproblems for recipient countries:donorsoften do not know (or don’t care) whatother donors and the recipient are doing,which results in duplication,waste,andgaps in services.589These days donors tendto favor social sector projects over otherpublic expenditures.Ifthey do not payattention to what the others are doing,theymay concentrate too much on higher-prior-ity sectors,leaving sectors with a lower pri-ority,such as rural roads in Zambia,shortoffunds.Or there may be gaps in the prior-ity areas simply because nobody is lookingat the big picture.But priorities amongdonors vary,and their approaches changeover time.590So there is some scope—andhope—for improvement.23_WDR_Ch11.qxd  8/14/03  10:37 AM  Page 217(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

capita was about $160 averaged over the 1990s and mortality 190 in2000.These two countries fall very close to the cross-countryregression line between income and mortality.These data on childmortality are from UNICEF (2002).124.See in particular:Barro (1991),Bhargava and others(2001),Bils and Klenow (2000),Pritchett and Summers (1996),andSavedoffand Schultz (2000).125.Dollar amounts in this paragraph are in 2001 U.S.dollarsand refer to averages for the 1990s.126.Dollar amounts are in 2001 U.S.dollars.127.Moreover,these cross-national estimates likely overstatethe association between income and outcomes as they do not takeinto account speciﬁc country attributes.The growth rates discussedhere are at best underestimates ofthose necessary.128.Dollar amounts in this list are expressed in 1995 U.S.dol-lars.129.Between 1980 and 2000 annual average growth ofGDP percapita was:Ethiopia –0.55 percent;Malawi 0.25 percent;Thailand0.046 percent;Peru –0.41 percent;Mexico 0.74 percent;Jordan–0.57 percent;Côte d’Ivoire –0.017 percent;Haiti –0.025 percent(based on World Development Indicators database).130.Hammer,Nabi,and Cercone (1995).131.van der Berg and Burger (2003).132.Duﬂo (2001).Filmer,Hammer,and Pritchett (2000) dis-cuss the within-country evidence further.133.The result holds for other outcomes as well.For example,the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’sProgram for International Student Assessmentfound that morespending on education was associated with better test results in asample oflargely upper income countries (Organization for Eco-nomic Cooperation and Development (2001)).However,the asso-ciation becomes almost zero (and insigniﬁcant from it) once GDPper capita is controlled for.134.Filmer and Pritchett (1999b).135.Bidani and Ravallion (1997) and Wagstaff(2002).136.Gupta,Verhoeven,and Tiongson (2002).137.Rajkumar and Swaroop (2002);Gupta,Verhoeven,andTiongson (2002) ﬁnd corruption to be important,but Jayasuriyaand Wodon (2002) do not.138.For example,the number ofcountries,and country cover-age,in cross-national studies ofspending and mortality are:98 inFilmer and Pritchett (1999b);22 in Anand and Ravallion (1993);76and 56 in Jayasuriya and Wodon (2002);22 in Gupta,Verhoeven,and Tiongson (2002);32 in Gupta,Verhoeven,and Tiongson(forthcoming);116 in Gupta,Davoodi,and Tiongson (2002);32 inWagstaff(2002);35 in Bidani and Ravallion (1997).There is a par-allel,although somewhat less developed literature on educationoutcomes and spending:for example,Wößmann (2003);Gupta,Verhoeven,and Tiongson (2002).139.This discussion is based on Lieberman (2003).140.Such expenditure incidence studies ofhealth and educa-tion spending provide a valuable description,but they cannot tellthe full story.First,they provide a cross-sectional snapshot that isnot the same as who would beneﬁt from the marginal resourcesdevoted to the sector.Second,while the data are often based on thebest available they are limited—especially when it comes to assess-ing the costs ofeach unit ofthe service provided.Third,the studiesimplicitly assume that the value ofthe expenditure is equal acrossall users.Fourth,they do not include the incidence ofraisingfunds—that is,a fairly regressive pattern ofspending might still bepro-poor ifit is ﬁnanced through a very progressive tax system.Fifth,it is hard to know what a “good”allocation is without com-paring it to other types ofsocial spending.141.Reinikka and Svensson (2001).142.Foster (1990).143.World Bank (1994a).144.Filmer,Hammer,and Pritchett (2000).145.Gertler and Molyneaux (1995).146.Sixty-six percent is the amount recommended by Bruns,Mingat,and Rakatomalala (2003) based on a review ofcountriesthat have made substantial progress toward universal completion.147.Bruns,Mingat,and Rakatomalala (2003).148.Devarajan,Miller,and Swanson (2002) use a similarapproach to costing the ﬁrst Millennium Development Goal,halv-ing income poverty between 1990 and 2015.149.Devarajan,Miller,and Swanson (2002) avoid some ofthedouble counting by calculating the cost ofthe health,education,and environmental goals independently ofthe income poverty goaland then calculating the cost ofthe income poverty goal indepen-dently ofall the others.150.This account is drawn from Paul (2002).151.Drawn from Community Driven Development (2002).152.This

sense.225.Goetz and Jenkins (2002) and Schedler (1999).The manymeanings given to accountability—an overused term—often blur.So,“vertical”accountability (citizens individually or collectivelyholding the state to account,as in elections) is sometimes distin-guished from “horizontal”accountability withingovernment (aminister or senior civil servant formally holding another civil ser-vant accountable).Authoritarian states may manifest horizontalaccountability,but not offer much vertical accountability.226.Shah (2003a);also see

class size,mostly from nonexperi-mental data.This is a problem because ifclass size is consciouslychosen in ways that cause a correlation between performance andclass size—say,by school administrators who make classes with dis-ruptive children (who would cause low performance) smaller (sothe teacher can better handle the situation) or by students,who,given choice within a school will choose teachers with better repu-tations—then the observed,nonexperimental data might show anegative or zero correlation between class size and performanceeven though a truly exogenous shift in class size would improve per-formance.There is evidence ofa reasonably large effect ofclass sizefrom a randomized experiment in Tennessee,and “quasi-experi-mental”evidence from Israel (Angrist and Lavy (1999),SouthAfrica (Case and Deaton (1999),and Bolivia (Urquiola (2001).Butcritics ofthis evidence argue that reported results are “hit andmiss”—in that,ifclass size effects are measured in two subjects inthree grades,there are class size effects in some grades and subjectsand not others—with no particular pattern;that the literature issubject to enormous “publication bias”in that statistically signiﬁ-cant results are much more likely to be written up and published,even ifthey are in fact rare;and that randomized experiments inwhich the teachers know the purpose ofthe experiment are not infact a clean test,as teachers will attempt to perform well to justifysmaller class sizes (Hoxby 2000).Hanushek (2002) continues toemphasize the huge literature in which there is a general lack ofacorrelation—with “better”studies less likely to ﬁnd effects—andpoints to the “big picture”evidence unlikely to be affected by the“endogeneity arguments”—the time series in the United States andOECD countries in which class sizes have fallen substantially whilescores have stagnated,and the lack ofcross-national evidence.Hoxby (2000) produces quasi-experimental evidence from theUnited States (Vermont) showing no class size effects and arguesher results are more typical and representative than others.328.Vegas (2002).329.Banerjee and others (2003).330.Crouch and Healey (1997).331.Sillers (2002).332.For instance,empirical studies that run standard wage (orearnings) regressions with a few characteristics (age,gender,educa-tion) and include a dummy variable (or interaction terms) forteachers provide a purely statistical answer to the question,“Doesthe wage regression over- or underpredict wages (or earnings) ofteachers?”But even this answer is without a clear interpretation andthese studies do not,in themselves,answer the question,“Are teach-ers underpaid?’(Psacharopoulos,Valenzuela,and Arends (1996);Liang (1999);Filmer (2002);Vegas,Pritchett,and Experton (1999).In some situations in which these regressions suggested that teach-ers were “underpaid”the annual output ofteachers collegesexceeded available positions by several-fold (suggesting teacher paywas adequate),while in others where the regressions suggestedteachers were “overpaid”there were few new teachers and wageswere being increased (suggesting teacher pay was inadequate).333.Murnane and Cohen (1986).334.Eskeland and Filmer (2002).335.King,James,and Suriyadi (1996) and Pritchett and Filmer(1999).336.Birdsall and Orivel (1996).337.Case (2001).338.See

249This year’s edition presents comparative socioeco-nomic data for more than 134 economies in sixtables.An additional table provides data on basicindicators for 74 economies with sparse data or with popula-tions ofless than 1.5 million.Data are for the most recentyear available and,for some indicators,an earlier year is pro-vided for comparison purposes.The ﬁrst two tables present data on the size ofeconomiesand several indicators on non-income poverty that areincluded in the Millennium Development Goals.Four addi-tional tables cover data on special topics related to the mainWDR themes on health,education,service delivery,and for-eign aid.The indicators presented here are a selection from morethan 800 included in World Development Indicators 2003.Pub-lished annually,World Development Indicators reﬂects a com-prehensive view ofthe development process.Its openingchapter reports on the Millennium Development Goals whichgrew out ofagreements and resolutions ofworld conferencesorganized by the United Nations (UN) in the past decade,andreafﬁrmed at the Millennium Summit in September 2000 bymember countries ofthe UN.The other ﬁve main sectionsrecognize the contribution ofa wide range offactors:humancapital development,environmental sustainability,macroeco-nomic performance,private sector development,and theglobal links that inﬂuence the external environment for devel-opment.World Development Indicators is complemented by aseparately published database that gives access to over 1,000data tables and 800 time-series indicators for 225 economiesand regions.This database is available through an electronicsubscription (WDI Online) or as a CD-ROM.Data sources and methodologySocioeconomic and environmental data presented here aredrawn from several sources:primary data collected by theWorld Bank,member country statistical publications,research institutes,and international organizations such asthe United Nations and its specialized agencies,the Interna-tional Monetary Fund (IMF),and the Organisation for Eco-nomic Co-operation and Development (OECD).Althoughinternational standards ofcoverage,deﬁnition,and classiﬁ-cation apply to most statistics reported by countries andinternational agencies,there are inevitably differences intimeliness and reliability arising from differences in thecapabilities and resources devoted to basic data collectionand compilation.For some topics,competing sources ofdatarequire review by World Bank staffto ensure that the mostreliable data available are presented.In some instances,where available data are deemed too weak to provide reliablemeasures oflevels and trends or do not adequately adhere tointernational standards,the data are not shown.The data presented are generally consistent with those inWorld Development Indicators 2003.However,data have beenrevised and updated wherever new information has becomeavailable.Differences may also reﬂect revisions to historicalseries and changes in methodology.Thus data ofdifferentvintages may be published in different editions ofWorldBank publications.Readers are advised not to compile dataseries from different publications or different editions ofthesame publication.Consistent time-series data are available onWorld Development Indicators 2003 CD-ROM and throughWDI Online.All dollar ﬁgures are in current U.S.dollars unless other-wise stated.The various methods used to convert fromnational currency ﬁgures are described in the TechnicalNotes.Because the World Bank’s primary business is providinglending and policy advice to its low- and middle-incomemembers,the issues covered in these tables focus mainly onthese economies.Where available,information on the high-income economies is also provided for comparison.Readersmay wish to refer to national statistical publications and pub-lications ofthe OECD and the European Union for moreinformation on the high-income economies.Introduction to Selected WorldDevelopment Indicators27_WDR_pgs 249-250.qxd  8/14/03  11:30 AM  Page 249(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Classiﬁcation of economies and summary measuresThe summary measures at the bottom ofeach tableinclude economies classiﬁed by income per capita and byregion.GNI per capita is used to determine the followingincome classiﬁcations:low-income,$735 or less in 2002;middle-income,$736 to $9,075;and high-income,$9,076and above.A further division at GNI per capita $2,935 ismade between lower-middle-income and upper-middle-income economies.See the table on classiﬁcation ofeconomies in this volume for a list ofeconomies in eachgroup (including those with populations ofless than 1.5million).Summary measures are either totals (indicated by tifthe aggregates include estimates for missing data and non-reporting countries,or by an s for simple sums ofthe dataavailable),weighted averages (w),or median values (m)calculated for groups ofeconomies.Data for the countriesexcluded from the main tables (those presented in Table 7)have been included in the summary measures,where dataare available,or by assuming that they follow the trend ofreporting countries.This gives a more consistent aggre-gated measure by standardizing country coverage for eachperiod shown.Where missing information accounts for athird or more ofthe overall estimate,however,the groupmeasure is reported as not available.The Technical Notesprovides further information on aggregation methods.Weights used to construct the aggregates are listed in thetechnical notes for each table.From time to time an economy’s classiﬁcation is revisedbecause ofchanges in the above cutoffvalues or in the econ-omy’s measured level ofGNI per capita.When such changesoccur,aggregates based on those classiﬁcations are recalcu-lated for the past period so that a consistent time series ismaintained.Terminology and country coverageThe term country does not imply political independence butmay refer to any territory for which authorities report sepa-rate social or economic statistics.Data are shown foreconomies as they were constituted in 2002,and historicaldata are revised to reﬂect current political arrangements.Throughout the tables,exceptions are noted.Technical notesBecause data quality and intercountry comparisons are oftenproblematic,readers are encouraged to consult the Technicalnotes,the table on Classiﬁcation ofeconomies by region andincome,and the footnotes to the tables.For more extensivedocumentation see World Development Indicators 2003.Readers may ﬁnd more information on the WDI 2003,and orders can be made online,by phone,or fax as follows:For more information and to order online:http://www.worldbank.org/data/wdi2003/index.htmTo order by phoneor fax:1-800-645-7247or 703-661-1580;Fax 703-661-1501To order by mail:The World Bank,P.O.Box 960,Herndon,VA 20172-0960,U.S.A.250WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 200427_WDR_pgs 249-250.qxd  8/14/03  11:30 AM  Page 250(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Technical notesThese technical notes discuss the sources and methods usedto compile the indicators included in this edition ofSelectedWorld Development Indicators.The notes follow the orderin which the indicators appear in the tables.SourcesThe data published in the Selected World DevelopmentIndicators are taken from World Development Indicators2003.Where possible,however,revisions reported since theclosing date ofthat edition have been incorporated.In addi-tion,newly released estimates ofpopulation and grossnational income (GNI) per capita for 2002 are included intable 1.The World Bank draws on a variety ofsources for the sta-tistics published in the World Development Indicators.Data onexternal debt are reported directly to the World Bank bydeveloping member countries through the Debtor ReportingSystem.Other data are drawn mainly from the United Nationsand its specialized agencies,from the International MonetaryFund (IMF),and from country reports to the World Bank.Bank staffestimates are also used to improve currentness orconsistency.For most countries,national accounts estimatesare obtained from member governments through World Bankeconomic missions.In some instances these are adjusted bystaffto ensure conformity with international deﬁnitions andconcepts.Most social data from national sources are drawnfrom regular administrative ﬁles,special surveys,or periodiccensuses.For more detailed notes about the data,please refer to theWorld Bank’s World Development Indicators 2003.Data consistency and reliability Considerable effort has been made to standardize the data,but full comparability cannot be assured,and care must betaken in interpreting the indicators.Many factors affect dataavailability,comparability,and reliability:statistical systemsin many developing economies are still weak;statisticalmethods,coverage,practices,and deﬁnitions differ widely;and cross-country and intertemporal comparisons involvecomplex technical and conceptual problems that cannot beunequivocally resolved.Data coverage may not be completefor economies experiencing problems,such as those derivingfrom internal or external conﬂicts,affecting the collectingand reporting ofdata.For these reasons,although the dataare drawn from the sources thought to be most authorita-tive,they should be construed only as indicating trends andcharacterizing major differences among economies ratherthan offering precise quantitative measures ofthose differ-ences.Also,national statistical agencies tend to revise theirhistorical data,particularly for recent years.Thus,data ofdifferent vintages may be published in different editions ofWorld Bank publications.Readers are advised not to com-pile such data from different editions.Consistent time seriesare available from the World Development Indicators 2003CD-ROM.Ratios and growth rates For ease ofreference,the tables usually show ratios and ratesofgrowth rather than the simple underlying values.Valuesin their original form are available from the World Develop-ment Indicators 2003 CD-ROM.Unless otherwise noted,growth rates are computed using the least-squares regressionmethod (see Statistical methodsbelow).Because this methodtakes into account all available observations during a period,the resulting growth rates reﬂect general trends that are notunduly inﬂuenced by exceptional values.To exclude theeffects ofinﬂation,constant price economic indicators areused in calculating growth rates.Data in italics are for a yearor period other than that speciﬁed in the column heading—up to two years before or after for economic indicators andup to three years for social indicators,because the latter tendto be collected less regularly and change less dramaticallyover short periods.Constant price series An economy’s growth is measured by the increase in valueadded produced by the individuals and enterprises operatingin that economy.Thus,measuring real growth requires esti-mates ofGDP and its components valued in constant prices.The World Bank collects constant price national accountsseries in national currencies and recorded in the country’soriginal base year.To obtain comparable series ofconstantprice data,it rescales GDP and value added by industrial ori-gin to a common reference year,currently 1995.This processgives rise to a discrepancy between the rescaled GDP and thesum ofthe rescaled components.Because allocating the dis-crepancy would give rise to distortions in the growth rate,itis left unallocated.Summary measures The summary measures for regions and income groups,pre-sented at the end ofmost tables,are calculated by simpleaddition when they are expressed in levels.Aggregate growthrates and ratios are usually computed as weighted averages.The summary measures for social indicators are weighted bypopulation or subgroups ofpopulation,except for infantmortality,which is weighted by the number ofbirths.See thenotes on speciﬁc indicators for more information.For summary measures that cover many years,calcula-tions are based on a uniform group ofeconomies so that thecomposition ofthe aggregate does not change over time.Group measures are compiled only ifthe data available for agiven year account for at least two-thirds ofthe full group,as264WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 200429_WDR_pgs 264-272.qxd  8/14/03  4:13 PM  Page

Selected World Development Indicators265deﬁned for the 1995 benchmark year.As long as this crite-rion is met,economies for which data are missing areassumed to behave like those that provide estimates.Readersshould keep in mind that the summary measures are esti-mates ofrepresentative aggregates for each topic and thatnothing meaningful can be deduced about behavior at thecountry level by working back from group indicators.Inaddition,the estimation process may result in discrepanciesbetween subgroup and overall totals.Table 1.Size ofthe economyPopulationis based on the de facto deﬁnition ofpopulation,which counts all residents regardless oflegal status or citi-zenship—except for refugees not permanently settled in thecountry ofasylum,who are generally considered part ofthepopulation oftheir country oforigin.The values shown aremidyear estimates for 2002.Population estimates are usuallybased on national censuses,but the frequency and quality ofthese vary by country.Errors and undercounting occur evenin high-income countries;in developing countries sucherrors may be substantial because oflimits in the transport,communications,and other resources required to conduct afull census.Intercensal estimates are usually interpolation orextrapolations based on demographic models.Surface areais a country’s total area,including areasunder inland bodies ofwater and some coastal waterways.Population densityis midyear population divided byland area in square kilometers.Land area is a country’s totalarea excluding areas under inland bodies ofwater andcoastal waterways.Gross national income (GNI—formerly gross nationalproduct or GNP),the broadest measure ofnational income,is the sum ofvalue added by all resident producers plus anyproduct taxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuationofoutput plus net receipts ofprimary income (compensa-tion ofemployees and property income) from abroad.Dataare converted from national currency to current U.S.dollarsusing the World Bank Atlas method.This involves using athree-year average ofexchange rates to smooth the effects oftransitory exchange rate ﬂuctuations.(See the section on sta-tistical methods below for further discussion ofthe Atlasmethod).GNI per capitais gross national income divided bymidyear population.GNI per capita in U.S.dollars is con-verted using the World Bank Atlas method.The World Bankuses GNI per capita in U.S.dollars to classify economies foranalytical purposes and to determine borrowing eligibility.PPP Gross national income,which is GNI converted tointernational dollars using purchasing power parity (PPP)conversion factors,is included because nominal exchangerates do not always reﬂect international differences in rela-tive prices.At the PPP rate,one international dollar has thesame purchasing power over domestic GNI that the U.S.dol-lar has over U.S.GNI.PPP rates allow a standard compari-son ofreal price levels between countries,just as conven-tional price indexes allow comparison ofreal values overtime.The PPP conversion factors used here are derived fromprice surveys covering 118 countries conducted by the Inter-national Comparison Programme.For Organisation forEconomic Co-operation and Development countries datacome from the most recent round ofsurveys,completed in2000;the rest are either from the 1996 survey,or data fromthe 1993 or earlier round,which have been extrapolated tothe 1996 benchmark.Estimates for countries not included inthe surveys are derived from statistical models using avail-able data.PPP GNI per capitais PPP GNI divided by midyear pop-ulation.Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita growth isbased on GDP measured in constant prices.GDP is the sumofvalue added by all resident producers plus any producttaxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation ofoutput.Growth in GDP is considered a broad measure ofgrowth ofan economy.GDP in constant prices can be estimated bymeasuring the total quantity ofgoods and services producedin a period,valuing them at an agreed set ofbase year prices,and subtracting the cost ofintermediate inputs,also in con-stant prices.Growth is calculated from constant price GDPdata in local currency.Table 2.Millennium Development Goals:eradicating poverty and improving livesShare ofthe poorest quintile in national consumptionisthe share ofconsumption (or,in some cases,income) thataccrues to the poorest 20 percent ofthe population.Data onpersonal or household income or consumption come fromnationally representative household surveys.The data in thetable refer to different years between 1987 and 2001.Foot-notes to the data indicate whether the ranking are based onper capital income or consumption.Each distribution isbased on percentiles ofpopulation-rather than ofhouse-holds-with households ranked by income or expenditure perperson.Prevalence ofchild malnutritionis the percentage ofchildren under ﬁve whose weight for age is less than minustwo standard deviations from the median for the interna-tional reference population ages 0–59 months.The referencepopulation,adopted by the World Health Organization in1983,is based on children from the United States,who areassumed to be well nourished.Estimates ofchild malnutri-tion are from national survey data.The proportion ofchil-dren who are underweight is the most common indicator ofmalnutrition.Being underweight,even mildly,increases therisk ofdeath and inhibits cognitive development in children.29_WDR_pgs 264-272.qxd  8/14/03  4:13 PM  Page 265(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Moreover,it perpetuates the problem from one generationto the next,as malnourished women are more likely to havelow-birth-weight babies.Primary completion rateis the total number ofstudentssuccessfully completing (or graduating from) the last year ofprimary school in a given year,divided by the total number ofchildren ofofﬁcial graduation age in the population.The pri-mary completion rate reﬂects the primary cycle as nationallydeﬁned,ranging from three to four years ofprimary educa-tion (in a very small number ofcountries) to ﬁve or six years(in most countries) and seven or eight years (in a relativelysmall number ofcountries).For any country it is thereforeconsistent with the gross and net enrollment ratios.Thenumerator may include coverage children who have repeatedone or more grades ofprimary school but are now graduat-ing successfully as well as who entered school early.Thedenominator is the number ofchildren ofofﬁcial graduationage,which could cause the primary completion rate to exceed100 percent.There are other limitations that contribute tocompletion rates exceeding 100 percent,such as the use ofestimates for population,different times ofthe year that theschool and population surveys are conducted,and other dis-crepancies in the numbers used in the calculation Ratio offemale to male enrollments in primary and sec-ondary schoolis the ratio ofthe number offemale studentsenrolled in primary and secondary school to the number ofmale students.Eliminating gender disparities in educationwould help to increase the status and capabilities ofwomen.This indicator is an imperfect measure ofthe relative accessi-bility ofschooling for girls.With a target date of2005,this isthe ﬁrst ofthe targets to fall due.School enrollment data arereported to the UNESCO Institute for Statistics by nationaleducation authorities.Primary education provides childrenwith basic reading,writing,and mathematics skills alongwith an elementary understanding ofsuch subjects as his-tory,geography,natural science,social science,art,andmusic.Secondary education completes the provision ofbasic education that began at the primary level,and aims atlaying foundations for lifelong learning and human develop-ment,by offering more subject-or skill-oriented instructionusing more specialized teachers.Under-ﬁve mortality rateis the probability that a new-born baby will die before reaching age ﬁve,ifsubject to cur-rent age-speciﬁc mortality rates.The probability is expressedas a rate per 1,000.The main sources ofmortality date arevital registration systems and direct or indirect estimatesbased on sample surveys or censuses.To produce harmo-nized estimates ofunder-ﬁve mortality rates that make useofall available information in a transparent way,a method-ology that ﬁts a regression line to the relationship betweenmortality rates and their reference dates using weighted leastsquares was developed and adopted by both UNICEF andthe World Bank.Maternal mortality ratiois the number ofwomen whodie from pregnancy-related causes during pregnancy andchildbirth,per 100,000 live births.The data shown here havebeen collected in various years and adjusted to a common1995 base year.The values are modeled estimates based onan exercise carried out by the World Health Organization(WHO) and United Nations Children’s Fund(UNICEF).Inthis exercise maternal mortality was estimated with a regres-sion model using information on fertility,birth attendants,and HIV prevalence.This cannot be assumed to provide anaccurate estimate ofmaternal mortality in any country inthe table.Births attended by skilled health staffare the percentageofdeliveries attended by personnel trained to give the neces-sary supervision,care,and advice to women during preg-nancy,labor,and the postpartum period,to conduct deliver-ies on their own,and to care for newborns.The share ofbirths attended by skilled health staffis an indicator ofahealth system’s ability to provide adequate care for a preg-nant women.Good antenatal and postnatal care improvesmaternal health and reduces maternal and infant mortality.But data may not reﬂect such improvements because healthinformation system are often weak,material deaths areunderreported,and rates ofmaternal mortality are difﬁcultto measure.Table 3.Expenditures on education and healthPublic expenditure per studentis the public current spend-ing on education divided by the number ofstudents by level,as a percentage ofgross domestic product (GDP) per capita.Data on education are compiled by the UNESCO Institutefor Statistics from ofﬁcial responses to surveys and fromreports provided by education authorities in each country.The data on education spending in the table refer solely topublic spending—government spending on public educa-tion plus subsidies for private education.The data generallyexclude foreign aid for education.They may also excludespending by religious schools,which play a signiﬁcant role inmany developing countries.Data for some countries and forsome years refer to spending by the ministry ofeducationonly (excluding education expenditures by other ministriesand departments and local authorities).Recurrent spending on primary teacher salaries is thetotal amount spent on primary as a percent oftotal recur-rent spending on primary education (the latter includingspending on personnel other than teachers).The data referto the primary education level ofthe education system only.For countries with a ﬁve or six year primary system,the dataare for the ofﬁcial primary cycle.For countries with primarysystems either longer than 6 years,or shorter than 5 years,the data are an estimate ofa hypothetical 6-year equivalentsystem (although based on actual enrollment,teacher,spending data,etc.through grade 6 in that country).The266WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 200429_WDR_pgs 264-272.qxd  8/14/03  4:14 PM  Page 266(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

data are estimates for 2000 based on the latest years forwhich data are available.The data are derived from Bruns,Mingat,and Rakatomalala (2003).Incidence ofeducationexpenditures (lowest and highest quintiles).Incidence ofeducation and health expenditures (lowestand highest quintiles).Average expenditure incidence stud-ies relate household data on the use ofpublic services by dif-ferent quintiles ofthe population to average spending onthose services by the government.Results from these studiesprovide a cross-sectional snapshot ofwho beneﬁts frompublic spending on services.Note that this is not necessarilythe same as who would beneﬁt from the marginal resourcesdevoted to the sector.The data are accompanied by severalcaveats.First,while the data are often based on the bestsources available,they are often limited when it comes toassessing the unit costs ofservices.Second,cross-countrycomparability is hampered by the fact that studies differ inthe detail to which they differentiate average spending:forexample some use a uniform estimate,some estimate sepa-rate unit costs for urban and rural areas,some for differentprovinces,and so on.Third,since the value ofspendingmight differ for different populations (for example spendingon urban dwellers might go much further towards providingquality services than an equal amount spent on people inremote rural areas) the label “expenditure incidence”is dis-tinguished from “beneﬁt incidence”.Fourth,the results donot include the incidence ofraising funds.A fairly regressivepattern ofspending might still be pro-poor ifit is ﬁnancedthrough a very progressive tax system.Fifth,it is hard toknow what a “good”allocation is without comparing it toother types ofsocial spending.Details on the sources forthese results,as well as a disaggregation by types ofexpendi-tures,are available in Filmer (2003) WDR Background Note.Public health expenditureconsists ofrecurrent and cap-ital spending from government (central and local) budgets,external borrowings and grants (including donations frominternational agencies and nongovernmental organizations),and social (or compulsory) health insurance funds.The datain the table are the product ofan effort by the World HealthOrganization (WHO),the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),and the World Bankto collect all available information on health expendituresfrom national and local government budgets,nationalaccounts,household surveys,insurance publications,inter-national donors,and existing tabulations.Private health expenditure includes direct household(out-of-pocket) spending,private insurance,spending bynon-proﬁt institutions serving households (other thansocial insurance),and direct service payments by privatecorporations.The data in the table are the product ofaneffort by the World Health Organization (WHO),the Orga-nization for Economic Co-operation and Development(OECD),and the World Bank to collect all available infor-mation on health expenditures from national and local gov-ernment budgets,national accounts,household surveys,insurance publications,international donors,and existingtabulations.Total health expenditure is the sum ofpublic and privatehealth expenditure.It covers the provision ofhealth services(preventive and curative),family planning activities,nutri-tion activities,and emergency aid designated for health butdoes not include provision ofwater and sanitation.The datain the table are the product ofan effort by the World HealthOrganization (WHO),the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),and the World Bankto collect all available information on health expendituresfrom national and local government budgets,nationalaccounts,household surveys,insurance publications,inter-national donors,and existing tabulations.Table 4.Service indicatorsPrimary teacher absence rateis the percentage ofprimaryschool teachers who were absent from a random sample ofschools during surprise visits.Absenteeism ofpublic servants from their jobs has longbeen discussed as an impediment to effective public servicedelivery in developing countries,yet there has been relativelylittle systematic empirical evidence on this issue.As back-ground research for this World Development Report,severalcountry studies were conducted.A multi-county studyBangladesh,Ecuador,India (20 States),Indonesia,Peru,andUganda (Chaudhury and others 2003).Additional studieswith virtually identical methodologies were conduncted inPapua New Guinea (NRI and World Bank 2003) and Zambia(Habyarimana and others 2003).The common survey methodology was built aroundunannounced visits to a nationally representative randomsample ofprimary schools and primary health care centers.The study used clustered random sampling:after stratifyingeach country (or Indian state) geographically,districts wererandomly selected on a population-weighted basis,and thenfacilities were randomly selected in each district.Enumera-tors visited each facility and,after verifying workers’sched-ules,recorded which ofthem were absent.The ﬁgures in the table are preliminary calculations,based on data from surveys conducted mostly in late 2002and early 2003.Further research will reﬁne the calculations,in some cases drawing on data from additional visits to eachfacility.In addition,these facility surveys have collected awealth ofinformation now being used to probe the causes ofteacher and health personnel absence in the different coun-tries.Note that these studies did not measure “absenteeism,”which is a term that is usually used to imply unjustiﬁable orunexplained absence,but instead reported on rates of“absence.”That is,they reported the number ofstaffwhoSelected World Development Indicators26729_WDR_pgs 264-272.qxd  8/14/03  4:14 PM  Page 267(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

were supposed to be on duty but were in fact absent from thefacility - without regard to the reasons for absence.Manypersonnel were doubtless absent for valid reasons,such asauthorized leave or ofﬁcial duties.Nevertheless,we reportthe absence rates for two reasons:ﬁrst,because the reasonsfor absence given by facility directors were typically not veri-ﬁable;and second,because even authorized absences reducethe quantity and quality ofpublic services in these primaryschools and primary health centers.Primary pupil-teacher ratio is the number ofpupilsenrolled in primary school divided by the number ofpri-mary school teachers (regardless oftheir teaching assign-ment).The comparability ofpupil-teacher ratios acrosscountries is affected by the deﬁnition ofteachers and by dif-ferences in class size by grade and in the number ofhourstaught.Moreover,the underlying enrollment levels are sub-ject to a variety ofreporting errors.They are based on datacollected during annual school surveys,which are typicallyconducted at the beginning ofthe school year.They do notreﬂect actual number ofattendance.And school administra-tors may report exaggerated enrollments,especially ifthereis a ﬁnancial incentive to do so.While the pupil-teacher ratiois often used to compare the quality ofschooling acrosscountries,it is often weakly related to the value added ofschooling systems (Behrman and Rosenzweig 1994).Thedata are from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics,whichcompiles international data on education in cooperationwith national commissions and national statistical services.Trained teachers in primary school:are the percentageofprimary school teachers who have received the minimumorganized teacher training (preservice or in service) requiredfor teaching.The share oftrained teachers in primaryschools measures the quality ofthe teaching staff.It does nottake account ofcompetencies acquired by teachers throughtheir professional experience or self-instruction,or ofsuchfactors as work experience,teaching methods and materials,or classroom conditions,all ofwhich may affect the qualityofteaching.Since the training teachers receive varies greatly,care should be taken in comparing across countries.Thedata are from the UNESCO Institute for Statistics,whichcompiles international data on education in cooperationwith national commissions and national statistical services.Health personnel absence rate is the percentage ofmed-ical personnel at primary health clinics who were absentfrom a random sample ofschools during surprise visits.(Seethe technical notes on the primary teacher absencerate forfurther information).Child immunization rateis the percentage ofchildrenunder one year ofage receiving vaccination coverage for fourdiseases—measles and diphtheria,pertussis (whoopingcough),and tetanus (DPT).A child is considered adequatelyimmunized against measles after receiving one dose ofvac-cine,and against DPT after receiving three doses.Tuberculosis treatment success rateis the percentage ofnew,registered smear-positive (infectious) cases that werecured or in which a full course oftreatment was completed.Data on the success rate oftuberculosis treatment are pro-vided for countries that have implemented the recom-mended control strategy:directly observed treatment,shortcourse (DOTS).Countries that have not adopted DOTS orhave only recently done so are omitted because oflack ofdata or poor comparability or reliability ofreported results.Physiciansare graduates ofany faculty or school ofmed-icine who are working in the country in any medical ﬁeld(practice,teaching,research).Data are from the WHO andOECD,supplemented by country data.Hospital bedsinclude inpatient beds available in public,private,general,and specialized hospitals and rehabilitationcenters.In most cases beds for both acute and chronic careare included.Data are from the WHO and OECD,supple-mented by country data.Inpatient admission rateis the percentage ofthe popula-tion admitted to hospitals during a year.Data are from theWHO and OECD,supplemented by country data.Access to an improved water sourcerefers to the per-centage ofthe population with reasonable access to an ade-quate amount ofwater from an improved source,such as ahousehold connection,public standpipe,borehole,pro-tected well or spring,or rainwater collection.Unimprovedsources include vendors,tanker trucks,and unprotectedwells and springs.Reasonable access is deﬁned as the avail-ability ofat least 20 liters a person a day from a source withinone kilometer ofthe dwelling.The data are based on surveysand estimates provided by governments to the Joint Moni-toring Programme ofthe WHO and United Nations Chil-dren’s Fund (UNICEF).The coverage rates for water arebased on information from service users on the facilitiestheir households actually use rather than on informationfrom service providers,who may include nonfunctioningsystems.Access to drinking water from an improved sourcedoes not ensure that the water is safe or adequate,as thesecharacteristics are not tested at the time ofthe surveys.Access to improved sanitation facilities refers to the per-centage ofthe population with at least adequate access toexcreta disposal facilities (private or shared but not public)that can effectively prevent human,animal,and insect con-tact with excreta.Improved facilities range from simple butprotected pit latrines to ﬂush toilets with a sewerage connec-tion.To be effective,facilities must be correctly constructedand properly maintained.The data are based on surveys andestimates provided by governments to the Joint MonitoringProgramme ofthe WHO and United Nations Children’sFund (UNICEF).The coverage rates for sanitation are basedon information from service users on the facilities theirhouseholds actually use rather than on information fromservice providers,who may include nonfunctioning systems.268WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 200429_WDR_pgs 264-272.qxd  8/14/03  4:14 PM  Page 268(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

Table 5.Foreign aid recipient indicatorsNet ofﬁcial development assistance or ofﬁcial aidcover netconcessional ﬂows to developing countries,transitioneconomies ofEastern Europe and the former Soviet Unionand to certain advanced developing countries and territoriesas determined by the Development Assistance Committee(DAC) ofthe OECD.The ﬂows are from members oftheDAC,multilateral development agencies,and certain Arabcountries.Data on aid are compiled by DAC and publishedin its annual statistical report,Geographical Distribution ofFinancial Flows to Aid Recipients,and in the DAC chairman’sannual report,Development Co-operation.The 2001 dataexclude aid from the World Food Programme because theorganization implemented an annual program budget in2002,and the 2001 data are not yet consistent with the DACreporting system.Aid dependency ratiosNet ofﬁcial aid or ofﬁcial devel-opment assistance as a percentage ofGNI,gross capital for-mation and central government expenditure and aid percapita provide a measure ofthe recipient country’s depen-dency on aid.They are calculated using values in U.S.dollarsconverted at ofﬁcial exchange rates.Gross capital formationconsists ofoutlays on additions to the ﬁxed assets oftheeconomy,net changes in the level ofinventories,and netacquisitions ofvaluables.Central government expenditureincludes both current and capital (development) expendi-tures and excludes lending minus repayments.For deﬁni-tions ofpopulation and GNI,please see table 1.Donor fragmentation indexA Herﬁndahl index ofdonor concentration is calculated by summing the squaredshares ofaid over all donor agencies with positive gross dis-bursements ofofﬁcial development assistance (ODA/OA) inthe recipient country during the year.This index,whichranges from 0 to 1,is then subtracted from 1,to form anindex ofdonor fragmentation,with high values indicatinggreater fragmentation.Data,and list ofdonor agencies,arefrom the OECD DAC’s Geographical Distribution ofFinan-cial Flows to Aid Recipients.Table 6.Aid ﬂows from Development AssistanceCommittee membersNet ofﬁcial development assistanceand net ofﬁcial aidrecord the actual international

advanced countries ofCentral and Eastern Europe,thecountries ofthe former Soviet Union,and certain advanceddeveloping countries and territories.Flows to these recipi-ents that meet the criteria for ODA are termed ofﬁcial aid.Measures ofaid ﬂows from the perspective ofdonors dif-fer from recipients’perceived aid receipts for two main rea-sons.First,aid ﬂows include expenditure items about whichrecipients may have no precise information,such as develop-ment-oriented research,stipends and tuition costs for aid-ﬁnanced students in donor countries,or payment ofexpertshired by donor countries.Second,donors record their con-cessional funding (usually grants) to multilateral agencieswhen they make payments,while the agencies make fundsavailable to recipients with a time lag and in many caes in theform ofsoft loans where donors’grants have been used toreduce the interest burden over the life ofthe loan.All datain this table—including GNI,population,general govern-ment disbursement—come from and are calculated by theOECD.Data are shown at current prices and dollar exchangerates.Aid as a percentage ofGNIshows the donor’s contribu-tions ofODA or ofﬁcial aid as a share ofits gross nationalincome.Average annual percentage change in volumeand aidper capita ofdonor countryare calculated using 2000exchange rates and prices.Aid as a percentage ofgeneral government disburse-mentshows the donor’s contributions ofODA as a share ofpublic spending.Untied aidis the share ofODA that is not subject torestrictions by donors on procurement sources.Table 7.Key indicators for other economiesPopulationis based on the de facto deﬁnition ofpopulation,which counts all residents regardless oflegal status or citi-zenship—except for refugees not permanently settled in thecountry ofasylum,who are generally considered part ofthepopulation oftheir country oforigin.The values shown aremidyear estimates for 2002.Surface areais a country’s total area,including areasunder inland bodies ofwater and some coastal waterways.Gross national income (GNI)is the sum ofvalue addedby all resident producers plus any product taxes (less subsi-dies) not included in the valuation ofoutput plus netreceipts ofprimary income (compensation ofemployeesand property income) from abroad.Data are in current U.S.dollars converted using the World Bank Atlas method (seethe technical notes for Table 1 and the section on statisticalmethods).GNI per capitais gross national income divided bymidyear population.GNI per capita in U.S.dollars is con-verted using the World Bank Atlas method.PPP

power parity rates.An international dollar has the same pur-chasing power over GNI as a U.S.dollar has in the UnitedStates.(See the technical notes for Table 1).Gross domestic product (GDP) per capita growth isbased on GDP measured in constant prices.GDP is the sumofvalue added by all resident producers plus any producttaxes (less subsidies) not included in the valuation ofoutput.Growth is calculated from constant price GDP data in localcurrency.(See the technical notes for Table 1).Life expectancy at birthis the number ofyears a new-born infant would live ifprevailing patterns ofmortality atthe time ofits birth were to stay the same throughout its life.Reduce child mortality—under-ﬁve mortality rateisthe probability that a newborn baby will die before reachingage ﬁve,ifsubject to current age-speciﬁc mortality rates.Theprobability is expressed as a rate per 1,000.Primary completion rate is the number ofstudents suc-cessfully completing the last year of(or graduating from)primary school in a given year,divided by the number ofchildren ofofﬁcial graduation age in the population.Adult illiteracy rateis the percentage ofadults ages 15and above who cannot,with understanding,read and write ashort,simple statement about their everyday life.Statistical methods This section describes the calculation ofthe least-squaresgrowth rate,the exponential (endpoint) growth rate,and theWorld Bank’s Atlas methodology for calculating the conver-sion factor used to estimate GNI and GNI per capita in U.S.dollars.Least-squares growth rate.Least-squares growth rates areused wherever there is a sufﬁciently long time series to per-mit a reliable calculation.No growth rate is calculated ifmore than halfthe observations in a period are missing.The least-squares growth rate,r,is estimated by ﬁtting alinear regression trendline to the logarithmic annual valuesofthe variable in the relevant period.The regression equa-tion takes the form ln Xt= a + bt,which is equivalent to the logarithmic transformation ofthecompound growth equation,Xt= Xo(1 +r)t.In this equation,X is the variable,t is time,and a = log Xoand b = ln (1+ r) are the parameters to be estimated.Ifb* isthe least-squares estimate ofb,the average annual growthrate,r,is obtained as [exp(b*)–1] and is multiplied by 100 toexpress it as a percentage.The calculated growth rate is an average rate that is repre-sentative ofthe available observations over the entire period.It does not necessarily match the actual growth rate betweenany two periods.Exponential growth rate.The growth rate between twopoints in time for certain demographic data,notably laborforce and population,is calculated from the equation r = ln (pn/p1)/n,where pnand p1are the last and ﬁrst observations in theperiod,n is the number ofyears in the period,and ln is thenatural logarithm operator.This growth rate is based on amodel ofcontinuous,exponential growth between twopoints in time.It does not take into account the intermediatevalues ofthe series.Note also that the exponential growthrate does not correspond to the annual rate ofchange mea-sured at a one-year interval which is given by(pn– pn – 1)/pn– 1.World Bank Atlas method.In calculating GNI and GNI percapita in U.S.dollars for certain operational purposes,theWorld Bank uses the Atlas conversion factor.The purpose ofthe Atlas conversion factor is to reduce the impact ofexchange rate ﬂuctuations in the cross-country comparisonofnational incomes.The Atlas conversion factor for any year is the average ofacountry’s exchange rate (or alternative conversion factor) forthat year and its exchange rates for the two preceding years,adjusted for the difference between the rate ofinﬂation inthe country,and through 2000,that in the G-5 countries(France,Germany,Japan,the United Kingdom,and theUnited States).For 2001 onwards,these countries includethe Euro Zone,Japan,the United Kingdom,and the UnitedStates.A country’s inﬂation rate is measured by the changein its GDP deﬂator.The inﬂation rate for G-5 countries (through 2000),orthe Euro Zone,Japan,the United Kingdom,and the UnitedStates (for 2001 onwards),representing international inﬂa-tion,is measured by the change in the SDR deﬂator.(Specialdrawing rights,or SDRs,are the IMF’s unit ofaccount.) TheSDR deﬂator is calculated as a weighted average ofthe G-5countries’(through 2000,and the Euro Zone,Japan,theUnited Kingdom,and the United States for 2001 onwards)GDP deﬂators in SDR terms,the weights being the amountofeach country’s currency in one SDR unit.Weights varyover time because both the composition ofthe SDR and therelative exchange rates for each currency change.The SDRdeﬂator is calculated in SDR terms ﬁrst and then convertedto U.S.dollars using the SDR to dollar Atlas conversion fac-tor.The Atlas conversion factor is then applied to a country’sGNI.The resulting GNI in U.S.dollars is divided by themidyear population to derive GNI per capita.270WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 200429_WDR_pgs 264-272.qxd  8/14/03  1:39 PM  Page 270(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank

When ofﬁcial exchange rates are deemed to be unreliableor unrepresentative ofthe effective exchange rate during aperiod,an alternative estimate ofthe exchange rate is used inthe Atlas formula (see below).The following formulas describe the calculation oftheAtlas conversion factor for year t:and the calculation ofGNI per capita in U.S.dollars foryear t:Y$t= (Yt /Nt)/e*twhere et*is the Atlas conversion factor (national currency tothe U.S.dollar) for year t,etis the average annual exchangerate (national currency to the U.S.dollar) for year t,ptis theeeppppeppppetttttStSttttStSt*=++−−−−−−13222111$$$$GDP deﬂator for year t,pt S$is the SDR deﬂator in U.S.dol-lar terms for year t,Yt $is the Atlas GNI per capita in U.S.dollars in year t,Yt is current GNI (local currency) for year t,and Ntis the midyear population for year t.Alternative conversion factorsThe World Bank systematically assesses the appropriatenessofofﬁcial exchange rates as conversion factors.An alterna-tive conversion factor is used when the ofﬁcial exchange rateis judged to diverge by an exceptionally large margin fromthe rate effectively applied to domestic transactions offor-eign currencies and traded products.This applies to only asmall number ofcountries,as shown in Primary Data Docu-mentationtable in World Development Indicators 2003.Alter-native conversion factors are used in the Atlas methodologyand elsewhere in the Selected World Development Indicatorsas single-year conversion factors.Selected World Development Indicators27129_WDR_pgs 264-272.qxd  8/14/03  1:40 PM  Page 271(c) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank
