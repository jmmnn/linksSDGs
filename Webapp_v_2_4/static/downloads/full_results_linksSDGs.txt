Equity and the 
Prosperity of Cities

The past few decades have witnessed a notable surge in 
economic growth, but one which has been accompanied 
by an equally daunting degree of inequity under various 
forms, with wider income gaps and deepening poverty 
in many cities across the world.

Economic inequality is seriously detrimental to the 
equitable distribution among individuals of opportunities 

FACT Cities must realize 

that equity has 
a significant impact on 
economic performance, 
since the greater the degree 
of equity, the greater the 
chances of a fuller, more 
efficient use of available 
resources, including skills 
and creative talent.1

FACT As understood in 

this Report urban 
prosperity thrives on equity, 
which involves reduction 
in barriers on individual/
collective potential, 
expansion of opportunities, 
and strengthening of 
human agency2 and civic 
engagement.

Recent  studies  suggest  that  pollution  tran-

problems related to rapid growth; and high-

wealthy lifestyles.70 So, while affluence reduces 
the “brown” pollution problems of low-income 
cities, such as poor water supply, sanitation and

  Urban Energy Demand Densities 

 This  Section  illustrates  the  concept  of  energy  supply  and  demand 
densities both generally and by drawing from contrasting examples of 
two high-density megacities (Tokyo and London), as well as a small, 
low-density city (Osnabr ü ck, Germany).

Urban Energy Systems 

Chapter 18

 Keeping  the  above  caveats  in  mind,  the  factors  that  determine  urban 
energy use can be classified into a few major groups:  natural environment  
(geographic location, climate, and resource endowments),  socioeconomic 
characteristics  of a city (household characteristics, economic structure and 
dynamics, demography),  national/international urban function and inte-
gration  (i.e., the specific roles different cities play in the national and glo-
bal division of labor, from production and a consumption perspectives), 
 urban  energy  systems  characteristics  including  governance  and  access  
(i.e., the structure and governance of the urban energy supply system and 
its characteristics), and last, but certainly not least,  urban form  (including 
the  built  urban  environment,  transportation  infrastructure,  and  density 
and functional integration or separation of urban activities).

Urban energy demand is,

in nonurban settings or national averages, but it is structured by the 
influence of other variables, such as urban form (e.g., higher settlement

specific heating fuels, or income (e.g., more affluent urban households 

use more air conditioning), that can amplify or dampen the effect of 
climate variations on urban energy demand.

tial opposition to ‘top-down’ policies) and its crucial importance to the 
very functionality of cities.

  Efﬁ cient Cities: Doing More with Less Energy 

 From all the major determinants of urban energy use – climate, inte-
gration into the global economy, consumption patterns, quality of built 
environment,  urban  form  and  density  (including  transport  systems), 
and urban energy systems and their integration – only the final three 
are amenable to an urban policymaking context and therefore should 
receive priority.

Conceptualising gendered poverty and empowerment

Despite considerable theoretical advances in understanding 

gendered poverty and a long-standing recognition of the 
need to ‘en-gender’ urban analysis and policy, the field of 
conceptualising gender in relation to urban prosperity is much 
less established.24 This is possibly because women are more 
often the ‘losers’ rather than ‘winners’ in urban environments, 
as they are in societies more generally.

This has entailed important critiques of the notion 
of a ‘feminisation of poverty, particularly the  argument that

in paid work too.25

By the same token, ‘double burdens’ of labour are 

increasingly affecting all women and has led scholars like 
Sylvia Chant to advance an alternative formulation of the 
‘feminisation of poverty’ under the rubric of a ‘feminisation of 
responsibility and/or obligation’.

Gendered divisions of labour in the urban economy

The health of urban economies owes as much to the unpaid 
‘reproductive’ labour that fall disproportionately on women’s 
shoulders at household and community levels as to the more 
valued remunerated work where men’s labour is concentrated 
and which is registered in GDP and in the System of National 
Accounts (SNA).45 Although women across developing regions 
are increasingly engaging in paid as well as unpaid activities, 
this has not been matched by an increase in domestic labour 
and unpaid care work among men.46 These inequities add-
up to a female-biased reproduction tax47 which undermines 
women’s productivity gains and their prospects of benefitting 
from and contributing to urban prosperity.

An ‘urban penalty’ in health for slum women

There is evidence to suggest that slum populations generally 

fare worse in terms of physical and mental ill-health alike 
than non-slum residents linked with inadequate public 
healthcare and problems of spatial inaccessibility, as well as by 
inability to afford costly private alternatives.30 In turn, most 
developing countries now face a ‘double disease burden’ of 
non-communicable and communicable disease.31 Research 
based on India’s 2005-6 National Family Health Survey 
(NFHS-3) in the context of eight large Indian cities – Chennai, 
Delhi, Hyderabad, Indore, Meerut, Mumbai and Nagpur 
-  revealed that slum dwellers suffer a disproportionate risk of

of mental health, at a global level, depression has been found 
to disproportionately affect women and the poor.39 Recent 
evidence from Cape Town, South Africa demonstrates a higher 
prevalence of Common Mental Disorders (CMDs) in peri-
urban slums (35 per cent) compared with rural areas (27 per 
cent), and that gender (being female), unemployment and 
substance abuse are the most common correlates.40 In such 
circumstances, basic upgrading of urban slums can have major 
positive effects on women’s general health as in the award-
winning multi-stakeholder Ahmedabad Slum Networking 
Programme in India (See also Box 2.1.3 on Agra).41 Service 
improvements such as electrification and water access are 
not only likely to improve health outcomes in immediate 
ways, but also to alleviate the strains attached to longer-term

Policies to address women’s unpaid

While this section addresses the range of possible policies to 
reduce gender inequalities in ‘quality of life and infrastructure’, 
‘productivity’ and ‘equity in power and rights’ for increasing 
women’s prosperity in cities, it is vital at the outset to highlight 
one of the most fundamental issues affecting gender equality, 
namely women’s unpaid reproductive work.3

Unpaid reproductive work needs much greater valorisation

pricing of foodgrains, tighter controls on

inequality in outcomes and stagnating
income poverty between the late 1980s and
early 1990s.This was probably inequitable in
terms of rising inequality of opportunity.

As  reflected  in  the  limited  resources  available  for  good

members are automatically excluded from a wide range of the 
outcomes associated with economic growth and globalization 
–  including  demand  for  a  skilled  and  healthy  labour  force.

Heightened  concerns  over  climate  change,  rising
gasoline prices, trafﬁc congestion and social exclusion
have sparked renewed interest to explore the link
between mobility and urban form.1 Worldwide, city

time, air quality, road accidents, social integration,
better  accessibility  and  improved  use  of  different
modal trans port solutions.

Planning and Design for Sustainable Urban Mobility

NOTES

1 In this report, the term ‘urban

form’ is used broadly to express
the physical layout, design, space
and morphology of cities,
including buildings, roads and
streets.

Without  a  good  public
trans portation  system,  travellers  face  a  complex
trade-off between shelter security, travel distance and
travel mode.3 At the same time, non-motorized road
users (primarily pedestrians and cyclists) and public

trans port users – particularly in devel op ing countries
– are often overlooked in the design and modern -
ization of transportation infra struc ture.4

As  noted  in  Chapter  1,  the  main  purpose  of
urban  mobility  systems  is  to  provide  access  to 
basic goods, services and activities – such as work,
education, medical care, shopping, socializing – and
to  enable  people  to  participate  in  civic  life.

‘who often bear the greatest burden of poverty’.5 Yet,
in reality, people and communities do not have equal
